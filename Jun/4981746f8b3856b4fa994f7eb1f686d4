The EFCC boss said nobody in the commission wants to take credit for the battle against corruption because it is a duty to be done.  He said: “It is quite humbling to be found worthy of an induction into the Integrity Hall of Fame of our great President. President Muhammadu Buhari, no doubt, has established great reputation globally as an ardent and committed anti-corruption fighter. “His appointment as First-ever African Union Anti-Corruption Fighter bears great credence to his commitment to the fight against corruption. I, therefore, consider it a great honour to be inducted into such integrity realm by the Arewa House… “We are doing all these not because we desire special credit for them but because we see them as a duty to be done. We see anti-corruption as a proof of our patriotism and commitment to human growth and development…”
