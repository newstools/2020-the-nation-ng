Secretary of the Nigerian Boxing Board of Control (NBB of C), Remi Aboderin, has stated that the new broadcast regulations released by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) is unbeneficial to boxing and other sports in the country. Aboderin, who is also the President, West African Boxing Union (WABU), contended that the drafters of the new broadcast regulation are only interested in football. For instance, said Aboderin, the code stipulates that if a broadcaster has the right to air football on its platform, it can only be involved in the sponsorship of football and no other sport in Nigeria and must commit 30 per cent of the sum spent on acquiring rights to international football to the sponsorship of the local equivalent.  He wondered why the NBC will state in the code that the promotion of Nigerian sports is paramount when its regulation actually seeks to stifle other sports aside from football. “The NBC does not seem to understand that the little exposure and popularity as well as the financial support the other sports have been enjoying will evaporate if this code is implemented. There is a need to revisit this section and do what it right for sports other than football,” he said.
