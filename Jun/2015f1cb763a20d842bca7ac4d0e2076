The death of the Senator representing Lagos East Senatorial District, Bayo Osinowo, has dug a gorge in the political ranks of the Progressives in the Senate and our Nation, the Senate said on Monday night. Chairman, Senate Committee on Media and Public Affairs, Senator Ajibola Basiru, in a reaction to the demise of the Lawmaker whom he described as one of the trusted right hand men of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu said Bayo Osinowo was a kind, large hearted and hardworking politician whose roles in entrenching progressive politics in Lagos were quite pivotal. According to the Osun Central Senator, the Lagos East Senator was formidable in the Progressives caucus in the Senate stressing that his transition would create a huge vacuum in the ranks of the Progressives in the Senate. “He was a workaholic lawmaker whose experience in the politics of the nation, Lagos and the Senate cannot be decountenanced. The Senate has lost one of its best brains,” Basiru remarked. Commisserating with Asiwaju Tinubu, the Government and people of Lagos State and the entire progressives family, Basiru prayed that the Almighty Allah comfort the family, friends and relatives of the late Senator Osinowo The deceased Senator was a lawmaker in the Lagos State House of Assembly for several years.
