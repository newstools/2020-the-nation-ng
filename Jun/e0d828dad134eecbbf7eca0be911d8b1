 VILLARREAL coach Javier Calleja has nothing but praises for his squad over a thrilling 1-0 away win at Celta Vigo as the Spanish LaLiga return over the weekend since March due to Coronavirus pandemic. He said it was a ‘complete Villarreal’ performance which saw Nigerian winger Samuel Chukwueze playing a pivotal role despite coming on as a second half substitute. With five substitutions available for each team, the Villarreal coach made a double change in the 57th minute. Chukwueze and Bacca replaced Gerard Moreno and Cazorla. It was the tricky Nigerian that reportedly  created the next big chance. He received the ball out on the right wing, cutting inside to take him away from the Celta defenders and got his shot off, but it went straight at Rubén Blanco. Then in  the 90th minute, Manu Trigueros jumped on the rebound after a fantastic play by Bacca and Chukwueze to send the ball into the back of the net. The Yellows midfielder’s shot looped into the goal after clipping the defender, but it went in and sent the Yellows fans at home wild. “We put in a complete performance, from the start to the end; we could have scored in the first half,” the 42-year-old former Spain international told the club website. “We keep on mentioning the importance of the whole squad. “Those who came off the bench knew what the game needed. The hard work by everyone was extraordinary.” Saturday’s win took the Yellow Submarines to the seventh position on the 20-team log  and inches closer to secure one of the tickets for continental competition. “Europe is a dream that could come true because of the team we have,” Calleja further enthused.“ We came into the game after a bad run and this team is in a position where we can fight to be in Europe. We will fight to make this dream come true.” Meanwhile, Villarreal’s next match is slated for tomorrow  against RCD Mallorca at the Estadio de la Cerámica.
