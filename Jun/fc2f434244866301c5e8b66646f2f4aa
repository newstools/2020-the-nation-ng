The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission  (NERC ) on Tuesday notified seven electricity distribution companies  (DisCos ) on its intention to take action against them for flouting its estimated billing cap. The concerned companies are Port Harcourt, Benin, Enugu, Eko, Ikeja, Kano, Kaduna . NERC gave the  Discos 4 days beginning from June 4, 2020, to explain why the Commission should not sanction them over their alleged non-compliance. NERC had on February 25, this year insisted the energy distributors provide meters for their customers. It barred them from the 11 DisCos from billing residential customers above N1, 800 monthly. In an Order 197/2020 which the Chairman, Prof James Momoh and the Commissioner Legal,  Licencing and  Compliance,  Dafe  Akpeneye issued in the Commission’s twitter handle, the new order amended the 2012 order on estimated billing regulation.
