 FOR over an hour, residents of Jalingo, Taraba State, struggled to save a military man from committing suicide. The soldier, whose name was given as Ali, climbed the Welcome to Taraba Roadblock Tower -over 24fts high, and threatened to jump down. He spoke Hausa and pidgin, saying: “I want to die. Allow me to jump down and die.” But the youth who gathered there begged him not to jump, saying, “We don’t want you to die.” Witnesses said the soldier’s behaviour attracted their attention when they spotted him on top of the tower pulling off and throwing down items of clothing on him. He seemed to have a leg injury. “He is an ex-soldier,” a witness said. Police said they were unaware that an ex-soldier threatened to kill himself.
