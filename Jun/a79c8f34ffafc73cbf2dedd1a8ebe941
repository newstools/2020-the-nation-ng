The acting Managing Director/CEO of Lagos Waste Management Authority (LAWMA), Mr. Ibrahim Odumboni has assured that a holistic approach would be adopted by the authority under his watch to make the Lagos environment cleaner and livable for all residents. The LAWMA boss spoke at an interactive session with journalists at LAWMA headquarters, Ijora-Olopa. He said various programmes and initiatives had been lined up by the authority, to improve waste management across the metropolis. Odumboni said that drastic measures have been put in place to enhance operational efficiency by PSP operators, with particular emphasis on ensuring effective turnaround time at various dumpsites, adding that each disposal truck should not spend more than 20 minutes at the sites. He said the authority would collaborate with other agencies in the state to ensure that the challenge of improper waste disposal was holistically tackled, as establishing a cleaner and healthier environment required collaborative efforts. Odumbomi urged residents to shun all forms of indiscriminate waste disposal which have negative consequences on the environment and people who live in it, adding that the populace should imbibe the culture of recycling and waste sorting, which is being spearheaded by the Authority. He revealed that the agency would soon launch LAWMA Academy programme, targeted at inculcating the tenets of effective waste management into the younger ones. And that through the programme, school children, students, corps members and interns would have the opportunity of being taught the best practices in waste management. He admonished residents to call LAWMA toll-free line for PSP related issues and other inquiries.
