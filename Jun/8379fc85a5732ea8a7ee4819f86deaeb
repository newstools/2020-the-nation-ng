 There are mad people everywhere. Everywhere. In the last few days, we have seen a policeman kill a young girl named Tina. We have also seen a girl raped and killed. And in America, a policeman ignored George Flyod’s cry that he could not breathe. The knee of the white policeman on the neck of the African-American man ceased his breath and threw America into chaos. Protest, protest and protest everywhere. Now, the policeman is standing trial. The killers of Tina and UNIBEN’s Vera Uwaila Omosuwa must be brought to book. They must dance naked for their crime.  The cursed souls, who raped and killed Vera, did it in a church where she was reading and some idiots have had the gut to ask what she was doing in a secluded area alone. It is at a time like this that I feel God should work like the god of thunder and effect instant judgment, but the bastards in our midst know that He is merciful and take advantage. Men need to accept that when a woman says ‘no’, there is no need for further explanation. No is not a word in this sense. It is a complete sentence with no ambiguity.
