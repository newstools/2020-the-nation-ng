Panelists at a recent virtual conference convened by the Academics Stand Against Poverty (ASAP), West Africa chapter, have called on the government to reformulate social policies to combat poverty in Nigeria. Programmes and Policy Director at the International Centre for Development Initiatives, London, Olalekan Fadeyi, emphasised the need for the government to provide social security safety nets to ameliorate the sufferings of the masses. He identified “corruption and the failure of the government to address the challenges posed by social diversities as obstacles in the fight against poverty.” A project manager with years of experience at the Bank of Agriculture, Adedeji Olusanya, lamented that the nation lacked accurate data of poor people. “Inaccurate statistics hamper government policies on poverty, making it difficult for the government to adequately address and cater for the needs of poor people,” he stated. Another panelist, Ibrahim Yeku, a lawyer and founder of Ibrahim Yeku foundation, highlighted policy somersault and inconsistencies as part of what has hindered efficacy of government policies towards eradicating poverty. He added: “I urge politicians to embrace the approach of policy continuity, regardless of political party affiliations or intra party differences.” Coordinator of ASAP West Africa, Oluwaseun Olanrewaju, stated that poverty is complex and multidimensional: “There is a need to consistently engage in robust discussions in order to influence social policies aimed at eradicating poverty. The organisation is currently working towards making the panel discussion a monthly event.”
