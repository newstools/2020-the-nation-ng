An Ile-Ife Magistrates’ Court in Osun, on Thursday, sentenced one Oga Joseph, 21, to five years imprisonment for using ‘magic key’ to unlock cars. The Magistrate, Muhibah Olatunji, found Joseph guilty and convicted him for the offences bordering on entering, stealing and intent to commit felony. The convict, while pleading with the court to tamper justice with mercy, confessed to having a magic key to unlock cars to steal properties. Olatunji said that releasing the convict would not add any positive values to the society, but would rather wreak havoc on the society. The magistrate said that the sentencing would reform the convict and afford him the opportunity to learn one or two vocations that would benefit him at the correctional centre and serve as deterrent to others. She, therefore, sentenced Joseph to five years imprisonment, without any option of fine. Earlier, the Prosecutor, Insp. Sunday Osanyintuyi, had told the court that the defendant committed the offences on June 17, at about 9:10 pm. at Ibukun-Olu Street, Ile-Ife. Osanyintuyi said that the convict entered into a Honda Accord saloon car, with registration number: FFE 707 AC, property of one Adegboyega Ologbenla, with the intent to commit felony. He added that the convict also stole one bag containing the sum of N208,100; two Itel mobile phones and one power bank, all valued at N223,100, property of one Adegboyega Ologbenla. The prosecutor added that Joseph, on June 18, at about 01:53 am. at Ajegunle Street, Ile-Ife, entered into one Nissan Serena bus, with registration number: MT 423 KJA, property of one Olanrewaju David, with the intent to commit felony therein. According to her, the offences contravene Sections 383, 390(9), 412 and 508 of the Criminal Code, Laws of Osun, 2002. (NAN)
