Youths of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ondo State have vowed to resist alleged financial inducement being made by Deputy Governor of the State, Agboola Ajayi, to woo party members to support his aspiration. Hon Ajayi, last Sunday, resigned from the APC and joined the PDP where he hoped to contest for the governorship election. But the PDP youths under the auspices of Democratic Reformation Force (DRF) said it was shameful that some aspirants were already losing supporters Ajayi. Coordinator of the DRF in Ondo State, Prince Ojo Olatunji, said Chief Eddy Olafeso, Barr Eyitayo Jegede and Banji Okunomo were leading PDP aspirants before the Deputy Governor joined the race. Prince Olatunji said it was unimaginable for youths in the PDP to endure pains and hunger for four years only for the Deputy Governor to want to reap where others have laboured. Olatunji stated that the Ondo PDP youths would rather joined the campaign train of Okunomo than deputy governor as a way of rewarding party loyalty. He urged the party national leadership to provide a level playing field for all the aspirants. According to him, “We have remained loyal and committed to this party for the last four years. The party’s leadership must not allow money politics to wish away our seat. “Anybody is allowed to support any aspirant but the method of using money to woo supporters of other aspirants is highest level of deceit. “Those of us in the DRF of the Ondo PDP have pledged to support Okunomo and we have also begun mass mobilisation to counter any move of Ajayi.” Spokesman of Hon Ajayi, Babatope Okeowo, declined comments on the issue.
