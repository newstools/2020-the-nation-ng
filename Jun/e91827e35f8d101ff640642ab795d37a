Chairman of the pro-Godwin Obaseki camp in Edo chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Anselm Ojezua, has assured the governor will be reelected on September 11. He said despite his qualification by the screening committee of the party in Abuja, Obaseki will emerge victorious. Ojezua called for calm among members of the governing party and supporters of Edo Governor, describing his disqualification as “just”. The factional APC chair, who spoke to reporters in Benin after the disqualification of Obaseki in Abuja, stated the outcome of the screening exercise was not surprising. According to him:  “I want to plead with leaders and members of APC in Edo State to remain calm. The validity of the screening committee has not been established. “A proper response to the report is yet to come, as the leadership of the party in the state will meet tomorrow (today) and at the end of the meeting, give an appropriate response.” Reacting to Edo governor’s chances of re-election, following his decision not to appeal the screening result, Ojezua said: “They did not say he would not contest the election but that he would not contest on the platform of the APC. “By tomorrow (Saturday), we will meet and be in a position to make a proper statement on what the future holds for the party (APC) in Edo State.”
