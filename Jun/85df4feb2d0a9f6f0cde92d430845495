 Erstwhile Golden Eaglets captain Musa Muhammed said he was pleased with his progress at HNK Gorica after the Croatian Priva HHL side extended his contract by two more years. Since he turned pro in 2015 after leading Nigeria to her fourth FIFA U-17 World Cup title in the United Arab Emirates, the former Flying Eagles captain has also played in Turkey and Bulgaria respectively with Basaksehir and Lokomotiv Plovdiv before arriving at HNK Gorica in 2018. “ I really feel happy to sign a new contract with HNK Gorica  and this is a good opportunity for me to continue with the good work together with the club,” the 23-year-old Muhammed told NationSport. His contract renewal with HNK coincided with the restart of the Croatian Priva HHL after the COVID-19 enforced lockdown since March and the free-scoring defender said he was happy to be in the thick of action yet again.  “We thank Almighty Allah (God) that we can play football again after the lockdown; the situation is better now and we can begin to fight our way for ticket to play in Europe.” On Tuesday, HNK Gorica suffered a 2-1 away defeat to Osijek where Muhammed was incidentally booked towards the end of the tight encounter. “It is all part of the game but the most important thing is that I always want to give my all when I’m playing and I’m sure we are going to be back to our winning ways.” HNK Gorica is now sixth on the table and they will be at home against run away league leaders Dinamo Zagreb on Saturday. “It is a huge game for us on Saturday but I’m confident of a positive outcome when we play at home,” he said.
