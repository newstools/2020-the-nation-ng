 The Grand Council of Yoruba land (Agbarijo Egbe Odo Yoruba) has commiserated with Osun State Governor Gboyega Oyetola on the death of his Deputy Chief of Staff, Administration, Adejare Adebisi. It said Adebisi, 54, who died in Lagos last Friday after a long illness, was a Progressive to the core, who served under the former governor Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola and Oyetola “with untainted records of achievements.” It also consoled the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, following the death of his maternal grandmother, Madam Comfort Faramobi Ajoke Olasoji.  The group, which stated this in a statement by its President General Awa Bamiji, felicitated with three monarchs, the Elegushi of Ikateland and Oniru of Iruland, both in Lagos, and the Alaafin of Oyo. “We equally facilitate with Oba Gbolahan Lawal on his recent installation as the Oniru of Iruland and the 10th year coronation anniversary of Oba Saheed Adeola as the Elegushi of Ikateland respectively,” Bamiji said. He added: “We rejoice with Oba Lamidi Adeyemi, III, (Alaafin of Oyo) on the birthday of her loving, caring and young Olori, Ayaba Gloria Adeyemi. Behind a successful man, there must be a woman of virtue.”
