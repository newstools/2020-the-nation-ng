An All Progressives Congress (APC) senator, Smart Adeyemi (Kogi West), has donated palliatives worth millions of naira to his constituents. Three million bags of rice and beans were distributed to indigent households by the senator, who also gave financial support to vulnerable people across the local governments. Adeyemi also distributed face masks to the people, warning them that COVID-19 is real and highly contagious. During his tenure in the Sixth and Seventh Senate, the senator had given out 400 cars to constituents, bursaries to 3,000 students, 22 ambulances for hospitals, and sunk 60 boreholes. Adeyemi also facilitated cottage hospitals in five local councils and a stadium in the district. The senator urged the people of Kogi West to increase their support for Governor Yahaya Bello. Speaking in Kabba, the senator promised to render quality representation and attract more dividends of democracy to the district. He said:” I said I am totally committed to Governor Yahaya Adoza Bello and some people went on the internet and said ‘I have sold out our people’. The governor is our brother (from a neighbouring community) if I have any issues or they’re issues affecting Kogi West, I will never come to the public domain. “I will go inside his room and discuss with him as a brother. I had the privilege of being the DG campaign that brought back this government elected. Politics must be synonymous with integrity, morality, faith and sincerity of purpose. You cannot join in building a house and start using a hammer to pull down the house; expect you are a mad person. “Governor Bello has been fair to Kogi West senatorial district and you all know that I will be the last person that will compromise our people.”
