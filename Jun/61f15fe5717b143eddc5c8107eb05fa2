 AWARD-WINNING actor, Chinedu Ikedieze MFR popular known by his moniker Aki has urged the federal government to channel the energy used in sending unsolicited text messages to provide for the citizens in this trying times. Speaking in a live interview with Ubi Franklin over the weekend, he said for a country of 220 million citizens over 70 million people are hungry. “Let me urge the federal government, yes you people are doing your best but find a way to rectify this problem, help these people, they are people that have 0 Naira in their account if you can send me a message, my brother lets keep Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) aside. Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) sent me an SMS my brother, so if INEC could send me, I didn’t even know they have my number. If it was easier for them to do that what happened to our election result. It will have been easier in one day they would have just given us the INEC result, there was no need canceling and doing this and that so if the federal government you know you can send me messages use that same strength to send money to the masses.” He continued “Don’t send to me don’t worry I am okay but send to people N2000, N3000, and N5000 can go a long way to help a family of 1,2 or 3. I can’t help everybody but I believe the federal government can do more than I can do. I am an individual so my brothers no matter the situation you don’t want to go out there and contact the virus, FG you people are trying but please do more”, said Aki. Aki is best known for playing alongside Osita Iheme better known as Pawpaw in the majority of the movies after their breakthrough as a duo in the 2002 film ‘Aki na Ukwa’ and has acted in the role of a kid in most of his films during his early career due to his dwarf stature and physical appearance and later transformed himself into acting lead adult roles.
