FOLUKE Daramola-Salako has said that filmmakers need to produce movies that preach against rape to save the country from rising cases. In a chat with Funmi Iyanda’s Public Eye Live on the topic: ”Combating Nigeria’s viruses and violence pandemic,” the actress noted that celebrities create more awareness on the scourge. “The role of Nollywood is for us to create more awareness programs, have more movies that are preaching the negativity of rape and abuse, the reason it can happen to anybody, and the reason under no circumstances should any rapist be made to look like a good person,” she said. Speaking on her experience as an actress and founder of the “Action Against Rape in Africa” initiative, a movement that seeks to curb rape and bring its perpetrators to book in Africa, opened up that 75 percent of the perpetrators of the rape cases addressed by her NGO are religious leaders. “75% of the cases I have on my table are from religious leaders, and a lot of time, we don’t get to the end of it, because when we start, the family would come and tell us we should leave the religious leader to God,” Daramola-Salako revealed. Continuing the mother of two said it’s hard to find rape cases against young women except for sexual assaults and abuse in workplaces.
