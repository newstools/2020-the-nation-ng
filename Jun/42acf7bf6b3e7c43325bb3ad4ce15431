Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Muhammad Bello on Tuesday declared that Azeez Fashola, popularly known as Naira Marley, alongside those who featured and entertained fun-seekers at the Jabi Lake Mall in Abuja, will be prosecuted. This is coming few days after the Jabi Lake Mall was shut down by the FCT administration following a judgment from a mobile court headed by Magistrate Idayat Akonni, who sat in the premises of the mall to seal it up for two weeks for contravening the COVID-19 protocol. Bello also urged residents of the territory to take personal responsibility for their health and desist from violating the extant guidelines put in place to curtail the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. He reiterated that several aspects of the guidelines as postulated by the Presidential Task Force on COVID 19 as well as the FCT Administration were violated with reckless abandon. According to a statement issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Anthony Ogunleye, the FCT Administration views the actions of the organisers and attendees at the concert as reckless, wicked, insensitive and utter disrespect and disregard both for the law and the wellbeing and welfare of fellow citizens. He also added that the FCT Administration, which “has a responsibility to protect the lives of the citizenry is determined to prosecute all those involved in orchestrating these infractions to the full extent of the law”.
