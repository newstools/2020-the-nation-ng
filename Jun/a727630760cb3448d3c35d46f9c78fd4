 Fourteen Senior Advocates of Nigeria (SANs) have endorsed Dr. Babatunde Ajibade, (SAN), as their candidate for the position of President of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) in next month’s national election. The SANs, all members of Ajibade’s Class of 1989 Nigerian Law School, said having known him for 30 years, they could vouch for his integrity and competence. The other candidates in the race are Deacon Dele Adesina (SAN) and Mr. Olumide Akpata. The SANs are: Prof. Andrew Chukwuemerie Abiodun Jelili Owonikoko, Segun Ajibola, Rotimi Jacobs, Teslim Olatunde Busari, Dr. Kayode Olatoke, Muiz Banire, Emeka Etiaba, Olasheni Ibiwoye, A. U. Mustapha, Emeka Okpoko, Adeyemi Kamaldeen Ajibade, Essien Andrew and Olukayode Enitan.  In a statement yesterday, the SANs said they could “confidently attest” to Dr Ajibade’s “character, integrity, humility, experience, brilliance and hardwork in the legal profession, which led him to achieve the honour of being the first person to be elevated to the rank of SAN from the 1989 NLS Class.”
