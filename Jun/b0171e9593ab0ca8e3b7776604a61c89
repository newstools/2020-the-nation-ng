 THE Senate on Wednesday directed its Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters to screen Justice Monica Dongban-Mensem, who was nominated by President Muhammadu Buhari, for confirmation as President of the Court of Appeal. This followed a motion by Senate Leader Yahaya Abubakar Abdullahi to enable the Senate amend its Order and to refer the confirmation request to the committee, chaired by Senator Opeyemi Bamidele. Senate President Ahmad Lawan said it became necessary to screen the nominee and consider the committee’s report before the Ninth Senate goes on a two-week break to celebrate its first legislative anniversary. Also, House of Representatives Deputy Speaker Ahmed Idris Wase hailed President Buhari for nominating Justice Donghan-Mensem. In a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Umar Mohammed Puma, the Deputy Speaker said: “I believe the nomination of Justice Dongham-Mensem as the President of the Court of Appeal will signal a new dawn in the judicial system where the Judiciary will find it expedient to cooperate with other arms of government and move the country forward, particularly with regards to the fight against corruption.”
