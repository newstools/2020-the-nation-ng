 MANCHESTER United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has reportedly told the Nigerian striker Odion Ighalo to start firing on all cylinders when the English Premier League (EPL) restart on June 17 amid COVID-19 pandemic. Though he has scored four goals and one assist in his eight opening matches following his deadline day transfer last January from Shanghai Shenhua,  Ighalo  in the MUTV Group Chat that Ole was upset with him despite a two-goal haul in the Emirates FA Cup win at Derby County before lockdown. Ighalo was on Monday handed a January 2021 extension stay at the Old Trafford. “Of course, I think it’s more beneficial for us strikers because we have a former striker as coach,” explained Ighalo. “I know that; even in some games we play, he calls you to talk to you. “Like I remember at the Derby game, I scored two goals and he called me to say: ‘You’re the striker. You’re supposed to score three goals in this game!” The 30-year-old will be one of four options available to the gaffer in attack after extending his loan spell until January 2021 and he appreciates the high-quality competition for places in attack, with each forward bringing something different to the party. “I will start with Greenwood,” noted Ighalo. “He’s a very good player. I think I used to see with my eyes he’s looking like Robin van Persie. He can shoot with both feet, he’s a very intelligent player, young and is not afraid. “Anto is a very skilful, good striker who scores goals. Marcus always wants the ball. He can run behind defenders. He can come and get the ball to feet and shoot from any angle. “These guys are very good, very young guys and I’m grateful to be playing with this set of strikers,” he added.
