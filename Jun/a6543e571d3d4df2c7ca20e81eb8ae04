Minister of State for Power, Mr. Goddy Jedy Agba has insisted on development of the power sector for promotion of industrial growth with massive deployment of renewable energy to rural areas. This is coming on the heels of the Federal Government sustenance of its ban on the use of 33KV primary feeders already yielding positive results . In the bid to give adequate supply of power to the masses, some of the electricity distribution companies (DisCos), including Enugu have commenced the development of their 11KV lines. This was brought to the fore in Abuja in the interactive session that Agba organised with the Managing Director, Nigerian Electricity Management Services (NEMSA), Engr. Peter Ewesor; Managing Director, Rural Electrification Agency (REA) and the Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Ahmad Salihijo National Power Training Institute of Nigeria (NAPTIN) Abdullahi Bolaji Nagode. Ewesor insisted “DisCos can no longer use the 33Kv feeder line.”Asked whether the ban was enfoceable, the Director of Distribution, Ministry of Power, Mrs. Briscilla Sapke, said the power distributors are already complying. Ewesor explained that it would assist a faster growth of the 11KV line. The essence of relieving the 33KV line is to provide electricity for the masses instead of premium customers monopolizing it. The NEMSA said until the larger population have access to electricity for over 16 hours daily the effort of the federal and state governments towards adequate power supply would still be in vain. He noted the “regulation does not allow us to use 33 KV line for second distribution. We have grown 11KV faster than we had grown in the past. 11 was almost static.” According to him, the agency has tested 273,00 meters from March this year to date. He noted that some of the meters have not been tested as targeted as a resulting of the Customs Duty constraints that have hindered most of the Meter Assets Providers from deploying the meters.
