Imo FA Chairman, Mazi Amanze Uchegbulam has made a passionate appeal to the Governor of Imo State, Senator Hope Uzodinma to wade into the current impasse in Heartland regarding  a potential  sanction from FIFA over the club’s alleged failure to respect  contractual obligations with  Brazilian Ivo Dos Santos Da Costa. FIFA recently wrote to Heartland and  copied NFF that the Naze Millionaires risk sanction should  they fail to pay up the debt of over 54,000 dollars which is over 21 million naira owed Da Costa while he was a player of the team a few seasons ago. “It is a source of concern particularly as the chairman of Imo FA when I got a copy of a letter written to Heartland from FIFA over their failure to respect contractual obligations and it is a sort of worry for me because of the involvement of FIFA,”  explained Uchegbulam. “If you renege with your contractual obligations with particularly a foreign player FIFA takes up it very seriously. The FIFA relevant committee (Dispute Resolution Chambers) have taken a decision to sanction Heartland. The ruling was in favour of player called Ivo Dos Santos Da Costa. “I never knew that Heartland had a Brazilian player as Imo FA Chairman because I never saw one. I don’t also know how that deal came about. Having said that, it is my wish to draw the attention of the Governor of Imo State, Hope Uzodinma who is the owner of the club that this matter should be resolved immediately,” he said.
