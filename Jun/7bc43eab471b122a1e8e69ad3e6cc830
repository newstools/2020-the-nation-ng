Delgian First Division A club Genk have reached an agreement with Heracles to sign Cyriel Dessers for 4 million Euros, according to reports in the Netherlands. After initially requesting for 6m Euros, the Dutch outfit Heracles agreed a lower transfer fee which will see the Nigerian forward leave the Netherlands in July and sign a four-year contract at Genk. Dessers will come in as a direct replacement for Tanzania forward Mbwana Samatta who left Genk for Premier League club Aston Villa in January. The 25-year-old will team up with Nigerian duo, Paul Onuachu and Stephen Odey at the club. Dessers had an incredible campaign before the Eredivisie was cancelled due to the COVID-19 outbreak as he was the joint-top scorer in the league with 15 goals scored in 26 appearances.
