 THE Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) has shut down operations at its headquarters in Abuja over of COVID-19 scare. The Nation gathered from NDIC’s workers that the decision to shut down the corporation was taken to prevent an outbreak of the Coronavirus crisis. The staff said the headquarters received a lot of visitors in the last one to two weeks when the offices were open, thus raising concerns over the possibility of coronavirus infection. “NIDC headquarters was open to business throughout the lockdown due to exigencies of duty” the staff said. Already, officials of the Federal Ministry of Environment have been called in to prepare the premises for the fumigation. The fumigation exercise is expected to be completed latest by tomorrow. Though the staff said work is expected to resume later in the week, it is, however, unlikely as the effects of the fumigating agents might take a day to diffuse to allow humans into the building safely.
