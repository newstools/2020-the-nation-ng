FOLLOWING its designation as Nigeria’s flag carrier, Air Peace at the weekend operated its maiden flight on the Lagos/London route. It was to demonstrate its capacity for long haul operations. Spokesman of the carrier, Mr Stanley Olisa commended the government for the opportunity it was given to evacuate 327 Nigerians stranded in the United Kingdom. Describing the operations as another window to demonstrate its capacity to fly into destination, the carrier deployed its Boeing 777 with registration number 5N- BWI, which departed Heathrow Airport London for Abuja and later proceeded to the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos. Air Peace Spokesperson, Stanley Olisa said: “We’re delighted to have operated this flight. It unmistakably shows that Air Peace can fly to anywhere in the world, given the required support of the government.” Since March when the Federal Government banned flight operations across the country as a measure to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19, Air Peace has been operating series of ‘special flights’ to and from different countries, including China, Turkey, India, Israel and South Africa. More of such flights are in the offing, according to the airline.”
