Lagos State Government has clarified that event centres in the state are to remain shut for now, as part of the measures taken recently to tackle the spread of coronavirus pandemic. The Commissioner for Tourism, Arts and Culture, Pharmacist (Mrs.) Uzamat AkinbiIe-Yusuf made the clarification following reports in the media that event centres could now open for operations. She maintained that all event centres and cinemas are to remain shut for now. The commissioner explained that owners of various social centres across the state must register their facilities pending when the Governor would give further directives regarding their operations. She explained that the state government is yet to make any disclosure on the date for the reopening of event outfits centres, adding that such disclosure would be made by the Governor provided that the event centres have met all laid down procedures ahead of their reopening including registering under the Register-To-Open initiative of the state government. The Commissioner noted that the initiative was meant to certify the safety preparedness of various business outfits including event centres before they are allowed to re-open for business activities. She said: â€œThe numbers of persons that would be allowed at any event centre will depend on the size of the event hall and this must not exceed one-fifth of the normal occupancy level of each venue. In other words, no matter the size of an event hall, it cannot accommodate more than 500 persons at a time, that is what the guideline says.
