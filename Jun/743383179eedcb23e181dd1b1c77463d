Jose Mourinho has defended his record with strikers ahead of Tottenham today’s  clash with West Ham, insisting “Harry Kane has no problem” given his previous experience with the likes of Didier Drogba, Cristiano Ronaldo and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Arsenal legend Paul Merson expressed his belief that Mourinho’s preferred playing style could force Kane to consider his future at Spurs during his latest column for Sky Sports. After analysing the England international’s subdued performance during Friday’s 1-1 draw with Manchester United, the former Gunners midfielder said: “I think he’ll have a serious think at the end of the season. I don’t see him getting 25, 30 goals next season the way Jose will want to play.” Mourinho hit back at Merson directly during a pre-match press conference, rolling out statistics from his previous spells at Chelsea, Inter, Real Madrid and United as proof of his ability to maximise the output of top attacking players. The Spurs boss said: “I feel a bit strange at some analysis and some comments, especially as it looks for me that have started from Paul [Merson]. I have to say I respect a lot of people like him and because I respect him a lot, I want to be nice in my answer.” In a defiant four-minute defence, Mourinho insisted Kane, who scored seven goals in 10 appearances prior to suffering a torn hamstring on New Year’s Day, would have “no problems” to be effective as he listed the scoring records of his previous strikers during his managerial career.
