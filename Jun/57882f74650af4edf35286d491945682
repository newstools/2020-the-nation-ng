Osun State Governor Adegboyega Oyetola has hailed the leadership and members of the House of Assembly for demonstrating high sense of patriotism, forthrightness and commitment since their inauguration. He also lauded the 7th Assembly for being supportive of the other two arms of government, particularly the executive, without compromising its independence in the last one year. Oyetola attributed some of the achievements the administration had recorded to the hands of fellowship and cooperation received from the house in particular and the judiciary in general. He spoke at a special plenary session organised by the Assembly to commemorate its one year anniversary, at the House of Assembly Complex, Osogbo. Oyetola, who described the House as a critical partner of government in its resolve to lift Osun out of economic dire straits with its support for the Osun’s Economic and Investment Summit, said his administration admired the monumental achievements and people-oriented legislation the House had delivered in the last one year. He acknowledged the support enjoyed from the House during the security challenges occasioned by the national insecurity and the efforts it made to give legal backing to the establishment of the regional security outfit, the Amotekun corps. The governor said: “From its inauguration till today, the 7th Assembly has left no one in doubt about its focus and vision: rendering selfless and stellar services to the people. Our state admires the monumental achievements and people-oriented legislation this noble House has delivered in the last one year.” “The executive has enjoyed robust relationship with this honourable assembly with neither arm compromising its role, integrity and independence. As a government, we owe the successful delivery of our development agenda, which is our pact with the people, to the cooperation of this distinguished house. On behalf of the executive, I thank the house for their tremendous cooperation.”
