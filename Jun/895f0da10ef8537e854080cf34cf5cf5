Former Governor Ayodele Fayose has accused President Muhamnadu Buhari of ‘strangulating’ the ideals and ethos of democratic governance in the country, declaring that democracy will only thrive when the APC-led federal government leaves office. Fayose said that there was nothing to celebrate as gains of democracy under Buhari’s government, saying it was painful that “legacy of free, fair and transparent elections bequeathed to Nigeria by the PDP government has been destroyed, with elections in the country now being held at gun point.” In a statement by his media aide Lere Olayinka on Friday in Ado-Ekiti, the former governor, who berated the APC-led federal government for its alleged open display of contempt for free, fair and transparent election, said peace and socio-economic development can only be achieved, when leaders earn legitimacy through the ballot, He said; “Democracy will return to Nigeria again after President Buhari’s tenure. Today, there is no democracy to celebrate and I have not stopped wondering how we got here in Nigeria. “I am sure Nigerians will still recall that I warned them in 2015. The people mourn when the wicked are in authority while they rejoice when the righteous are in leadership. Today, Nigerians are mourning. “Nevertheless, we must all keep hope alive because after darkness, there will definitely be light,” he added.
