Inspector General of Police (IGP) Mohammed Adamu has ordered Police Commissioner Bolaji Salami to restore the security details of Deputy Governor Agboola Ajayi with immediate effect. The IGPâ€™s directive was contained in a memo addressed to the Police Commissioner through the Deputy Inspector General of Police, Operations, Force Headquarters, Abuja on Monday. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that men of the Nigeria Police attached to the deputy governor were withdrawn after he had defected to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Ajayi last Wednesday cried out that his life was in danger, as policemen attached to his office were withdrawn on the orders of the police commissioner. The memo with Ref. No CB: 2002/DOPS/FHQ/ABJ/VOL/77/168 was signed on behalf of the IGP through Austine Agbonlahor, Assistant Inspector-General of Police. The deputy governor, who accused the police commissioner of working on the instructions of Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu to withdraw the officers, had for a while, been having a running battle with him. Ajayi had engaged in a confrontation with the police at the Government House, following the alleged refusal of the latter to allow him leave the premises allegedly on the orders of the governor. The deputy governor had in a statement released by his media aide, Mr. Babatope Okeowo, hailed the integrity and courage displayed by the majority of the lawmakers for shunning entreaties, inducement and intimidation to impeach him. Efforts by NAN to speak with Information Commissioner Donald Ojogo failed, as he could not be contacted for comments.
