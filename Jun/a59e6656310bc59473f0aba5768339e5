 THE buzz around iSON Experiences office in Ibadan, the state capital, has shown no sign of slowing down, despite accounting for 190 of the 305 total Coronavirus cases in Oyo State. Occupying two floors of the three-storey former Kingsway building standing at the heart of Dugbe, the cityâ€™s central business district, iSON Experiences recently acquired infamy for operating in ways that made its staff contract the virus in large number. As at press time on Tuesday, 190 of its staff had tested positive to COVID-19. The state COVID-19 committee is said to be expanding its net to have more members of staff of the company tested with contact tracing being stepped up. The firm was shut two-and-half weeks ago on discovering that a large number of its staff tested positive to the virus. It was thereafter decontaminated by the committee. Since then, some of the workers have been empowered with digital tools to work from home, according to the firm in a statement. When The Nation visited the building on Tuesday, it was business as usual for other companies occupying the ground and first floors of the building. Traders selling around the building were unperturbed by the news of Coronavirus outbreak at the property as they also carried on as usual.
