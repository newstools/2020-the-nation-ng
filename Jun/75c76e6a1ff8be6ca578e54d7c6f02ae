 A CULT clash in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State capital, on Monday, led to the death of three persons including a 50-year-old landlord. Many other persons were said to have been injured during the clash. It was learnt that the cultists, probably on a revenge mission, opened fire on a pub, killing the three persons and injuring others. The landlord was identified as Mr Niceman Agonebi, popularly known as ‘Honourable’. The female owner of the bar, Madam Odey, had her jaw shattered by a stray bullet while two others received gunshot wounds. Eyewitnesses said the gunmen came on a commercial tricycle at about 8pm and opened fire on their target who was in the midst of people at the pub. The cultists, who were reportedly armed with assault rifles, shot randomly on the street, leaving many residents and passerby critically injured.
