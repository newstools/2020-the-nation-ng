Two indians nationals have been detained by the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) in Lagos for entering Nigeria without proper documentation. The Indians were intercepted by officials of the NIS at Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Ikeja, Lagos. The Lagos Airport Comptroller of the NIS, Abdullahi Usman said the two male suspects were intercepted during the screening of nationals to be evacuated from Nigeria through the Murtala Mohammed International Airport Lagos. The Comptroller disclosed that while profiling the men, it was discovered that they entered Nigeria through the land border and had visa on arrival application approval which they failed to present to Immigration at the border. Alhaji Usman further disclosed that the men had been In Cotonou, in Benin Republic for a month as they had the stamp of that country dated 9th February 2020 when they left and entered Nigeria illegally. He said they did not present themselves for Immigration checks at the border, adding that the two indians 32 and 29 years old would be prosecuted according to the Nigeria Immigration laws as a deterrence to others. Meanwhile, 446 Indian nationals were at the weekend evacuated from Nigeria as part of the ongoing evacuation of foreign nationals as a result of the covid 19 pandemic. In a statement the NIS Public Relations Officer, Mr. James Sunday said the Comptroller General of Nigeria Immigration Service Muhammad Babandede warned migrants to desist from breaking the Immigration laws of countries of transit or destination to avoid sanctions that may result in stopping them from coming to Nigeria.
