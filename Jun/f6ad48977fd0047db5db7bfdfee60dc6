 POLICE in Ebonyi have arrested a former commissioner in the state, Donatus Ajah, on allegations of  murder. Ajah was accused of complicity in the death of a 46-year-old man, Azubuike Inya. Both  Mr Ajah and the late Mr Inya are from Amankwo village, Nkpoghoro community, in the Afikpo North Local Government Area of Ebonyi State. Investigations revealed that the killing was occasioned by intra-communal crisis involving two factions of Amankwo village. One of the factions is said to be led by Mr Ajah while another faction is led by one Ifeanyi Obila. The two groups have constantly clashed in the community as they battled for supremacy and control of the community. Inya was killed on May 23. Police spokesman, Loveth Odah confirmed the arrest. “Yes he is in our custody. We are still investigating the matter,” she said.
