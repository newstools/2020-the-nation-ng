Andron Homes and Delloite Law Firm have taken a giant step in encouraging their staffs to kip fit by taking to sports. These two companies have over the year’s organised competition among their members of staff, which has become a major attraction for the workers. Adron Homes, a leading real estate company, has organised the Adron Games among their staffs for six years while also inviting relay teams of universities and polytechnic to be part of the event. The competition gives the members of staff who are based in different parts of the country the opportunity to come together and compete for honours under a convivial atmosphere.  Adron has also gotten the support of Nigeria sporting heroes who have become regular faces at finals of the events, a development, which gladdens the heart of Adron boss, Oba Adetola Emmanuel King who is a major financier of the games. These athletes and sports stars have also become the Games ambassadors. They are Mary Onyali, Samson Siasia, Victor Ikpeba, Peter Rufai, Ajibade Babalade and Mutiu Adepoju. For Delloite, which held the seventh of its game before the pandemic, the five-a-side football tournament amid other activities have become a huge favourite among members of staffs while former Eagles’ stars like Friday Ekpo , Waidi Akanni, Yisa sofoluwe, Ifeanyi Udeze and Wasiu Ipaye have given their backing to the game.
