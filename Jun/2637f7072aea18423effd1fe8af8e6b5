The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has confirmed that athletes are still banned from protesting at the Olympic Games after several sports moved to allow protests in the wake of George Floyd’s death in police custody. Rule 50 of the Olympic Charter states “no kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas.” As such, athletes who breach the rule are subject to discipline on a case-by-case basis and the IOC issued guidelines in January clarifying that banned protests include taking a knee and other gestures. The IOC reportedly  said the guidelines were still in place and that it would not speculate on “hypothetical cases 13 months before the Olympic Games”.  Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American man, died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes on May 25. His death sparked worldwide protests against racial injustice, with several soccer players in Germany’s Bundesliga delivering their own messages of support during games. Anti-racism movements were  discussed at an IOC executive board meeting yesterday and  reiterated  its stands for non-discrimination as one of the founding pillars of the Olympic Movement.
