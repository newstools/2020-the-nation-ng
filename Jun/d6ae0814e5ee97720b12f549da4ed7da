The Spanish boss explained how passionate he is about changing the way people think after watching his side resume the 2019-20 campaign. Pep Guardiola spoke out on the Black Lives Matter movement after Manchester City thrashed Arsenal on Wednesday, admitting he is “ashamed of what white people have done to black people”. The Premier League put on a unified front against racism as English football returned following a three-month coronavirus-enforced hiatus. Sheffield United and Aston Villa led by example when they kicked off the midweek action, with all players from both sides wearing jerseys displaying “Black Lives Matter” across the back instead of their own names. The two squads took a knee on the pitch just before kick-off in a show of solidarity with the global movement, before the same gesture was seen in the second game of the day at Etihad Stadium. “We should send a thousand million messages for the black people. I’m embarrassed and ashamed of what the white people have done for the black people. “How people can think they are different? All the gestures are good and positive. Everything we can do to make it conscious, it is not acceptable. “We have to do a lot of things for the black people which we have not done so far.”
