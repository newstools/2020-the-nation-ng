Zinedine Zidane insists Real Madrid are not benefiting from preferential treatment from referees after Gerard Pique appeared to concede defeat in the race for the La Liga title. Barcelona were held to a goalless draw against Sevilla on Friday evening and although they extended their lead at the top of the table to three points, Real could usurp them tomorrow should they win at Real Sociedad. Valencia thought they had taken the lead against Zidane’s side in midweek, but Rodrigo’s strike was controversially ruled out because team-mate Maxi Gomes adjudged to have been standing in an offside position.  The decision was ridiculed by Barcelona midfielder Arturo Vidal on social media and Pique appeared to reference it in his post match interview following the stalemate against Sevilla. ‘I think it’s going to be very difficult to win this league,” Pique told Movistar after Barca’s draw in Seville. ‘Now we don’t depend on ourselves… we are going to do everything possible, but I imagine very few points will be dropped. ‘It’s going to be difficult for Real Madrid to lose points and today we lost an opportunity to keep depending on ourselves.’
