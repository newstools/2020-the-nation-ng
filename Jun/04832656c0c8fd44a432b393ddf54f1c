 OGUN State Government has concluded the identification and enumeration of the poor and vulnerable in Ogun Central and listed 60,391 people as beneficiaries of the Take Home Rations (THRs) to households of public primary school pupils, which will begin this month. Commissioner for Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Affairs Mr. Femi Ogunbanwo, who led the monitoring team to Abeokuta South and North Local Government Areas, said the enumeration became imperative to ensure that the right beneficiaries get the palliatives. Ogunbanwo spoke at the weekend after the exercise and the inspection of the THRs items such as bags of rice, beans, crates of eggs, among other items, provided for the scheme. The items were delivered to the Ogun State Government by the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development. He said it was a presidential directive that the Home Grown Feeding Programme in public primary schools should continue through sharing of raw food to pupils in various households across the country during the COVID-19 lockdown. “There is house-to-house identification and verification ongoing in the three senatorial districts of the state, and we are sure that no vulnerable household will be left uncared for,” he said.
