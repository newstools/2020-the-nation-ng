The finals of the Champions League and Europa League will be staged as eight-team, single-match knockout tournaments in Portugal and Germany respectively in August. The decision to kick the competitions back into action was taken by a video conference of the executive committee of European federation UEFA. No decision has yet been taken about whether any fans may be able to attend. This rests with the authorities of the host nations with a decision to be taken no later than the middle of next month. Istanbul, which lost the chance to stage this season’s Champions League Final because of the coronavirus pandemic, will play host next year with previously allocated venues for the subsequent years being pushed back a year: St Petersburg in 2022, Munich in 2023 and Wembley in 2024. The 2020 UEFA Super Cup which was originally due to be hosted by Porto, will now be played at the Puskás Aréna in Budapest on September 24. Looking ahead, UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said: “Football is leading the way back to an almost normal life and I’m proud of the fact that footballers [such as Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford] are leading some of the debates over today’s important issues. “The decision in March to postpone Euro 2020 was a bold one but, I still believe, the right one because it enabled the leagues to resume and play to a conclusion.” He insisted that the mini-tournament concept was a one-off choice and was not a pattern for future seasons.
