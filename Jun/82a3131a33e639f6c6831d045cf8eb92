The Light Interveners Foundation (LIF), an NGO, on Saturday took its COVID-19 awareness campaign to Utako market in Abuja, to enlighten people on how to curb its spread and stay safe. Mr Israel Abam, Chairman of the foundation said that the gesture was to support Federal Government’s effort to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. “We know that the COVID-19 situation in the country and the world is serious so we decided to contribute whatever way we can to the fight against the virus. “No matter how small it is; it will be appreciated. We decided to come to a major market in the city where lots of people come to shop,’’ Abam said. He said that lot of sensitisation needed to be done as people still go about their normal life without minding the effect of the virus. “We found out that many people are not using face mark or observing social distancing. “We are here to create awareness and sensitize the market leadership so that they can educate the community on the danger of COVID-19. “We met with the management of the market to give our message and hope to return to meet with the associations to carry out the sensitization programme. “We need to be alive to do business so people must take care of themselves.’’’ Abam said. He further said that the foundation would be giving out hand sanitizer, cotton high quality face masks and vitamins C zinc supplements. He said that the foundation would also distribute handbills conveying safety measures and personal protection items. Abam added that the foundation would also train selected organisations on crowd control as a measure of safety. Mrs Adaku Okoro,, who sells food items, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that most people in the market do not believe that COVID 19 exist. “People are not taking measures against the virus,” she said. She called on the government to put more effort in sensitising the people.
