Nigerian Institution of Surveyors on Thursday donated a brand new 2019 Model (Partner B9) Peugeot ambulance to Lagos State Government. The Chairman of the institution, Adeleke Adesina, in company with other prominent members of the Lagos State branch of the association handed over the donation to the Lagos State Government and was received by the Deputy Chief of Staff, Mr Gboyega Soyanwo at the Lagos House, Alausa, Ikeja. Adesina commended the Lagos State Government for proactively combating the spread of the virus, particularly with the way the pandemic was handled by placing advisory jingles in both English and Yoruba languages and mass production of face masks. He stated further that if not for the timely intervention and proactiveness of Lagos State Governor and its cabinet members, what we are witnessing  today, as far as the containment of the pandemic is concerned, would not have been possible. “Your Excellency, this address will be incomplete if the efforts of the government under your leadership is not highly commended in this period of the Coronavirus pandemic. We thank God for the proactive nature of the Lagos State Governor and its entire team for setting the ball rolling even when the virus had not entered the country, hence the reason for the successes recorded in fighting the pandemic”, Adesina said. He maintained that the institution was motivated by all the aforementioned activities and achievement of Mr Governor, who also doubled as the Lagos Incident Commander, hence the show of support and solidarity with the government, thereby culminating into the donation of a 2019 Model (Partner B9) Peugeot Ambulance to the State Government. In his remark, the Deputy Chief of Staff, Mr Gboyega Soyanwo,  expressed appreciation to the members of the executives of the Nigerian Institution of Surveyors, Lagos State Branch, for deeming it fit to remember the Lagos State Government,  just as he prayed that the good Lord will continue to bless the members and the entire management of the association. He promised that the donation would be judiciously used and as well get back to them for appreciation.
