Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu has stated he is not fighting against any tribe but for freedome of Biafra. Kanu, who made this disclosure in a broadcast Monday, said while fighting for the liberation of his people, he would not close his eyes against injustice meted out against any tribe in Nigeria. “I am against the slaughtering of Christians from Southern Zaria. I am against the persecution and killing of people from any ethnic group in Nigeria. That is what we are against. “We must stand-up to condemn evil and speak at all time truth. That is why I revered the legendary musician Fela Kuti because he spoke the truth.” He said that people should be allowed to decide whether to belong to Nigeria or not, adding that it would be unfair to lob people together against their wish. “Allow the people to decide where they want to belong. After all Alaska is nearer Canada but they decided to be in the United States.”
