Manchester United progressed to the FA Cup semi-final after a late strike in extra time saw off ten-man Norwich. Odion Ighalo put the Red Devils in front early in the second half before Todd Cantwell equalised with a brilliant strike from the edge of the box. But United finally broke Norwich’s brave resistance after Harry Maguire tapped home in the 116th minute. Maguire says: “It was a difficult game, we wasn’t at our best and sometimes that happens, you’ve got to bang away to get victory. The game turned on the dismissal of substitute Timm Klose in the 89th minute. Norwich were in the ascendancy after equalising and looked favourites to snatch a late winner before the German was shown a straight red for pulling back Odion Ighalo. Neither side particularly impressed in attack, although both goals in normal time were of high quality. The first was scored by Ighalo, who continued his good run in cup competitions with a flicked effort with the outside of his boot in the 51st minute. The second goal was even better. Todd Cantwell, Norwich’s best player in attack at Carrow Road, let fly from 25 yards with a low swerving shot that beat the reach of Sergio Romero. Norwich will now focus on their increasingly difficult task of beating the drop from the Premier League. As for United, this was a patchy display but they remain in contention in two cup competitions and for a top-four spot in the league.
