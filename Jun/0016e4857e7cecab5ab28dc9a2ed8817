An aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the October 10 governorship election in Ondo State, Chief Olayide Adelami, has hailed the ease of doing business strides of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration. Adelami, in a statement to congratulate President Buhari on his fifth anniversary in office, said among many other economic reforms, the 2020 World Bank doing business report showed that Nigeria climbed 39 steps from where it used to be in 2015. He said Nigeria now has a robust service sector where businesses, companies, enterprises and organisations provide services and employment for the broad economy.  Adelami said: “This particular sector contributes more than half to the economy, and has become one of the major points of focus for the Buhari administration. “According to the World Bank Doing Business Report, Nigeria was ranked 170 in the ease of doing business ranking in 2015, but stood at 131 among 190 countries assessed in the 2020 doing business ranking. This means that Nigeria has climbed 39 steps since President Buhari assumed office.” Adelami, a former Deputy Clerk to the National Assembly, also commended Buhari’s tax reforms and other initiatives of the government, impacting positively on the country’s business environment. He said the efforts are evident in the 2020 Finance Act, which makes provisions for micro, small and medium businesses to grow by granting tax exemptions.
