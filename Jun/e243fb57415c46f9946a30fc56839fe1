Ondo State Accountant-General Mr. Laolu Akindolie may soon be sacked for being allegedly loyal to Deputy Governor Agboola Ajayi. Ajayi has fallen out with Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu and is being expected to defect to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Alleged loyalty of the Accountant- General was raised by the Ondo Southern Solidarity Front (OSSF) in a letter to Governor Akeredolu. The OSSF warned Akeredolu of plot by Akindolie to destabilise activities of his administration. A statement in Akure on Tuesday signed by OSSF’s Publicity Secretary Mr. Adeoye Johnson accused the Accountant-General of acting the script of Mr. Ajayi. The statement accused the Accountant- General of refusing to pay less than N200 million of the Ondo State Oil Producing Areas Development Commission (OSOPADEC) fund, but could afford to pay the Deputy Governor’s firm, ITDC, N700 million. A source close to the Deputy Governor described the allegations as untrue. The source said the Governor should sack the Accountant-General if he wants to, rather than making flimsy allegations against the Deputy Governor.
