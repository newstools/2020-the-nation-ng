Manchester City beat 10-man Arsenal 3-0 on Wednesday to delay Liverpool’s bid to win the Premier League title. Raheem Sterling’s opener was followed by Kevin De Bruyne’s penalty before Phil Foden netted on the first day of the Premier League restart. Arsenal’s David Luiz was sent off for the foul on Riyad Mahrez that led to De Bruyne’s spot-kick. If second placed City had lost, Liverpool could have won the title with a victory at Everton on Sunday. Now the runaway leaders still need two more wins to be crowned English champions for the first time in 30 years.
