Tough situations bring out the best in certain persons. As Lagos State continues to find a way to get rid of coronavirus, the Commissioner for Health, Prof Akin Abayomi, has been in the forefront. While Abayomi may be getting little accolades due to the severity of the issue at hand, history will always remember him for what he has done so far. His life has changed since the virus hit Lagos. With the growing recorded cases, it is even hard to tell if he still sleeps or have fun time with his family. How about the fact that he risks his life and that of people dear to him daily by exposing himself to COVID-19 patients? It is also safe to say that the virus has brought out the easygoing medical expert from his shell. Before now, he was a silent member of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Oluâ€™s cabinet and only a few people knew him.
