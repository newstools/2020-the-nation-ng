Odion Ighalo has revealed he was racially abused by a former teammate in China and that he will walk out of the pitch should that happen again. Ighalo recalled that he was abused while he was playing for former club Changchun Yatai. “The guy called me all those kind of names. I got angry and after the game I walked out of the pitch and straight to the dressing room without shaking any hands,” he recounted.  “My team said they will report the matter to the FA, but I didn’t press forward with it.” The Manchester United star said he will take a different stance now. “I will report to the referee, the officials and if they do not take action, I will walk out.” He said education especially of the younger generation will stop racism. We have to educate them, we’re all human, there is no difference, we should fight for humanity, not colour,” he urged.
