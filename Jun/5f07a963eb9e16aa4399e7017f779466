Leicester City and Super Eagles duo of Wilfred Ndidi and Kelechi Iheanacho were in starting line-up Bredan Rogers-tutored side failed in their bid to widen their gap in the English Premier League  as they were held to a 0-0 draw by visiting Brighton at King Power Stadium. Iheanacho, who came in as a substitute in Leicester’s 1-1 draw away to Watford last week, was once again in the starting eleven before going off for Harvey Barnes on 69th minute. Ndidi was on for the entire duration of the match and got a yellow card for a reckless challenge on Tariq Lamptey in the 34th minute. Brighton are on top in the first half and should have taken the lead but Neal Maupay saw his penalty saved by Kasper Schmeichel after Connolly was fouled. Leicester nearly found the back of the net toward the end of the tie. Brighton enjoyed the better of the chances in the first half with Aaron Mooy and Lewis Dunk both having efforts blocked while they did lose Adam Webster who had to come off due to an injury.
