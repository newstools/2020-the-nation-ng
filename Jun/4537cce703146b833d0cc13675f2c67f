Teachers have received training on virtual teaching to equip them with tech skills and how to retain their jobs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The seminar, entitled: “Teacher preparation and Covid-19 snags: Rethinking the models”, which  held on WhatsApp, was the first online colloquium on education in Nigeria. It had in attendance  experts from the six geo-political zones and over 450 participants. Each expert  trained the teachers on how they could attune themselves to this period of Covid-19 and how to use Zoom and other applications to teach students. The event was organised by four  post-graduate students — Iyanuoluwa Olalowo of the University of Ibadan (UI), Stephane Oghuma of Usmanu Danfodiyo University, Sokoto; Ikeoluwapo Baruwa and Tosin Aluko of Ekiti State University. Olalowo explained that the seminar was aimed at enlightening teachers towards adapting to e-learning due to the pandemic. He noted that  they brought experts in the field of teacher education and educational technology, within and outside Nigeria to train the teachers on how to engage learners from pre-school up to higher Institutions in using low-cost, user-friendly learning management systems “LMS”, which puts the teacher and the learner at minimal/no disadvantage of not having a physical class. He, however, urged teachers to be more proactive and tech-savvy to  fit into the new occurrence. “A specialisation teacher needs a more knowledgeable individual in the use of any online platform he/she intends to use to deliver lessons,” he said. Notable experts who featured in the two-day seminar included  Sikiru Kola Babárìndé, a foremost Professor of Pedagogy; Prof. Esther Oduolowu, the  Head of Department of Early Childhood and Educational Foundations, UI, Dr Dara Abimbade, Clemson University Research Scholar of Educational Technology, United States; and Dr Stephane Schaefer, Coordinator of Maryland Association of Education of Young Children, US, among others.
