 National Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomole, yesterday expressed shock at the murder of Mr. Presley Ediagbonya while in the custody of suspected kidnappers. The remains of Ediagbonya, one-time Commissioner for Youths and Sports, were recovered at the weekend by some farmers in a forest sharing boundary with Ondo State at Utese village 14 days after he was abducted and declared missing. The deceased served as Sports Commissioner during the second term of Oshiomhole as Edo Governor. Said the APC National Chairman: “The news came as a rude shock to me. I have fond memories of Edioagbonya while he served as Commissioner under me in Edo…My thoughts and prayers are with his family at this sad moment. I also commiserate with Utese community where he hailed from.” Governor Godwin Obaseki has also expressed sadness and shock at Ediagbonya’s murder. The governor has called on the Department of State Services (DSS), the police and other security agencies to ensure that killers of the ex-commissioner are fished out and punished. He said, “I am deeply saddened by the news of the passing of Mr. Presley Ediagbonya, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Edo State, who was said to have been murdered by his abductors days after his kidnap. “I call on all security agencies, including the Department of State Services (DSS) and the police to…fish out the culprits.”
