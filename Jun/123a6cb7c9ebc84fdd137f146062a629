Delta State Chief Judge, Justice Marshall Umukoro has granted conditional release to 26-year-old Emeka Ozili who reportedly admitted raping an 80-year-old grandmother. Justice Umukoro said the suspect was released due to the victim’s lack of interest in prosecuting the case. The suspect was among 38 awaiting trial inmates freed at Agbor Correctional Centre by the State’s Chief Judge, Marshall Umukoro. On Tuesday, a man, Taiwo Olatunde, 27, was arraigned before an Ado-Ekiti Chief Magistrates’ Court for allegedly raping two teenagers.
