 Edo Governor Godwin Obaseki on Sunday met with his Rivers counterpart, Nyesom Wike, behind closed doors at the Rivers Government House, Port Harcourt. It was gathered that Obaseki, who wore a white long-sleeve shirt tucked in black trousers and an orange fez cap with an inscription Obaseki 2020, arrived the Rivers Government House at about 4pm. After exchanging pleasantries with Wike, who wore a navy blue t-shirt and light blue jeans, Obaseki was ushered into the Government House where he held undisclosed discussions with the Rivers henchman. Though the duo refused to disclose details of their discussion, it was gathered the issues surrounding Obaseki’s disqualification from contesting the APC primaries and his moves to try another platform formed nucleus of their discussion.  Obaseki was said to have visited Wike, seen as the generalissimo and major power broker in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), to help perfect his move to the PDP and emerge as the party’s sole candidate for the coming election in Edo State. But others believe that Obaseki’s visit was part of the ongoing conspiracy by the PDP leaders to capitalise on the feud in APC, win Edo and make the South-South a PDP zone ahead of the 2023 presidential election. Wike on his Facebook page wrote: “Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike recieves his Edo State counterpart, H.E Godwin Obaseki at the Rivers State Government House, Port Harcourt”.
