First-ever Nigeria’s virtual wedding started yesterday and would end tomorrow. The virtual wedding is a brainchild of a seasoned wedding planner, Mrs. Molara Akande. Akande, who is also the founder of Just Weddings and Association of Professional Party Organizers and Event Managers of Nigeria(APPOEMN) said the fair was conceived against the backdrop of the restrictions on social gathering to contain coronavirus pandemic. “Covid-19 is changing the world as we all know, and being a professional in a world that now needs social distancing, we are looking at evolving, hence we came with the virtual wedding fair. “People have been planning their weddings and we don’t expect them to just cancel or put off their wedding plans because of the pandemic.” She added: “The wedding fair is really for people getting married between the year 2020/ 2021 be it a bride-to-be, a wedding/event vendor and anybody who has a passion for the wedding industry. Event vendors will be given a platform to showcase themselves, especially those who have had to go back into the background due to the pandemic; they will now have the opportunity to advertise themselves to prospective clients on a large platform. “We see it more as a wedding market for brides- to- be and potential vendors who are looking for deals and bargains, from the comfort of their homes.’
