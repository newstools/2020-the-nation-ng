The Federal Government has reiterated its support for the International Criminal Court (ICC). It also urged countries that have not yet acceded to the Rome Statute establishing the Court to do so. In a statement signed by Mr. Ferdinand Nwonye, Spokesperson, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Nigeria recognised the importance of the court given the alarming proliferation of the most serious crimes around the world. The statement reads: “Nigeria reiterates its strong and consistent support for the International. Criminal Court (ICC) and its vital mission. “It would be recalled that during the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Rome Statute, President Muhammadu Buhari delivered the keynote address in which he recognised, among other things, that “with the alarming proliferation of the most serious crimes around the world, the ICC, and all that it stands for, is needed now more than ever, in ways that were unforeseen to its founders”. Nigeria restates that position. “President Buhari also urged all States that have not yet done so to, as a matter of deliberate State policy, accede to the Rome Statute, so that it can become a universal treaty. Nigeria hereby repeats that call and condemns any action, or threat of action, that undermines or seeks to undermine the ability of the Court to freely exercise its mandate and carry out its core functions.”
