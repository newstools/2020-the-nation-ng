Tony Bellew is confident that Anthony Joshua can catch out Tyson Fury pretty quickly when the heavyweight rivals battle it out next year. The Brits have finally agreed the financial details for a two-fight deal in 2020, setting up the captivating heavyweight showdown that the boxing world wants to see. WBC world champion Fury, and Joshua, the WBA, IBF, WBO, and IBO champion, have agreed to a 50-50 split for their first fight set for next year and then a 60-40 split in favour of the winner for the rematch. And ahead of their eagerly-anticipated battles, Bellew believes that Joshua can overcome Fury but has warned AJ that he will find himself in a whole lot of trouble if their fight went past four rounds.  “I think he would jump on Tyson Fury and I think he would catch him pretty quickly,” Bellew exclusively told The Gary Newbon Sports Show. “But don’t get me wrong, if that fight was to go past four or five rounds, I think Anthony Joshua would find himself in an awful lot of trouble.”  He has to get rid of someone like Tyson Fury and solve that puzzle and enigma that is Tyson Fury quickly because the more fights go on against him the harder it becomes.’
