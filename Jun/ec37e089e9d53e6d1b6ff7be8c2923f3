Lesotho’s former first lady, charged with the murder of her love rival, was granted bail on Monday, despite objections from the police that she might use it to escape. Maesaiah Thabane, wife of former Prime Minister Thomas Thabane, was arrested at the start of June, after an appeal court revoked her bail on suspicion that procedure was not followed correctly when it was granted. Forty-three-year-old Maesaiah Thabane has been charged with ordering the killing of his then wife Lipolelo Thabane, who was shot dead near her home in Lesotho’s capital, Maseru, in June, 2017. She denies any involvement. When police tried to question her earlier in 2019, she left the mountainous kingdom for neighbouring South Africa. (Reuters/NAN)
