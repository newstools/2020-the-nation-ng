Lawmakers in the Ondo State House of Assembly on Wednesday slammed Deputy Governor Agboola Ajayi over N10million bribe allegation. Ajayi had alleged that Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu bribed the legislators with N10million each to begin impeachment process against him. The deputy governor on Sunday resigned from the All Progressives Congress (APC) and defected to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), but insisted that he would remain in office. The lawmakers said they were not surprised over the allegations because he (Ajayi) “is a drowning man and he will hold on to anything to survive.” The Chairman, House Committee on Information, Akogun Olugbenga Omole, said in a statement that the allegation smacked of naivety on the part of the deputy governor and intended to drag the integrity of the House in the mud. He described the allegation as a lie and politics taken too far. The statement said: “As legislators and elected representatives of the people, we are aware of efforts by Governor Akeredolu to reposition the state and make it enviable among its equals across the country, even in the face of obvious dwindling resources. “How then can someone imagine the members to compromise their mark of honour, all in the pursuit of selfish gains in this period of global recess, which places challenges on the economy of states around the world?”
