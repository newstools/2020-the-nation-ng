The Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) Academy has  advised data controllers to to engage the services of data protection compliance organisations (DPCOs) to enable them achieve the desired compliance in compiling and filing their statutory annual data protection audit. The NDPR, which will beholding its second quarter 2020 certified foundation and practitioner courses virtually, said such engagement, will save them risk penalty as high as N10 million or two per cent of their global revenues, whichever is greater in the event of a data breach. The foundation course will hold on June 17 while the practitioner course was scheduled for June 25th and 26th. The Registrar of the NDPR Academy, Olugbenga Sile said the approach was to assemble professionals in the Personal Data Protection Compliance space especially the NDPR and the European Union General Data Protection Regulation [EU GDPR]) who would through a highly interactive and conducive process, share principles-based practical knowledge of the application of the NDPR. “We understand the challenges the world has had to face as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, technology has provided a seamless alternative to physical learning through virtual learning platforms. The second quarter 2020 NDPR Academy Classes would be taken virtually and we have put adequate measures in place to ensure a hitch-free training process” Sile added. The NDPR Academy trains and certifies a generation of persons that can foster the cause of privacy rights and the NDPR, including its future form. Since December 2019 through its Foundation and Practitioner Programmes, the NDPR Academy has provided relevant training and certification to over 200 participants across various sectors of the economy.
