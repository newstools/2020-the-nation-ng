Wema Bank has urged its customers to embrace its ALAT and its USSD platform *945#. With ALAT, customers can pay bills, transfer funds, buy airtime and data and perform other financial transactions. Head of Brand and Marketing Communications, Wema Bank, Funmilayo Falola, said: “Although the lockdown has been lifted and most businesses have resumed, individuals need to continue to observe precautionary measures to stay safe. Using our alternative banking channels will help our customers stay safe by avoiding queues and crowds and also give them one less place to go. “Given the new normal, we will continue to ensure the safety of staff and customers by leveraging digital solutions that will reduce the risk of physical contact.”
