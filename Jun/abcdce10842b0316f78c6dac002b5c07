  SUPPORTERS of an All Progressive Congress (APC) aspirant in the September 19 governorship election in Edo State, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, are confident he will clinch the party’s ticket. The supporters, under the aegis of Etuno Rebirth Group, a community-based group pushing for the development of Edo State, say Ize-Iyamu will emerge the APC flagbearer during the party’s shadow poll billed for June  22. In a statement signed by the group’s President and Secretary, Bello Mudashiru and Balogun Segun respectively, it described Ize-Iyamu as harbinger of hope and unity. It said the aspirant has shown that he is a sportsman willing to play by the rules and accept collective results, irrespective of personal preferences. The group said: “In a matter of months, the people of Edo State will be heading to the polls again to participate in an election that has gained added importance in light of global events such as COVID-19 that bear local consequences, and unique challenges that continue to confront our people in their collective aspiration for a life of abundance, security and dignity. “The times we are in call for desperate, but measured interventions. And unless we elect a leader who inspires hope, not fear; a leader who rallies the people, not divide them; a leader who displays a heightened ability of restraint and responsibility, not reckless and frivolous actions – we may not be able to meet, and surmount, these challenges.”
