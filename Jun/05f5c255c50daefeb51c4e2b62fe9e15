The National Working Committee (NWC) of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has affirmed Sir John Ochala as the authentic acting chairman of Cross Rivers State Executive Committee of the party. The party also warned impostors parading themselves as factional party executives in the State to desist or face legal charges for impersonation. The party’s position was contained in a statement signed by it’s National Publicity Secretary, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu in Abuja. According to the party’s NWC, Ochala who was the deputy chairman emerged as the State acting Chairman of the party following the demise of the substantive chairman, Dr. Mathew Achigbe in a ghastly car accident in November 2018. The statement further said that the party’s position was affirmed by a Court of Appeal judgement delivered on 23rd April, 2020, which recognises the Sir John Ochala-led Cross River State Executive as authentic and legitimate. According to the statement, “In a unanimous judgment delivered by Justices Emmanuel Akomaye Agim, Adamu Jauro and Peter Olabisi Ige, the Court of Appeal affirmed the Sir John Ochala-led All Progressives Congress (APC) Cross River State Executive as the authentic and recognised executive in the state.” “The Appeal Court also nullified an earlier ruling by an Abuja High Court for lacking territorial jurisdiction to entertain the suit brought by a supposed factional APC executive in Cross River State. “Therefore, its exercise of jurisdiction to hear and determine the suit and the proceedings therein and the judgement delivered by it are a nullity.”
