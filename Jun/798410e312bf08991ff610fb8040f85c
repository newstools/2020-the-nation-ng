Yvonne Jegede recently took out time to celebrate the African child in Lagos, Nigeria. The actress joined the world to celebrate the international day for the African child when she visited less privileged kids on June 16 to have a nice time. In Lagos, the Culturati team alongside Yvonne Jegede visited the less privileged kids home to feed and distribute relief items in commemoration of the International Day for the African Child. Speaking on the visit and celebration, Jegede said, “Love is a sentiment all humans share. Love is its reward when shared. Define yourself—not by how much you are loved, but by how much you love others. I partnered with Culturati Movement in 2020 edition of Day of the African Child, with the theme; “Access to a Child-Friendly Justice System in Africa”, sharing love with children on the streets. The day brings together stakeholders whose main agenda is to improve the lives of African children through the promotion and protection of their rights.” The day of African Child was initiated by the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) on June 16, 1991, and the event honours the memories of the students who were massacred in Soweto, South Africa in 1976 for protesting against education, injustice and inequality in the apartheid regimes rights. The theme of this year’s celebration is to give access to a child-friendly justice system in Africa.
