Ondo State former governor Dr. Olusegun Mimiko has become the beautiful bride for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC), ahead of the October 2020 governorship election. Mimiko is of the Zenith Labour Party, but he is being wooed by PDP and APC leaders. Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu was reported to have met Mimiko last Friday, after which PDP leaders in the Southwest also visited him. Details of the meeting between Akeredolu and Mimiko were not made public, but Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde led some PDP members to visit Mimiko to solicit his support in the coming election. Sources close to Mimiko said the visit was initiated by Governor Makinde, who the source noted, believed Mimiko is still politically relevant. Media aide to Mimiko John-Paul Akinduro said: “Dr. Mimiko is an accomplished political leader, who is a role model to many politicians across party divides. With regard to the coming governorship poll in Ondo State, I can tell you that almost all the aspirants from the parties have come to see him in Ondo to seek his support and mentorship. “You must also know that Makinde is a ‘brother’ to Mimiko. The two speak from time to time on issues of national interest. “The former governor’s priority is for a greater Ondo State. He believes government should be about people and service and this he has demonstrated in his eight years as governor of Ondo State.”
