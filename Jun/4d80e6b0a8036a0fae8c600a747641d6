The House of Representatives on Tuesday summoned the Minister of Industry, Trade and investment, Otumba Niyi Adebayo and the management of the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) to appear before it on Frday, June 26, 2020 to explain why the agency’s account had not been audited in the past six years. The House Committee on Public Account, which is the only constitutional committee in the House is, particularly, not happy with the management of the agency for refusing to appear before it and explain why it had failed to render accounts from 2014 to 2019 as required by law. The committee adopted a motion to summon the Minister, the Director-General and entire management of the SON at an investigative hearing on Tuesday in Abuja. Chairman of the committee, Hon Wole Oke (PDP-Osun) said SON was being given an opportunity to answer audit queries and defend its non-rendition of accounts for some financial years under review, asking the officials to appear on Friday  by 11.a.m or the committee would be forced to appear.
