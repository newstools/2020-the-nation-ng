 The Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare has said that the ministry would be properly guided on deciding the actual date to stage the Edo 2020 National Sports Festival. The minister yesterday received the reports of the Committee set up to review Edo state readiness to host the multi-sports event in the wake of the postponement due to the outbreak of COVID-19. Speaking while submitting its report to the Minister in Abuja, Chairman of the Committee, Tonobok Okowa said the committee had done a thorough job which would help the government decide on the best possible date to host the festival.  According to Dare, “Exactly a month ago this committee was set up, I thank you for keeping to the schedule of your mandate. We shall study your report, sit down with relevant agencies of government to examine the recommendations. The Ministry is properly guided by COVID-19 protocol and will not shy away from taking decisions based on the reality on ground.” He added: “This is a milestone to determine when to start sporting activities, but we would not jeorpadise the health and wellbeing of our sportsmen and women.”
