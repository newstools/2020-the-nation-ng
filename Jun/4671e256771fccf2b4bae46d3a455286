Rivers Commissioner for Sports, Hon Boma Iyaye, said the state is at the ready to host international sporting events with the commitment and determination of Governor Nyesom Wike. Iyaye said as much in Port Harcourt during a courtesy call at his office by the President of Cycling Federation of Nigeria Giadomenico Massari. He stressed that despite the restrictions occasioned by COVID-19 pandemic, the state received Giadomenico to underline the importance attached to sports. According to him, the Rivers State government holds sports in high esteem, hence the hosting of several local, national and international competitions aimed at discovering and nurturing talents. He explained that the Real Madrid Academy being built in the state by Governor Wike-led administration is of world-class and a testimony of his commitment to developing sports, even as he commended Giadomenico for his efforts and doggedness in promoting cycling. “Government alone cannot bring about sports development without the active participation of committed individuals and companies, hence the need for more involvement,” Iyaye stated. “Let me task the cycling federation president to work with the Ministry’s Permanent Secretary, Sir Honour Sirawoo, on the possibility of hosting a national or international cycling event in Port Harcourt.”
