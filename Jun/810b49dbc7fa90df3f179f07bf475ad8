Ikwere, the oldest Local Government Area in Rivers State, has lamented the high rate of truancy among workers in the council. The Chairman of the council, Samuel Nwanosike, explained that out 1,100 workers in the council, only 100 employees report to their various offices every month. Nwanosike, who spoke at the council headquarters in Isiokpe while inspecting his projects on Thursday said he decided to roll out an Information Communication Technology to tackle truancy and ghost workers in the council. He said despite the realities, he continued to pay workers’ salaries but warned that the technology, which would be deployed at the newly built security post would stop the trend. He said: “This security post rebuilt by my administration will be equipped with facilities that will help to scan those who come to work. “The staff dentity card will be scanned before entrance into the council and at the close of work before they leave. By this we will know who is not coming to work. “This will help to reduce the issues of ghost workers. Out of over 1100 workers in the LGA, only 100 come to work. This project will bring that at to end.” The council boss, who toured multi-million naira projects he executed at the council’s headquarters and across the 13 wards of the LGA noted that his team was committed to delivering meaningful project to the LGA. He said the third tier of government exists to drive developmental projects adding that if all the councils were committed to delivering on their mandates, the country would witness massive facelift.
