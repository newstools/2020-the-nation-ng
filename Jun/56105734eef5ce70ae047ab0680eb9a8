Our Reporter The Governor Godwin Obaseki-led administration’s grassroots development drive is transforming the sports landscape in Edo State, with the completion of a number of community-based sports arenas in parts of Benin City, the state’s capital. Special Adviser to the Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, Mr. Crusoe Osagie said the mini-stadia project is an elaborate drive to deepen grassroots development with the construction of 20 mini stadia across the state. According to him, “We have completed 5 of the 20 proposed mini-stadia in the state on time for the National Sports Festival, earlier scheduled for March, 2020 but now rescheduled. “The mini-stadia are in Edo College; Adolor College; School of Health, Benin City; and Western Boys High School; St. Maria Gorreti Girls Grammar School, with each of them equipped with modern spectator stand and other amenities to promote grassroots sports development.” He added that the sporting arenas would serve as key avenues to engage youths in communities and prevent restiveness, as plans are underway to leverage them to groom young sporting talents to represent the state in local and international competitions. A resident in the Dumez Road axis of Sapele Road, Benin City, Mr. Efosa Osaigbovo, said the mini stadium is a welcome development in the area, thanking the state government for prioritizing sports development. He added, “This is a laudable initiative by the state government as it would make the field at the School of Health Technology a platform to develop young talents in the community.” Mr. Eghosa Idemudia, who resides close to Western Boys High School, Benin City, said the development of the mini stadium would open a new chapter of sports development in the area and serve as a veritable tool to engage Edo youths in sporting activities.
