 Horoya of Guinea’s Nigerian striker Bolaji Sarkin has admitted he has been left frustrated after his team’s brilliant season was halted prematurely by the outbreak of the coronavirus. The Guinean Professional Football League recently  declared a premature end to their soccer season in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak with no winner declared. “The COVID-19 pandemic affected us so much because we could have been  crowned champions of Guinea and probably wins the  FA Cup of Guinea,” Sarkin said.”It is not easy to stay at home now that the league has been cancelled but we have to obey the rules and regulations.”  Sarkin moved  to the Guinean champions from Rivers United in 2018 and was instrumental in the Conakry-based side brilliant run at the CAF Confederation Cup, beating Nigeria’s Enyimba of Aba in the quarterfinals before the coronavirus outbreak. The 27 year-old who is currently in his final year at the 16-time Guinea champions, hinted he would be review his options when the lockdown has eased.
