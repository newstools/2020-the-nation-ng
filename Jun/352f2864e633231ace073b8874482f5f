The organised private sector Coalition Against COVID-19, has begun a grassroots awareness campaign to help forestall spread of the novel Coronavirus disease to rural communities in Lagos, Rivers and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. The campaign is to boost government’s efforts in the fight against community spread of the  pandemic . It would be through inter-personal and sustained enlightenment campaign that will help to educate the people in communities on the recommended hygiene protocols . The pilot phase of the campaign in local government areas across Lagos, Rivers and Abuja will address the fragmented understanding in more remote areas of how the disease spreads in community and how to prevent it. Speaking at the kick-off on Thursday, CACOVID-19 Communications coordinator, Tony Chiejina said: “The realisation that our communications efforts so far have not successfully reached our semi-urban and rural communities, triggered the CACOVID grassroots awareness and mobilisation campaign to directly engage and address all of the misconceptions about COVID-19 and its transmission, as well as to encourage immediate adoption of safe personal hygiene practices.” He noted that the grassroots awareness and mobilisation campaign is starting at an auspicious time when the Federal Government is re-opening the economy. It is especially important at this time to reinforce basic information in order to forestall the possibility of more community outbreak.
