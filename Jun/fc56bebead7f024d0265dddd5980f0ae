The Presidential Task Force has declared that rail transport will resume shortly after domestic flight restarts operation. The rail transport was suspended following the outbreak of the coronavirus in the country. Speaking on Monday in Abuja at the daily briefing by members of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, the National Coordinator, Sani Aliyu, said the rail transport would also begin as soon as the ban on interstate travel is lifted. Aliyu said the Task Force would work with the transportation ministry to ensure that the Nigerian Railway Corporation put measures in place to observe all its directives.
