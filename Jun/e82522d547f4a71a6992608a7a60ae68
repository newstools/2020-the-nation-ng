There was a mild drama at an Ilorin Magistrate Court, Kwara on Wednesday as father of the allegedly gang raped 17-year-old teenager ran away with his daughter. The father was said to have brought the girl to court so that she could testify against her cousin, Omotosho Yahaya, and two others who allegedly conspired to abuse her sexually. Meanwhile, Police First Information Report (FIR) revealed that the first defendant, (Yahaya) allegedly lured her cousin to his friend’s house; Mustapha Ridwan and Mustapha Ahmed where they committed the crime. To the amazement of many, the victim’s father suddenly ran out of court and jumped on a standby motorcycle with his daughter and zoomed off. Frantic efforts made by the security operatives who immediately swung into action and chased the duo could not yield any success as they could not be traced. The Director of Child, Ministry of Women Affairs, Mariam Yusuf, who was watching with the members of the International Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA), told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) after the court session that father and daughter would surely be arrested before the next adjourned date. “The rape case was reported in our office yesterday and we joined them in court today, but, when we interrogated the victim, we suspected she had been intimidated and threatened to turn the story around. She said she was not actually raped but molested, that in a bid to revenge the assault, she lied against the culprits.
When the hearing commenced, the culprits’ lawyer applied for bail but it refused. Surprisingly, when the Magistrate wanted to give ruling, the girl jumped up and ran away with her father. “The action established the fact that she was raped but doesn’t want to tell the truth. “FIDA has taken it up; the father will be arrested and definitely, he will be able to produce the victim,’’ she said. Magistrate Afusat Alege, in his ruling, adjourned the matter to June 29. (NAN)
