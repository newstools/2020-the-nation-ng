Anambra State has established mobile courts to try offenders wearing face masks improperly, as one of the measures to combat coronavirus pandemic. Also, such offenders are liable to pay N10,000 or assigned any community service work. These were contained in a statement issued on Thursday in Awka, by the Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, Mr. C. Don Adinuba. The government said the measure was necessary, as the residents had decided to be wearing face masks either on their chins or jaws. “Consequently, the government is establishing mobile courts in different parts of the state to try those who contravene the new law on COVID-19 like individuals who do not wear face coverings or do not wear them properly. “The punishments include payment of up to N10,000 fine and  performance of community service,” the statement.
