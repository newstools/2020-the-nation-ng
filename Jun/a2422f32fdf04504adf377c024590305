 ABIA State Governor Okezie Ikpeazu, his wife, Nkechi, their children and other members of the family have tested negative to COVID -19, following the release of results of their samples taken on Saturday. A statement personally signed by Ikpeazu yesterday reads: “Leading this battle from the front as your governor, I and all members of the first family subjected ourselves to COVID-19 tests on Saturday, 30th May, 2020 and the results came out negative today. “Unfortunately, results of two of my aides, who also subjected themselves to COVID-19 tests were positive while others turned in negative results. We are confident that within days, the currently asymptomatic positive patients who are now isolated will be successfully nursed back to good health, with God on our side. “The new phase of the fight against COVID-19 in Abia will require that the state embark on massive tests of citizens to achieve at least 10% coverage of our population at the initial stage of the exercise. “To this end, the state epidemiologist has been directed to work out modalities for case searches using sample population size of between 30 to 250 persons, in some densely populated LGAs of the state.”
