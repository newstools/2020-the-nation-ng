Civil rights groups have condemned continued harassment of evictees from Tarkwa Bay and eviction threats on residents of other Island communities in Lagos. The groups under the auspices of The Nigerian Slum/Informal Settlement Federation (Federation) and Justice & Empowerment Initiatives –Nigeria (JEI), stated that “forced evictions cause mass homelessness, loss of livelihood, separation of families, and interruption of education, physical and mental health consequences and death”. They called for dialogue, resettlement and compensation for those already evicted for their losses.
