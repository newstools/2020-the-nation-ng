 GUNMEN have raided 12 communities in Shiroro Local Government Area of Niger State, killing one police inspector and a corporal. The policemen were killed on Friday in Erena community, where they reportedly tried to protect engineers working at Shiroro Hydro Electricity Dam, The Nation gathered. A source said the policemen were outnumbered and outgunned by the bandits. Co-convener of Concerned Shiroro Youths, Sani Abubakar Yusuf Kokki told The Nation that the villagers fled into the bush to escape the gunmen. “Sacking villages at will by criminals who have become our regular visitors have been a recurring decimal and unfortunately, these repeated attacks have been happening without the slightest resistance, confrontation or even counterattack from the authorities,” he said. Kokki said the gunmen rustled many herds of cattle and carted away farm produce stored by the people. Police spokesman Wasiu Abiodun said two policemen were missing after an encounter with some armed bandits in Shiroro local government area, adding that there is no certainty that they are dead. He said that a search party had been dispatched to the village with a view to rescuing the two missing officers, adding that police were on the trail of the assailants.
