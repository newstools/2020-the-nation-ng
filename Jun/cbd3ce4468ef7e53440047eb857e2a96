Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand  has rapped Super Eagles defender Wilfred Ndidi over  the error that led to the solitary goal conceded by  Leicester City in their 1-0 loss to Chelsea  in the FA Cup on Sunday. Ferdinand said the  Nigeria international could have done better in the encounter and probably prevented Rose  Barkley’s goal. “The gap between the centre-backs starts to develop. When that happens, when that big gap comes, the big job is for Ndidi, who has had great reviews for how he’s played over the years, and rightly so,” Ferdinand told BT Sport. “Once you see the gap between the centre-backs when the ball’s wide, his job is to drop in, drop in here and be that guard in there. If you keep your eye on Ndidi here and look how many times he looks over his shoulder to see where Barkley is. “One look, two looks – when he looks there – he has to drop in there and cover the run from Barkley. He knows he can get in behind Ndidi because he’s not looking.
