Pan African financial institution, United Bank for Africa (UBA) Plc’s Mobile Banking app has received commendation. Former Minister of Aviation, Mr. Osita Chidoka, on his social media handles, gave kudos to the bank for introducing interactive features to aid banking, and allowing customers to perform transactions from their mobile phones. Chidoka, also a former Corps Marshal and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), pointed out that the bank put into play its experience as an institution with several decades of operations as well as modern technology to come up with a revamped app worthy of emulation. He said: “UBA surprised me with a massive improvement on their app. I used to consider them the sleeping giant of Nigerian banking. I thought they had great brand equity and name recognition. ‘’UBA combined the savvy feel of a new generation bank with the history of a legacy bank. As I opened their mobile app, I couldn’t help but give them a high five. The app is beautiful, user interface is great, navigation is seamless and the need to go to a branch is reduced for small users like us.”
