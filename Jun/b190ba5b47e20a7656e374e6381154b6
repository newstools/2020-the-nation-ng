The COVID-19 mobile screening team assembled by Edo Governor Godwin Obaseki has protested non-payment of allowances for over three months in Benin City. The protest, which took place at the hospital management near the Edo Assembly complex before it spilled out onto the streets, was attended by all members of the screening team. They denounced the Obaseki-administration for halting the exercise abruptly and abandoning them after succeeding in “using them”. They alleged the Governor, seeking political reprieve and aiming to block the direct primaries of the All Progressives Congress(APC), charged the screening team with the task of declaring huge numbers of COVID-19 patients to support the narrative of a surge and set the stage for the gazette he passed banning gatherings. The protesters accused Obaseki of abandoning them and halting the programme after securing the People’s Democratic Party(PDP) ticket to seek reelection.
