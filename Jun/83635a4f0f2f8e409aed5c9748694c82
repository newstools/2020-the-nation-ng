 A crack has emerged among members of the just dissolved National Working Committee (NWC) of the ruling All Progressives Congress(APC) as the immediate past National Publicity Secretary, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu on Friday drummed support for the Governor Mala Buni- led Caretaker committee of the party. He also endorsed the steps taken by President Muhammadu Buhari at Thursday’s National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting of the party in solving the protracted crisis, which has polarised the party. In a statement shortly after the NEC, 18 members of the dissolved NWC reiterated its position that Giadom had no authority whatsoever to convene the NEC meeting. But on Friday, Issa-Onilu said he reflected on the events of the past few days and the outcome of Thursday’s NEC meeting adding that “as a party man, I declare my support for the actions taken by Mr. President”. He observed the party was ominously hanging on a cliff and as expected “something had to give way because the APC could not have continued along that obvious path of destruction”. The Kwara -born politician, who said he was speaking for himself and not the dissolved NWC, called on every member of the party to rally round the Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee led by Governor Mai Mala Buni as it embarks on the process of rebuilding our party to the height we all desire. “Ours must be a party that is strong and truly progressive; one that can provide our government the support it requires to deliver more dividends of democracy. “We all have the obligation to subordinate our individual interests to the collective interests of our government and country. “The task of preserving President Muhammadu Buhari’s unprecedented legacies is not negotiable,” he concluded.
