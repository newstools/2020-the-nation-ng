Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr described the performance of some of his wards at the restart of the Spanish La Liga as very encouraging following the super showing of Samuel Chukwueze for Villarreal. Chukwueze  on Saturday came on as a second half substitute in the Yellow Submarines’  1-0  away win against Celta Vigo to earn plaudits from far and near. Villarreal coach Javier Calleja described his side win as ‘complete performance’  adding  both  Chukwueze and Bacca who respectively replaced  Gerard Moreno  and Cazorla did a Yeoman’s job to earn the team  a well-deserved win. “We put in a complete performance, from the start to the end; we could have scored in the first half,” the 42-year-old former Spain international told the club website. “We keep on mentioning the importance of the whole squad, those who came off the bench knew what the game needed. The hard work by everyone was extraordinary.” Speaking in the same vein, German coach Rohr described Villarreal’s victory as a good omen  in their chase for continental  ticket. “ We are happy with the restart of the leagues in Italy  and Spain ,” Rohr who will be 67 on June 28 told NationSport yesterday.“ Good  victory for Chukwueze’s Villareal.” Elsewhere, the Super Eagles  and Leganes defensive pair of Kenneth Omeruo and  Chidozie Awaziem lost 2-1 away to  Real Valladolid with the latter’s  error contributed to the opening goal in the opening minutes. Equally Super Eagles midfielder Oghenekaro Etebo was also on the losing side as Getafe were handed 2-1  home defeat  by Valladolid to the consternation of Rohr. “ It was unfortunate for Etebo with Getafe ; same for Awaziem and Omeruo with Leganes,” rued Rohr.
