 THE State High Court sitting in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, has sentenced three persons to death by hanging for killing a former Niger Delta militant leader, Soboma George and a groundnut seller, Joy John-Ejims. The court ruled that Dougbra Ogbe, Emmanuel Gladstone and Bere Matthew, were guilty of conspiracy and murder and condemned them. Justice George Omereji, who delivered the judgment, directed that the convicts be hanged by their necks till they were confirmed dead. Also, a federal high court in the state capital yesterday remanded Belema Abibo, a banker, for alleged N100 million fraud. Abbibo, the Managing Director of a microfinance bank, allegedly duped one Olusegun Akingbesoye  after luring him to deposit N100m in the bank’s fixed deposit account.
