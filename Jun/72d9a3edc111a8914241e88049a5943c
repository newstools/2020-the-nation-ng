Former Labour Party governorship candidate in Kwara State, Comrade Issa Aremu, has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to postpone the Edo and Ondo gubernatorial elections following the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. Speaking in Kaduna, he said considering the huge spike in the number of COVID-19 cases and rising deaths across the country, it would be imperative for INEC to postpone the elections, as only those who are alive can vote and be voted for. Aremu said: “The death of Oyo State former governor Isiaka Ajimobi, who died of complications arising from COVID-19 pandemic, and the figures of fatalities reeled out daily by the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 showed that the disease is real and is killing Nigerians. There are enough reasons for INEC to consider the spike in the number of cases and fatalities across the country and postpone the elections in Edo and Ondo states.”
