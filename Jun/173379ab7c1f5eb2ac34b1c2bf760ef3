 A 20-year old man was on Saturday nabbed by the police following his failed attempt to kidnap a two-year-old baby on Aba road, Sabon Gari, Kano, Kano state. The suspect was said to have been rescued by the police from the hands of an angry mob, which wanted to lynch him. The man, name withheld, according to sources, sneaked into a one-storey building and successfully kidnapped the child but was apprehended downstairs by neigbours, who saw him attempting to escape with the childÂ  from the premises.  Immediately an alarm was raised, neighbors gathered at the scene and attempted to lynch the suspected kidnapper. As at the time of filing this report, the suspected kidnapper was said to have been whisked away by security operatives to the Nomansland Police station for further interrogation. However, several attempts to contact the Kano Police Command PPRO, DSP Abdullah Haruna Kiyawa for confirmation failed, as he did not pick his call.
