It was 90 minutes of agony for Super Eagles left back Jamilu Collins and his Paderborn teammates as they were handed a 6-1 demolition in the up and running Bundesliga Sunday. Visiting Borussia Dortmund can best be described as invaders as they ensured the homers did not enjoy a tea party. England international and Dortmund winger Jadon Sancho left no one in doubt that he has recovered fully from injury as he grabbed a hat-trick in the encounter. Although Collins and his teammates fought hard to keep the visitors in check, they however appeared to remove leg from the throttle after 50 minutes as the goal feast began four minutes later with the opener from Belgian Thorgan Hazard. Sancho was on target in the 57th, 74th and 91st minutes respectively. The only consolation goal for drowning Paderborn came in the 72nd minute was via a penalty converted by homeboy Uwe Hünemeier. As if the defeat was not enough headache the Nigeria international equally saw yellow in the 60th minute, thus ruling him out of the next match against RB Leipzig on Saturday. Returnee Sancho, who apparently has been following the worldwide condemnation of brutal killing of black American George Floyd, celebrated his hat-trick by joining the call for justice for the deceased who was shown in a viral video pinned down with the knee by a white police officer. Sancho revealed a T-shirt bearing the message “Justice for George Floyd” There is no doubt that Paderborn will play in the lower division next season after a run that left the team at the bottom of the ladder of the 18-team league with 19 points in 29 matches played. Collins, who first called into Eagles camp in 2018, played two competitive matches for Gernot Rohr tutored side which ended in home and away victory against Libya in the Nations cup qualifiers with the 25 year old coming closing to scoring in the first leg that ended 4-0 in Uyo.
