 RESPONDING to the need to innovate, the National Association of Nigerian Theatre Arts Practitioners (NANTAP) is set to float a digital streaming platform. NANTAP recently signed a partnership agreement with Godwin Noah of 5th Pentagon Studio, to create a website, Mobile App and T V streaming platform, for the purposes of online streaming and broadcast of live and prerecorded dramas, films and other related performances of members and practitioners in Nigeria and across the world. NANTAP signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on May 28, empowering Noah as a Technical Partner to the project, to develop a mobile app and digital streaming platform as well as managing the site and services to ensure that NANTAP offers global streaming industry standard. NANTAP on the other hand will be responsible for the contents that will be broadcast on the platform either through direct production or procuring such content through its network of members and practitioners. NANTAP has already commenced the process of securing all necessary approvals and licenses required for the initiative to run smoothly within the ambit of the law.
