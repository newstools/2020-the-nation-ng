Prime Minister Boris Johnson said yesterday the COVID-19 outbreak in the United Kingdom (UK) was diminishing, as the country’s coronavirus disease alert level was downgraded from four to three. Johnson is expected to announce a reduction in the two-metre social distancing rule and plans for the reopening of businesses today, as part of efforts to restart Britain’s economy amid the pandemic. Johnson, will also today, update Parliament on the next stage of lockdown easing and whether pubs, restaurants, hotels could reopen in UK from July 4. The easing of restrictions on July 4 marks the start of “phase three” when some hospitality businesses can reopen. According the government’s guidance, alert level three means the disease is still in general circulation, although the risk of high or exponential transmission has diminished. In turn, the World Health Organisation recommends a social distance of no less than 1 metre. “The United Kingdom registered 43 COVID-19 deaths on Sunday, well below the previous four days, when there were over 120 fatalities per day,” the daily update from the Department of Health and Social Care showed.
