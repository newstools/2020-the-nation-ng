Members of the Ondo State House of Assembly and political appointees yesterday boosted Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredeolu’s re-election aspiration. The lawmakers bought the governor’s forms for the Expression of Interest and Nomination for the All Progressives Congress (APC) ticket for the October governorship poll in the Sunshine State. The lawmakers, elected under the platform of the ruling APC in the House raised N2.5 million for the Nomination Form. The N20 million for the Expression of Interest Form was raised by all political appointees. Speaking to reporters at party’s Abuja National Secretariat, the groups said that their action was informed by the need for continuity. Admitting the party leadership’s authority over the mode of primary for the emergency of the party’s flag bearer, the groups said that party stakeholders in the state have decided on an indirect mode of primaries to nominate the party’s candidate.
