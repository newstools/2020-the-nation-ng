Anthony Joshua vs Kubrat Pulev could take place under dinner show condition with elevated prices, according to Top Rank boss Bob Arum. Firstly, speaking as talks continue to find a way around the current coronavirus social distancing measures, Arum is hoping to find a way to do the show in the UK. Alongside Matchroom promoter Eddie Hearn, Arum is looking into ways to have a crowd present for the IBF mandatory encounter. Something like the recent shows laid on by Hearn in Monaco for the Principality. Targeting big-money clients and charging thousands to be in attendance, Joshua vs Pulev may well be the hottest and most lucrative card of the year.  “Eddie told me about the possibility of doing it at the Royal Albert Hall with 1,000 people,” Arum told Sky Sports. Joshua is big business in the UK. He has plenty of celebrity friends. Punters who would be more than willing to pay tens of thousands of pounds for the privilege of being there. As measures continue to be taken in order to keep the fight on British soil, opponent Pulev is working away in a bid to snatch away the titles – even in the UK. “Kubrat is getting ready for him,” manager Ivalyo Gotsev also told Sky Sports. “The longer it takes, the bigger punishment; Kubrat is in beast mode. He is training. He is preparing with one focus, one thing in mind – AJ.”
