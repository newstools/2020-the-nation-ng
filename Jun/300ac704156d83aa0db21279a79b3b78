Nuno Espirito Santo backed Wolves to step up their bid to qualify for the Champions League after Leander Dendoncker sealed a 1-0 win at Aston Villa that lifted them into fifth place in the Premier League on Saturday. Nuno’s side made it three successive victories since the Premier League restart thanks to Dendoncker’s clinical finish in the second half. Wolves have yet to concede a goal following the coronavirus hiatus and are now just two points behind fourth-placed Chelsea and three ahead of sixth-placed Manchester United. Both Chelsea and United have a game in hand on Wolves due to their FA Cup involvement this weekend.
