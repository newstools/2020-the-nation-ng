Babcock University has put together a team of researchers to find a cure to the raging coronavirus pandemic. President/Vice Chancellor of the university, Prof. Ademola Tayo said in an interview featured in JAMB Bulletin that the institution’s public health and agriculture faculties were seeking funding for the research “Some of our faculties in the departments of Public Health and Agriculture Who are currently researching on COVID-19 have submitted research proposals on COVID-19 to the Nigerian Institute of Animal Science for sponsorship. We are waiting for their response. “We also do hope that private universities will be eligible for the Federal Government’s funding for research on COVID-19 vaccine so we could benefit from it,” he said. Tayo praised the leadership of the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) Management under Prof. Is-haq Oloyede for transforming the board. He said the Central Admissions Processing System (CAPS) he introduced had tremendously helped to fine-tune the admissions process in the university. He also praised the Integrated Brochure and Syllabus System (IBASS) which he said provided immense help to candidates. “The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board has been an exceptional regulator of admissions. It is also highly gratifying that the leadership of the Board has been demonstrating unparalleled commitment to excellence. For us, in Babcock University, excellence has no other name than excellence, and we are proud that we share that quality with the JAMB leadership. The relationship and partnership with the Board is mutual, and we hope both parties will sustain it without let or hindrance,” he said.
