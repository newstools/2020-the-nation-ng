 National Chairman of Zenith Labour Party (ZLP), Chief Dan Nwanyanwu, has alleged plots by some political interests to ensure the removal of the Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Mr Ibrahim Magu, from office. Nwanyanwu, who addressed reporters yesterday in Abuja, accused some former governors and others, who are being investigated for corruption by the EFCC as the brains behinds the alleged plot. He said: “Intelligence has reached us that there is an attempt and, in fact, they have gone on to actualise this attempt by putting together hundreds of millions of naira.  “These are former office holders in the country with those that are facing trial. This huge sum of money they have put together is to be used to influence government functionaries and those very close to the President. “Their plot is to ensure that the one who has been driving this anti-corruption fight, in the person of Ibrahim Mustapha Magu, would be removed as quickly as possible. “Some of them are facing trial; some of them would have their trials commenced very soon. But they don’t want it to happen. That has led them into putting heads together and putting funds together, which they use in lobbying.”
