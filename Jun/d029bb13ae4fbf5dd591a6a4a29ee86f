The impeachment threat that hangs over the Oyo State Deputy Governor, Rauf Olaniyan, is far from being over if feelers from the Oyo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the state government are anything to go by. Following the reported intervention of some eminent personalities within and outside the state, the frosty relationship between Olaniyan and his boss, Governor Seyi Makinde, appeared over, but the former may still lose his seat. One of the reasons given for the failure of an earlier impeachment plot is the “good relationship” Deputy Governor enjoys with the leadership of the state assembly and majority of lawmakers. Ironically, this same “good relationship” is making it difficult for some people and interests within the government and party to be comfortable with his continued stay in office. The allegations against him include the fear that he could one day move against the governor, “given his good relationship with the lawmakers.” Sentry learnt of subtle moves within the party and the state assembly to prepare the ground for easing out Olaniyan and replacing him with someone with less political clout and visibility immediately after the Covid-19 crisis. Already, there are allegations that the Deputy Governor is being sidelined in the administration of the state. His supporters are of the opinion that there is a calculated attempt to reduce his visibility ahead of a more sinister plan.
