 FROM President Muhammadu Buhari has come a warning to the bandits terrorising the Northwest: surrender now or face a fatal and disgraceful end. Receiving Governor Aminu Masari of Katsina State at the State House, Abuja, on Thursday, Buhari vowed that no bandit, having committed crimes against the people, would be spared. Bandits have scaled up attacks on villages and residents in many parts of Kaduna, Sokoto, Zamfara and Katsina states in the last few weeks, killing and maiming. The President, according to his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, assured the people of the affected states of renewed efforts by government to secure their lives and property as military operations had been reviewed to effectively root out bandits. Shehu said: “President Buhari warned bandits to surrender their weapons or face ‘disgraceful and violent ends. “The President said more decisive military operations against bandits in Zamfara, Sokoto, Niger, Katsina and Kaduna States will be undertaken. “President Buhari commiserated with Governor Masari over the loss of lives from attacks by bandits, which include District Head of Yantumaki, Alhaji Atiku Maidabino, and APC Chairman in Batsari Local Government Council, Alhaji Abdulhamid Sani Duburawa.”
