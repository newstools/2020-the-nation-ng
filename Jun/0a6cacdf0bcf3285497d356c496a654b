Edo Governor Godwin Obaseki on Wednesday night expressed fear that he might not get justice from the  All Progressives Congress (APC) Edo State Governorship Primary Screening Committee. He said this after two hours of drilling by the Prof. Jonathan Ayuba-led seven-man committee at the party’s National Secretariat in Abuja. Addressing newsmen after the screening, Obaseki said: “The last time I came here, I asked that Oshiomhole recuse himself from the process in the interest of peace and justice. But as a party man, I have had to go through the screening like everybody else. “Since he is the judge and the jury in this matter, I will just wait for the outcome of the screening. I have given them all the information they need; the controversial certificate from the University of Ibadan has been tendered. “Like I said, as a party man I have engine through the screening process but I do not believe that I will get justice because Comrade Adams Oshiomhole is an interested party in the Edo process.” Shedding light on what transpired at the screening session, the embattled aspirant said: “One of the questions that was asked was why I issued  a gazette that will prevent the party from performing direct elections in Edo? That did I not see it as an anti-party activity? I just felt that if we put politics above the lives of the people of Edo State, that we may be missing the point”. Obaseki, who arrived the National Secretariat for screening at 8pm, was in company of Senator Domingo Obende. The governor, reported earlier for the verification exercise hurriedly left after few minutes to attend to some state matters.
