The running mate to the African Democratic Congress (ADC) governorship candidate in Edo State, Mabel Oboh, has boasted that the party will win the September 19 election. Oboh, a renowned Nollywood entertainer, addressing reporters in Benin after emerging as the running mate to Benjamin Akhigbe, noted that Edo women had been neglected over the years. She said if voted into power, the ADC government would drive womenâ€™s cause and give them a sense of belonging. Oboh said women were always relegated to the background in Edo State, adding that they were only used to win elections and denied feeling the impact of the government. She promised to prioritise issues concerning youths, children and the less-privileged. Oboh urged the electorate to vote for the ADC on September 19. Edo Chairman of ADC Christopher Inegbedion enjoined the people to support the party and end hardship in the state.
