 The All Progressives Congress(APC) Governorship aspirant in Edo, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, has reiterated commitment to reconciliation in the party. He praised the other aspirants for their maturity and statesmanship, which he said helped moved the party forward and kept the contest issue-based and respectful. Acknowledging discontent that may exist in some quarters, Ize-Iyamu promised speedy reconciliation of all existing issues and assured party members of a united front as the countdown to the polls officially kicks off. He also promised to reach out to all members of the party, including Governor Godwin Obaseki, who recently defected to the PDP to join in the quest to strengthen the party in the state and ensure that it is victorious at the polls in November. Decrying the charged atmosphere that trailed the tussle for the party’s ticket in the state which, according to him, adversely affected the governance of the state, he called for a return to normalcy, challenging all stakeholders involved in the state’s politics to imbibe the peaceful and responsible conduct displayed by members of the APC while participating in the primaries. Chairman of the Election Committee for the primary, Senator Hope Uzodinma, while presenting Ize-Iyamu as the aspirant, commended the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) led by Commissioner, Dr. Johnson Alalibo Tinikin, the State Police Command, DSS, and the media for their roles in ensuring the smooth conduct of the exercise. He also praised members of the party for their compliance with all health guidelines and peaceful conduct throughout the duration of the voting process. Noting the downpour in the early hours of the day, he expressed respect for the resilience of the members who defied the weather and waited patiently in line, according to social distancing rules, to play their part in choosing the party’s representative.
