 THE popular Oba Market in Benin, the Edo State capital, has been razed. The fire, which burnt almost all the massive market, according to eyewitnesses, started around noon on Monday and raged till 6pm, before it was put out by firefighters. While the actual cause of the fire was not ascertained at press time, it was learnt that there was no electricity when the blaze started, ruling out the possibility of electrical spark. Many of the traders cried uncontrollably over their loss estimated in millions of naira,  pleading with Governor Godwin Obaseki and others to come to their aid. President Muhammadu Buhari has directed a thorough probe of the blaze, saying, “Our thoughts and prayers are with those who lost their shops and wares.” Fire servicemen said they lack water and that their trucks were moribund. Passersby  attacked them fro failing to put out the fire. Assistant Controller, Federal Fire Service in Asaba, the Delta State capital, Samson Karibo, who was in Benin with his men, on a special assignment, assisted in fighting the fire. He said he contacted  firefighters from the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC) Limited, a subsidiary of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), the Airforce, and Edo state fire service but the main work was done by the federal fire service. Governor Obaseki, who visited the market, has set up a committee to probe the fire.
