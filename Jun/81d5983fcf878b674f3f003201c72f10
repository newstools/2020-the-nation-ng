Senator Ned Nwoko is excited at the moment. His young actress wife, Regina Daniels, is heavily pregnant and  will become a mother soon. While there is a reason to throw a party now, the politician will always remember December 8, 2014, as a day life was unfair to him. It’s so easy for everyone to move on as if there was no time Nwoko lost his look-alike son, Tarik Nwoko. But for the lawyer, nothing in this world can heal the wound completely. For any parent, losing a son is hard. It is even more unbearable to lose your first son whom everyone described as your younger version. Born on December 18, 1988, Tarik whose mother was Moroccan died precisely 10 days to his birthday. He was a 22-year-old law student at North Staffordshire University where he reportedly died in his sleep. His dream was to become a lawyer like his father but death had a final say.
