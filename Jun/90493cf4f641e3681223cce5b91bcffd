The Bishop of Ijesa North Anglican Diocesan Headquarters, Oke-Eruru, Ijebu-Jesa, Osun State, Rt.Rev. Dr Issac Oluyamo, has charged the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 to declare national prayer and fasting against the pandemic. Dr Oluyamo made this known after a meeting held on Friday with other clergymen in the area to deliberate on how to adhere to guideline put in place by Osun state government to curb the spread of the virus as the ban was lifted on religious activities. He commended the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 on the role played in rolling out modalities that will forestall the spread of the virus and for considering the opening of religious centres in the country. The bishop implored the PTF to declare national prayer and fasting for divine healing of the country thereby putting an end to the deadly virus as the ban is lifted on religious gatherings. He held that government opening religious gathering should not just be for personal prayer but prayer for the country in all ramification. He said that the economy of the country is greatly affected just like other country and Nigerians should use some period to pray for the country. According to him, the opening of religious gathering is for us to call on God to end the pandemic and restore what we have lost. We should not give chances to the devil in any way but we must unanimously pray for an end to this coronavirus and also adhere to government guidelines to halt the spread of coronavirus.
“I call on the Presidential Task Force to declare national prayer and fasting for the country. So that we should call on God together for him to restore us and bless us more abundantly. Opening of religious gatherings should be first for the growth of the country and not personal interest,” he ended.
