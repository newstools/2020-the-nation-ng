The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) has declared that its orientation camps will reopen when it is very safe, in view of the danger posed by COVID-19 pandemic. Director, Press and Public Relations of the scheme Mrs. Adenike Adeyemi made this known on Thursday in a statement issued in Abuja. “The attention of the management of the scheme has been drawn to an online publication stating that the ‘NYSC is set to reopen orientation camps, lists guidelines’, alluding that the scheme will soon resume orientation programme,” Adeyemi said. She said the scheme placed a very high premium on the lives of corps members, camp officials and other stakeholders, “which was the key reason it suspended 2020 Batch “A” Stream 1 orientation programme in March and shall never act in any way that will compromise their safety”. Adeyemi urged corps members and prospective corps members to glean information concerning the scheme only from NYSC official sources – both the social and mainstream media.
