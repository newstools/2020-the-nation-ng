Dr. Benjamin Akhigbe has emerged the gubernatorial candidate of the African Democratic Congress(ADC) in Edo State. Akhigbe, a foremost medical scientist and grassroots mobiliser, who hails from Esan North Local Government Area of Edo State, clinched the ADC ticket with a wide margin after a keenly contested primary election on Saturday. The National Coordinator, Electoral Matters and INEC Liason, Chief Anayo Arinze, commended the peaceful primary, saying it showed that ADC was on its way to take over governance in Edo. He thanked the Edo youths and women united groups for believing in the ideals of ADC enough to purchase nomination and expression of interest forms for Governor Godwin Obaseki, adding that the governor’s choice of another party was a misguided one that would cost him the seat. “Today, the Edo people have spoken, and have elected Dr. Benjamin Akhigbe, who is loved by all, to run as the ADC governorship candidate in Edo State. They have also endorsed Princess Mabel Okoh as his running mate. This is history in the making in Edo.” Akhigbe thanked the leaders of the party and members in general for the opportunity, saying he would lead ADC to victory. National Chairman of ADC, Chief Ralphs Okey Nwosu, stressed that with this right choice, ADC was set to end godfather politics in Edo State. “We commend Edo Youth and Women United for believing in ADC. We must reclaim Edo for the people of Edo. Congratulations to Dr. Benjamin Akhigbe and Princess Mabel Oboh who Edo people today endorsed as ADC flagbearers,” the chairman stated.
