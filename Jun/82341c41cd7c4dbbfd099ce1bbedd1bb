The Minster of Industry, Trade and Investment,  Adeniyi Aebayo, disclosed at the weekend that the Federal Government will create and save no fewer than five million jobs from its Post-COVID-19 economic recovery plans. According to the minister, plans are underway to save about 1.4 million jobs of Nigerians, with 40 percent of them in female-owned MSMEs and 10 percent in businesses belonging to people with special needs. The minister noted that the move is part of his ministry’s input in playing a leading role in the Federal Government’s delivery of Real Sector interventions of its Economic Sustainability Plan in the wake of the global pandemic. To achieve these, he gave an overview of three programmes as: The MSME Survival Fund, The Guaranteed Off take Stimulus Scheme and the Credit Support to MSMEs and Priority Sector. These interventions will save and create about five million jobs, support continued operations and increase in production capacity in priority sectors and protect MSMEs from the shocks of the COVID-19 pandemic,” he said.
