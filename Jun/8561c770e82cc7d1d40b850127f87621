A Federal High Court sitting in Abuja has struck out a suit filed against Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki. The plaintiffs, in the suit marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/553/2020, accused the governor of engaging in certificate forgery. Listed as plaintiffs in the suit are Edobor Williams, Ugbesia Abudu Godwin and Amedu Dauda Anakhu. They accused Obaseki of forging his Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) certificate in Classical Studies from the University of Ibadan. The plaintiffs contended that the alleged certificate forgery contravenes Section 182(1)(i) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended). They prayed the court to among others, hold that Obaseki is “not qualified to run or seek election to the office of the governor of Edo State” in the coming 2020 governorship election. At the mention of the case yesterday, neither the plaintiffs nor their lawyers were in court.  The defendant too was not represented. Following the development, Justice Anwuli Chiekere struck out the suit.
