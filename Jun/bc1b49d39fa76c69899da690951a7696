 FORMER President Olusegun Obasanjo has warned of imminent post-COVID -19 food crisis in Nigeria and other African countries. He urged governments in the continent to rise up to the challenges ahead. Obasanjo urged Nigerians to take the issue of post-COVID -19 seriously, saying after the novel had ran its full course, it would give way to food crisis in Africa. The elder statesman spoke at his Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL) Lake Pond in Abeokuta, Ogun State, where he kicked off a fish farming project, at the weekend with 50,000 pieces of sub-adult fishes. A week earlier, OOPL had laid-off dozens of workers at the sprawling facility as the COVID – 19 pandemic and the attendant lockdown of Nigeria bites harder on its hospitality business and allied ones. Obasanjo elected to venture into both Catfish and Tilapia species  with initial 50,000 fingerlings,  which were released for acclimatisation and subsequent growth inside the lake pond, located directly opposite the main Library. The ex-President said the idea came from his thinking out of the box.
