The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) on Wednesday accused the Federal Government of paying N168 billion to oil marketers as subsidy despite claiming that there is no provision for it in the 2020 budget. NLC President Ayuba Wabba stated this on Wednesday during a meeting with House of Representatives Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila.  However, a source at the Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning said: “No subsidy payment was made to anyone. It is not captured in the budget.” The source added that the government only “gave out promisory notes not for 2020 but for 2021 to 2022”.
