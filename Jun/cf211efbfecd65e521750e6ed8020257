 The Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries (MFM), has concluded arrangement to transmit its services live on television. This followed the ongoing provision of adequate measures and installation of facilities to ensure successful reopening. The Chairman of the MFM Media Committee, Pastor Oladele Bank-Olemoh, said that the General Overseer Worldwide, Dr. Daniel Olukoya, considered the safety implications of opening the church for service, in view of its crowded services, prayer and deliverance nature, vibrancy and the peculiarity of its worship modes. The international headquarters of MFM, situated at Onike, Yaba in Lagos, hosts no fewer than 15,000 in any of its services.  The MFM urged members to continue to fellowship through the media platforms already provided, which include YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and MFM TV. The ministry reminded members that services have not resumed yet, saying adequate notice will be given before the services resume. To reach more members, Pastor Bank-Olemoh said that the Sunday service will be transmitted from 8am to 9am; Manna Water service on Wednesdays between 5pm and 6pm, while the monthly power-packed Power Must Change Hands programme will be on air from 7am to 8am on the first Saturday of every month on the Lagos Television (LTV).
