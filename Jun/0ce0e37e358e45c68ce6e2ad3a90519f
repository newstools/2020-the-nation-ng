 The former presidential aspirant on the platform of People’s Democratic Party PDP, in 2019 general elections, Stanley Osifo has enjoined the leadership of ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), to step up and salvage the party. Osifo made this call in a telephone conversation with The Nation yesterday in Lagos. Speaking on the Court of Appeal decision that upheld the suspension of the party’s National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, Osifo stressed that the former Edo State governor did not take cognizance of the case instituted in the court to look for what exactly to do about it. Osifo who is also APC chieftain, noted that whatever happens in the party now is an indication that there are elements who are in the party but they are not there to ensure the right things are done.  He emphasized that the current situation in the party behooves on its leadership to look at things holistically and forge ahead as a party. Lending his voice to the happenings in Edo State, the businessman turned politician dispelled the insinuation that the court case that suspended Oshiomhole as part of struggle between the Edo State governor, Godwin Obaseki and the national chairman. The Edo born politician urged the two gladiators in Edo State to broker peace, saying fracas between the national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole and the governor should not be used as bait for confusion in the party.
