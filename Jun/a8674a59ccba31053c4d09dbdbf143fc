The Federal Government has reassured Niger and other parts of its commitment to end banditry and other forms of crime. The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Ambassador Zubairu Dada made this known at the weekend. Dada expressed regret over the observed increased activities of bandits in some states across, including Niger State. He said measures would be intensified in curbing the menace. The Minister listed some of the efforts made by the government to tackle insecurity, including the recent meeting between the President and security chiefs where Buhari told them in clear terms to justify their continuous stay in office by halting the menace. The Minister urged Nigerians to always volunteer relevant information to the security agencies to help them in discharging their responsibilities. Dada also noted the Federal Government efforts in the provision of social amenities to all parts of the country.
