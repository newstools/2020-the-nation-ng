 POLICE in Abuja have arrested a 54-year old man, Chukwudi Odo, narrating how he allegedly lured a 40-year-old Filipino woman, Irene Panas, to Nigeria through Facebook and keeping her incommunicado for months. Odo was said to have extorted and sexually molested the woman. Force spokesman DCP Frank Mba, who paraded Odo alongside other suspects at the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) headquarters in Abuja on Monday, said the woman who flew in from Manila, Philippines to Abuja, came in an apparent unsuccessful search for love. He said the woman, who was held in Enugu State, was successfully rescued by operatives of the State Police Command at Neke-Uno Village, Enugu East local government area, following a tip-off. â€œThe Philippino was rescued six months after she arrived Nigeria from the Philippines in an apparent but unsuccessful search for love.
