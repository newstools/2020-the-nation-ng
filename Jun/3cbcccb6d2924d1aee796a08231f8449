Plans for Anthony Joshua’s fight with Kubrat Pulev at the end of the year will not be threatened by his knee injury, according to Eddie Hearn. Joshua wore a protective brace on his left knee at a Black Lives Matter march on Saturday after feeling a ‘twinge’ while training. But his promoter Hearn confirmed that the injury will not scupper Joshua’s return, despite requiring four weeks’ rest. Hearn said the fight is ‘still planned for probably October or November’, with November more likely owing to the improved chances of securing a big crowd. A spokesman for Joshua added: “Anthony felt a slight twinge in his knee whilst training. The brace is a precautionary measure on the advice of physios. “It will be further checked by his doctors but there is no immediate concern.” Joshua, the IBF, WBA and WBO heavyweight world champion, was initially scheduled to meet his IBF mandatory challenger Pulev on June 20 at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Owing to the situation around the pandemic, subsequent plans were pencilled in for July 25 but the floating plan is now targeting the final quarter of the year.
