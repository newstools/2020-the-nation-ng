Activist lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN) has requested a coroner’s investigation into the death of an Ibadan artisan Olaoluwa Bolarinwa, 41, in the custody of the Inspector General of Police’ (IG) Special Tactical Squad (STS), Ayobo, Lagos. He made the request yesterday in a letter addressed to the Chief Coroner, High Court of Lagos State and signed on behalf of his chambers by Taiwo Olawanle. The Nation had reported outcry by Bolarinwa’s family following his  controversial death in STS custody about six weeks after his alleged arrest by proxy. The deceased, according to his family, was picked up by the police from his residence in Ibadan on the grounds that they needed him to get his friend alleged to be an armed robber only to be smuggled into STS where he was allegedly tortured to death. In the letter to the Chief Coroner, Falana said the family instructed the chamber to report Bolarinwa’s death under controversial circumstances. “Since the family heard of the death, they have requested the head of the IGP Tactical Squad located at Ayobo, Lagos State to release the body for an autopsy but all entreaties fell on deaf ear. “In view of the foregoing, we have the instructions of our clients to humbly request Your Lordship to conduct an inquest into the circumstances surrounding the sudden death of the said Mr. Olaoluwa Bolarinwa,” the letter said.
