Former Oyo Senator Abiola Ajimobi died on Thursday after suspected COVID-19 complications. Tributes are pouring the late’s politician’s antecedents. While he was Governor, he was well-known with three of these nicknames. 1. Constituted Authority You guessed right! That is indisputably the most popular nickname of the late politician. In reminiscence, Ajimobi had expressly pronounced himself ‘constituted authority’ in 2017 whilst students of the Oyo/Osun states’ jointly-owned Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH), Ogbomosho protested at Oyo Secretariat over the elongated lockdown of their institution as a result of nonpayment of lecturers. The former governor described himself the ‘constituted authority’ in accordance with the 1999 constitution although that infuriated the youths the more, a reason the name sticks till date. 2. ‘Pe egun re’ 1 Roughly translated, the Yoruba expressions means ‘Number One jinx-breaker’ or ‘record breaker’ In the history of Oyo state, no politician had served as governor for two terms apart from Ajimobi. Christopher Alao-Akala, a close rival, was only a deputy governor under Chief Rashidi Ladoja and later served out the joint tenure after his boss was impeached. He went on to serve a full tenure of four years as governor. In the case of Ajimobi, he was elected governor on two occassions – in 2011 and 2015. This was found groundbreaking as Ibadan, the political headquarters and capital of the state in the agelong belief of never following one person more than once. It was Ajimobi that broke the jinx. 3. The Builder In this political circle, supporters also excite him with eulogy as the builder of Modern Oyo. Indeed, Oyo rose to be an enviable economic hub during the eight years Ajimobi served, attracting foreign investors and giving facelift to the ancient state.
