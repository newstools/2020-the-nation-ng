Very limited number of intending pilgrims will be allowed to participate in this year’s hajj, Saudi Arabia announced yesterday. The hajj will hold next month. A statement by Saudi’s Ministry of Hajj and Umrah said pilgrims will be from nationalities already in Saudi Arabia. The decision, the ministry said, was “in light of the continuation of the pandemic and the risks of Coronavirus spreading in crowded spaces and large gatherings.” Saudi Arabia has one of the highest rates of COVID-19 in the Middle East, with more than 157,000 confirmed cases and over 1,267 deaths. The statement reads: “A very limited number of pilgrims from various nationalities who already reside in Saudi Arabia, would be able to perform it. “This decision is taken to ensure Hajj is performed in a safe manner from a public health perspective while observing all preventative measures and the necessary social distancing protocols.” The ministry said Saudi Arabia’s top priority was to always enable Muslim pilgrims perform Hajj and Umrah safely and securely. About 2.5 million pilgrims performed Hajj last year.
