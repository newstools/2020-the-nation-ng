Special Adviser on Media and Publicity to President Muhammadu Buhari, Femi Adesina, has described the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as an association of liars. He said lying is natural to the opposition party in his weekly piece titled “A ‘Good Setback’ by 60 years” on Friday. Adesina was reacting to PDP spokesman, Kola Ologbodiyan’s claim that Buhari has “taken our country 60 years backward,” while assessing the administration’s fifth year in power. He said: “When the PDP lies, it speaks its mother tongue, its natural language, “for he is a liar and father of all lies.” The party has become willfully blind and deaf to all progress going on in the country.” The presidential aide said rather than take Nigeria backward, Buhari has actually positioned the country for progress on many fronts. He claimed “a minimum of 600 roads projects going on in different parts of the country today,” arguing the President has taken on projects abandoned by previous administrations. Some of these, according to Adesina, include the 38km Bodo-Bonny road, which will be the first link road to Bonny Island. He also mentioned interventions in rail projects, agriculture and ongoing work on the Second Niger Bridge as evidence that Buhari remained determined to change the nation.
