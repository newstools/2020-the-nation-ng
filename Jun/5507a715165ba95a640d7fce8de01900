The Federal Government has said it will soon announce the bidding process for firms interested in the management of its highways. This followed the government’s decision to concession 10 of its highways. Works and Housing Minister Babatunde Fashola announced this on Thursday in Abuja during a webinar for stakeholders’ consultation on highway development management. He assured that the process will be conducted in a transparent manner “that allows the most effective bids to compete vigorously in a process that delivers service to Nigerians”.
