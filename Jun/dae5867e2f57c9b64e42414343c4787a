 The Abuja branch of the Nigerian Bar Association(NBA) has advocated collaboration by relevant agencies to address rising cases rape, sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV). It is ready to work with the National Human rights Commission (NHRC), National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) and the Police. The branch’s Vice-Chairman, Chioma Onyenucheya-Uko, said this on Tuesday during a solidarity visit to the Inspector General of Police. She was accompanied by NHRC Executive Secretary Tony Ojukwu and the Director-General of NAPTIP, Julie Okah-Donli. Onyenucheya-Uko said: “We all need to do our bit to fight against rape and SGBV, because when it affects one it affects us all. “To groom a wholesome society, in which each of us can thrive in our elements, we need to stamp out every form of violence, every form of crime and everything that reduces the dignity of a person.”  She reiterated that the collaboration with the agencies “is a strong statement to say that all hands are on deck and nothing will go un-turned towards pursuing this cause”. Onyenucheya-Uko said the NBA would continue to do all within its powers to help stamp out rape and SGBV in Nigeria. “We are watching and taking up actions and whoever sees or hears or suffers any of these violations should not hesitate to speak to the NBA. “We are ready and we are willing to do whatever we can to help the citizens get their due rights respected and protected,” Onyenucheya-Uko said. Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) Frank Mba, who represented the IGP, said the Police “is ready to partner with every positive-minded Nigerian to do whatever is legally permissible, to do whatever is administratively and operationally possible to ensure that we reduce rape and other forms of sexual violence to their barest minimum”. He urged citizens to take a cue from what the NBA and other organisations are doing to break the conspiracy of silence.
