Founder of Sotitobire Praising Chapel, Prophet Babatunde Alfa, has opened defence in his ongoing trial over the disappearance of a one -year- old Gold Kolawole. Gold was kept at the children section of his church by his parents last year and was never found again. Prophet Alfa told an Ondo High Court that he would call 20 witnesses, including his wife, Bisola Counsel to Prophet Alfa, Olusola Oke, told the court the 20 witnesses would also testify for six other defendants. Bisola, who appeared as first defence witness, said her husband showed concern and took appropriate action to find the missing boy before his arrest by the DSS. During cross examination by the lead Prosecutor and Commissioner for Justice Adekola Olawoye, Mrs Alfa said her husband never told her he suspected anybody of complicity in the case but a statement by the Prophet tendered as exhibit said he suspected the 4th defendant, Grace Ogunjobi of a fowl play in the incident. A pastor in the church, Oluwasiji Olaniyi, said they spent all night praying in the church the day the baby got missing. He informed the court Alfa accused Gold’s father of knowing the whereabouts of his son but the Gold’s mother threatened to stab him if he does not produce the toddler. Alfa and his co- defendants are standing trial on a three count charge to include conspiracy to aid and abet Kidnapping, Kidnapping and destroying evidence. The case was adjourned to Monday for continuation of defence.
