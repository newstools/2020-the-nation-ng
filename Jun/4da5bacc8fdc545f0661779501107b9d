A governorship aspirant of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ondo State, Hon Isaac Kekemeke, has said that he was not bothered about alleged illegal registration of persons into the party ahead of party primaries scheduled for July. Kekemeke, who was a former Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, said experience is what matters in party primaries. Speaking with newsmen in Akure, Kekemeke noted that as a former state chairman of the APC, he knew the final list of party members would be submitted by the National Chairman and Organising Secretary at the national level. Kekemeke stated he has reminded the large membership of the Lekeleke Movement that they have chosen not to lie, engage in rituals or anything that is unholy, unlawful or that challenges their integrity because of what they are selling. According to him: “That is part of the whole politics where people do all kinds of things to get electoral advantage. I was chairman of the party, I know the last the time we do an all-inclusive and unbiased registration was 2014. This is captured in the party’s database. “Ever since, what we have had is in house registration by all manners of interest groups. I believe that our national headquarters led by Oshiomhole has capacity to do the right thing. Our campaign team is not involve in the illegal registration and we have not been mentioned. “I am not worried about illegal registration because I have served as Chairman of the party and supervised the conduct of a gubernatorial primary”.
