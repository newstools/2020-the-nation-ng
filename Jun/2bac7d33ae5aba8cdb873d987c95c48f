Arguably the pick of this weekend’s Bundesliga action will take place at the BayArena today as top-four hopefuls Bayer Leverkusen welcome league leaders Bayern Munich. Leverkusen are currently fifth in the table, level on points with fourth-placed Borussia Monchengladbach, while champions Bayern are seven points clear of second-placed Borussia Dortmund at the summit. Leverkusen have won three of their four matches since the Bundesliga resumed in the middle of May, including an important 1-0 victory away to Freiburg in their last fixture on May 29. Peter Bosz’s side put seven goals past Werder Bremen and Borussia Monchengladbach in successive matches last month, but they were brought crashing back down to earth at home to Wolfsburg on May 26, suffering a 4-1 reverse as their seven-game unbeaten run ended in surprise fashion. Leverkusen, as mentioned, are level on points with the side directly above them, while they sit just two points off third-placed RB Leipzig and four behind second-placed Dortmund. It is incredibly difficult to imagine a scenario where Die Werkself challenge for the title, but a victory over Bayern today  would give them real hope in the fight for second position. There will once again be eyes on Kai Havertz with the 20-year-old scoring six times in his last four Bundesliga appearances, and it has been suggested that Bayern could hold talks with Leverkusen ahead of the match over a potential summer deal.
