 THE University of Ibadan on Wednesday confirmed that Governor Godwin Obaseki graduated from the institution. The university, in a statement by its Registrar, Mrs Olubunmi Faluyi, said Obaseki studied Classics. According to the statement, the governor gained admission in 1976 and graduated in 1979 with a Second Class Honours (Lower Division). “Records of his admission and graduation are intact in the archives of the university,” the statement added. The university made the clarification following the allegation that the three credits scored in the West African School Certificate Examination could not have qualified the governor for admission into the institution. Also on Wednesday, the vice-chairman of Ovia Northeast Local Government Council, Mrs. Maureen Ekharagbon resigned. Ekharagbon, in her June 10 resignation letter, gave administrative, governance and political matters as her reasons for throwing in the towel. The council boss resigned due to the realignment of forces ahead of the shadow poll and the September 19 governorship election. The letter read in part: “I tender my resignation, based on administrative, political and governance grounds, as politics and governance are inextricably connected. “I want to use this opportunity to thank Governor Obaseki for the opportunity to serve and also the Chairman of the Council, Mr. Scott Ogbemudia. “I am grateful to the people of Ovia Northeast LGA of Edo State and the leadership of the APC, on which platform I was elected.”
