Erstwhile APC National Deputy Secretary, Victor Giadom, left the NEC meeting, which he summoned as national acting chairman in dramatic fashion on Thursday. The Rivers State-born politician was excused out of the Aso Villa venue, following the dissolution of the National Working Committee (NWC). After the dissolution, Gaidom attempted to speak, but sources at meeting said House of Representatives Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila, objected, saying that he had ceased to be a NEC member, owing to the NWC dissolution. The point of order was sustained and Giadom left the hall.
