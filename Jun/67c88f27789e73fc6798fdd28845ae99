SPAIN’S Laliga delegate in Nigeria Guillermo Perez believes Nigeria is a key partner in the football organisation’s international development agenda and hopes its relationship with the women league will foster growth in the future. He was speaking at a series of online masterclass sessions organised for coaches of the Nigerian Women Football League (NWFL) as part of LaLiga’s continued global commitment to women’s football. These sessions consist of some adapted and selected content that is part of a new comprehensive programme developed by LaLiga, called “LaLiga Women’s Football Coaching Methodology”. The original programme consists of a series of in-person courses organised into different levels of complexity, from the grassroots to the elite, focused on the specialities of women’s football.  “At LaLiga, we are extremely happy about the success of this first edition of the online masterclasses. NWFL is one of our key partners in Nigeria and, activating the MoU between both entities, was one of our priorities for this season,” Guillermo Perez said. “The fact that Nigeria was the first country in which we’ve trained through this new format and methodology, proves how important Nigeria is in LaLiga’s international development and how committed we are to the local football development. We hope this will be the first activation of many more to come with NWFL.” Also speaking at the session, Aisha Falode, NWFL Chairperson said the NWFL and LaLiga have identified common grounds in their goals and vision for the future.
