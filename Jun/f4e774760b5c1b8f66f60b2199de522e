Kwara State Government on Wednesday fumigation of mosques or churches as well as mandatory use of thermometers are not preconditions for reopening of worship centres. It said people of all ages can go worship once they abide by the safety protocols of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). The clarifications came at a meeting the government held with the Ad-hoc Committee of the Kwara State Council of Ulamah (set up by the Emir of Ilorin) in Ilorin, the state capital, ahead of the official reopening of Jumat services across the state. The meeting was presided over by Deputy Governor Kayode Alabi, who was flanked by other top government officials. The meeting reiterated that mosques and churches can open and may be attended by persons of all ages and genders but with strict adherence to all safety protocols, such as the use of face masks, physical distancing among worshipers, and washing of hands, among others. Special Adviser to the Governor on Health Matters Prof Wale Sulaiman, who spoke on behalf of the government, said the country was not out of the woods yet given ongoing reports of COVID-19 cases, hence government’s insistence on strict adherence to safety protocols to protect the citizens. Governor AbdulRaman AbdulRazaq has, however, ordered the immediate release of seized motorcycles and other items seized during the lockdown occasioned by the coronavirus pandemic in the state to their owners. Abdulrazaq’s spokesperson Rafiu Ajakaye, in a statement, said the directive to release the seized items was made in order not to worsen socio-economic hardships that the coronavirus pandemic has already imposed at global, national, state, and individual levels. The statement also said that football viewing centres are not allowed to open yet, because such facilities could be a dangerous window for widespread transmission of the Coronavirus among viewers.
