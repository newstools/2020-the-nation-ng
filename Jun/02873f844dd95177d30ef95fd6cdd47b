Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde has said the need to follow bureaucratic processes has been delaying the decision to drag key leaders in the administration of former governor Abiola Ajimobi before the state anti-corruption agency. He spoke at the weekend through his Chief Press Secretary, Taiwo Adisa, while featuring on Southwest Political Circuit, a political interview programme on an Ibadan-based radio station, Fresh F.M. 105.9. Governor Makinde established the Oyo State Economic and Financial Crimes Commission within his first six months in office to send signals to government officials about his seriousness to run a corruption-free government. But the agency is yet to get members of the board to manage it. In the first three months of his tenure, Makinde accused his predecessor and his aides of committing infractions while in office. When asked why Ajimobi and his aides have not been prosecuted despite claims of misdemeanour, Adisa explained that government procedures are long and compulsory, adding that jumping any stage of the process can jeopardise an entire policy or project, no matter how lofty. He alleged that Makindeâ€™s administration has a list of the infractions committed by members of the past administration, as well as documents to prove them, adding, however that the process of establishing the agency, appointing people of impeccable character and ensuring that it is properly set to succeed is long and must be followed. He said they would be brought to justice at the right time. Adisa denied that the Makinde administration was deliberately defaming Ajimobi because of his laudable achievements in infrastructural development, stressing that the new government was only performing the duty of informing the public about the state of governance.
