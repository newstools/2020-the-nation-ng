Two Indians intercepted by the Lagos Airport Command of the Nigeria Immigration service would be made to face the full wrath of the law, the Nigeria Immigration Service said on Sunday. According to its spokesman, Sunday James, the Service intercepted them at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Ikeja for illegally entering Nigeria without proper documentation. James quoted the Airport Comptroller of Immigration, Abdullahi Usman as saying that they were intercepted during the screening of Indians that were being evacuated from Nigeria through the Airport in Lagos. He said Immigration authorities discovered that they entered Nigeria through the land border and had visa on arrival application approval which they failed to present to Immigration at the border. According to him, the men had been In cotonu Benin Republic for a month as they had the stamp of that country dated 9th February 2020 when they left and entered Nigeria illegally. He added that investigations showed that they did not present themselves for Immigration checks at the border, therefore, the two of them who are 32 and 29 years old would be prosecuted according to the Nigeria Immigration laws as deterrence to others. Meanwhile, 446 India nationals were evacuated from Nigeria at the weekend as part of the ongoing evacuation of foreign nationals as a result of the covid 19 pandemic. The Comptroller General of Nigeria Immigration Service Muhammad Babandede also warned migrants to desist from breaking the Immigration laws of countries of transit or destination to avoid sanctions. According to him such sanctions may result into stopping them from coming to Nigeria or payment of fees chargeable, depending on the gravity of the offence committed and what the law stipulates for any of such offence.
