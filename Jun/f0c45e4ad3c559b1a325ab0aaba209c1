 Bayern Munich secured their eighth consecutive Bundesliga title with a 1-0 win against Werder Bremen on Tuesday. The victory opened a 10-point gap between Bayern and second-placed Borussia Dortmund who, despite having three games in hand, cannot catch the champions. A first-half goal by Robert Lewandowski saw the German powerhouse become the first club in a major European league to win the title after returning to play amid the coronavirus pandemic. Bayern are still in pursuit of a Treble, as they will play for the German Cup and remain alive in the Champions League.  Goalkeeper Manuel Neuer shows his world class skills for Bayern after they were left with 10 men for the final 10 minutes following the dismissal of Alphonso Davies, making a sensational one-handed save to ensure yet another league title. The club have dominated the Bundesliga in the last seven years with the average gap between first and second place over 14 points. Borussia Dortmund have finished second four times while RB Leipzig, VfL Wolfsburg and Schalke 04 have each filled the runners up spot once in that time. Borussia Dortmund are likely to finish second this term and could reach a maximum of 75 points. The club dropped crucial points in the first half of the season when they only won 30 of a maximum of 51 points.
