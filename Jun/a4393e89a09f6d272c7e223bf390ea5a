Being in marriage for 25 years is now a great achievement for public figures due to the alarming rate of failed marriages. For Senior Pastor of House on the Rock, Pastor Paul Adefarasin, and his wife, Ifeanyi, there seems to be no need to panic. As the celebrity couple celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary, the wife couldn’t hold back her joy. In a lovely tribute, she wrote: “I had no idea the heights that you would take me to, nor the depths and wonders that you would show me in life. All I knew was that you were a very special man – a unique man, a true man of God and I was being given the privilege and honour of journeying life alongside you. 25 years later, having lived life under your cover, guidance, love and assurance, if I had to  choose again, I would choose you Adeolu. I love you simply because you are an absolutely amazing person who cares deeply and loves easily. You make it so easy to love you. I respect you for the loving husband and caring father that you are. I thank you for being the man you said you would be. With all my love now and forever, I wish you a happy wedding anniversary, my best friend, my husband, my pastor, my forever heartbeat and my love.” For Pastor Adefarasin, it was love at first sight. When she saw Paul in the church he was pasturing at a time, he said he knew they would spend the rest of their lives together as a couple. They became friends afterwards and the rest is what we see now.  The marriage is blessed with two boys and a girl.
