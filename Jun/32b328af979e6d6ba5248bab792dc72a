The General Overseer of Redeemed Christian Church of God, (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adeboye, has urged Nigerians to pray for the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic to stop before the end of June. Adeboye commended the Federal Government over the handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Reacting to the lockdown ease on religious gathering, the clergy thanked the government for its decision. Recall that President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday, June 1st, lifted the ban on religious gatherings across the country through the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19. The ban was placed on religious gatherings to curb the spread of coronavirus. Speaking on Sunday during a live broadcast on Dove TV, on the topic: Flying over mountains, Adeboye urged Christians to worship God appropriately for God to turn the lockdown in their favour. Being the thanksgiving service, Adeboye said: “We thank God for everything the government has been doing during this pandemic. You can’t lock down the whole world forever. Sooner or later, the lockdown will be over. For some people, it will be over sooner than expected. Worship God appropriately and see how the lockdown will be a blessing. “If you learn to worship God, you will see the lockdown becoming an asset rather than a problem. Your duty is to wait on the lord, God is the Guest, you are the waiter, don’t bombard him with request, when you waited on God, you can always fly over several mountains”. He went further that: “we pray that before the end of this month let the COVID-19 pandemic be over. Your duty is to wait on God. You can fly over the mountain of failure. Wait on the lord to fly over the mountain of poverty, barrenness, physical lockdown”.
