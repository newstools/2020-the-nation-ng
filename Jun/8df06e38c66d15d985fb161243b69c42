The Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Farouk has disclosed that about 12,000 N-Power beneficiaries are yet to be paid their three- month stipends. The Minister explained the delay was due to administrative issues, adding they are being resolved. She explained that her ministry is working with the office of the Account General of the Federation to resolve the payment issues. Speaking on Monday during the briefing by members of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, the Minister said: “As far as the ministry is concerned, we have paid N-Power beneficiaries that have been verified and recommended for payment. We have 500,000 N-Power volunteers. “Those who are claiming that they have not been paid, we are looking into these issues with the Office of the Account General of the Federation. “We have had issues around migrating from the platform that we used to operate to the Government Integrated Financial Management Information System (GIFMIS) platform. So, these are the administrative issues that have hindered the payment of some of the volunteers.” On the number of those owed, she said: “There are about 12,000 of them based on our record and as I am speaking with you, the permanent secretary of the ministry is in the office of the accountant general to sort out these issues and once we get the report, we will make it available to all.”
