 Contemporary folklore artist, Segun ‘Beautiful Nubia’ Akinlolu, has taken a swipe at religious and political leaders. The leader of the Roots Renaissance band made a snide remark in an Instagram post dedicated to reawakening his followers. He wrote, ”Who are you listening to? Who are your prophets, your teachers, your guides? Are they these unholy pretenders in gowns and suits speaking for “God”? Are they these agents of Global Oppressors masquerading as political leaders, economic gurus, and international financial experts? Are they these tools of confusion and subjugation labeled “activists”? Are the answers in “sanctified” books and buildings, in the rhetoric of charismatic speakers? Truth is bitter, no one who wants to stay popular and wealthy ever tells it. Nobody seems to want to hear it either. Cool.” Often hailed as a philosopher, Beautiful Nubia is famous for making music built on rich folkloric traditions and native wisdom with a universal message in thrust and theme. The 52-year-old musician, composer, and poet graduated as a veterinary doctor from the University of Ibadan after which he worked for eight years before following his path in music.
