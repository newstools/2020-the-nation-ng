A Coalition of Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) in Ondo State has advised parties to curb plans for violence in the coming election. The Chairman, Mr. Franklin Oloniju, speaking when he visited Minister of Niger Delta Affairs Senator Tayo Alasoadura in Akure, said the utterances and actions of major parties in relation to the governorship poll should be moderated. The group called for stiffer measures that would ensure that integrity of the process and outcome of the coming governorship election were not compromised. Alasoadura thanked the coalition leadership for the visit. He said campaigns are supposed to be a competition of ideas and policies among parties. The minister called on the civil society groups to create a synergy with the major actors to play by the book towards ensuring a peaceful atmosphere before, during and after the election. The coalition lauded the efforts of the minister in reaching out to the coalition.
