 THE Management of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) has declared that the commission’s late acting Director, Finance and Administration, Ibanga Bassey Etang, tested positive for Coronavirus. In a statement signed by its Director, Corporate Affairs, Charles Odili, the commission said it was compelled to make the declaration after getting clearance from the deceased family. “The family has authorized the commission to announce that the late executive director tested positive to COVID-19,”Odili said. He said the Rivers State Ministry of Health wrote to the commission to also confirm that the late director died of complications arising from COVID-19. Odili said: “The ministry has, therefore, directed the commission to order all management staff to go into self-isolation for a period of 14 days with effects from today while seeking the cooperation of the organisation in tracing staff and contractors who have had close contact with the deceased. “During the meeting with the family, they expressed fervent desire that the death of the Executive Director should not be politicised, wishing to be left alone to mourn with dignity.  This also is the position of the commission.”
