NOVAK Djokovic’s coach Goran Ivanisevic has tested positive for coronavirus having previously returned two negative tests. Ivanisevic was the tournament director for the Adria Tour’s Croatian leg in Zadar, which saw its final cancelled after Grigor Dimitrov’s positive coronavirus case. The Covid-19 outbreak also saw Djokovic and wife Jelena test positive, as well as Borna Coric, Viktor Troicki, Dimitrov’s coach Chris Gro and Djokovic’s fitness coach Marko Paniki.  Ivanisevic defended Djokovic, who apologised for holding the tournament, after the abandonment of the Adria Tour. “Everybody is smart now, and they are attacking Novak. He tried to do a great thing, a humanitarian thing. We were locked down for three months. He organized this tour,” Ivanisevic told the New York Times as he defended Djokovic.
