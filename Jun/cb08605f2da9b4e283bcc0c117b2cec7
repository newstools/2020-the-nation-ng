 The war against the spread of  Coronavirus, in Lagos State, received another big boost, over the weekend, as poultry farmers in Epe, under the aegis of Poultry Farmers ‘Association of Nigeria, Lagos State Chapter, Epe Zone,  donated 45,000 eggs to the state government,  as part of its support to the state government, in its fight against the dreaded pandemic. Donating the eggs to the state government , through the state’s Ministry of Agriculture,  the Chairman of Epe Zone of the association,  Folasade  Gam-Ikon,  explained that the gesture  was informed by the need  to complement the  various efforts of the state government in containing the spread of the pandemic in the state. She expressed the belief that the food items, meant for COVID-19 patients and vulnerable families, in the state, would go a long way in aiding the recoveries of such patients and further enhance the health status of other beneficiaries; due to  the immune –boosting nutrients of the food items. Gam-Ikon added that the association was also using the occasion of the donation to create awareness on the benefits of egg to human health, while dismissing some myths surrounding its consumption.  “We believe this type of event also provides us the opportunity to create that awareness that egg is good, and dismiss the myth that egg is high in cholesterol. There is good cholesterol, and there is bad cholesterol. And the fact remains that  egg is good cholesterol,” she added. The Epe Poultry Association’s boss  also argued that  the decision of the  federal  government to include egg in its school feeding programme, coupled with the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) recommendation  of egg as quality food, are eloquent testimonies to the benefits inherent in egg consumption.
