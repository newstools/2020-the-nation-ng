Two men have been arrested by police in Minna, the Niger State capital, with a total of 36 Automated Teller Machine (ATM) cards in their possession. Police said the suspects defraud confused ATM users while pretending to help them. Victor Okebugwu, 32, and James Amaonye, 33, were said to have been perpetrating ATM fraud for over two years. Amaonye said they started in the biggest plaza in Minna, Obasanjo Complex, before moving to the banks. â€œWhen we see people looking confused at the ATM, we approach them and try to help them. They allow us to help them. Most times, we switch the ATMs with fake ones, other times we send the money to our accounts unknown to them. We have been doing it for long. Police spokesman Wasiu Abiodun confirmed the arrest of the suspects, saying they were under police watch for some time. Abiodun said 36 ATM cards from different banks, 24 SIM cards and other items were recovered from them. Abiodun said the suspects would be charged to court after investigation.
