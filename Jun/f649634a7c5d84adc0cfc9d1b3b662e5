The Presidential Task Force(PTF) on COVID-19 has explained why schools cannot reopen now. It said the decision was part of measures being taken to protect vulnerable Nigerians who may have some underlying infections. National Coordinator of the PTF, Dr. Sani Aliyu, said the decision to restrict gathering in churches and mosque was informed by the fact that most of those who go there are within vulnerable Nigerians who may have underlying illnesses. He said the PTF was working closely with the Ministry of Education to work out a resumption plan for schools in view of the fact that majority of students may be living with the vulnerable group of Nigerians they were striving to protect. He said that the plan may be to allow those who were supposed to write examinations to do so saying “we don’t want what has happened to affect the next academic session”. He said 20 percent of Nigerian have underlying infections, adding the government has a responsibility to protect them against infection, hence the suggestion by government for people to stay at home.
