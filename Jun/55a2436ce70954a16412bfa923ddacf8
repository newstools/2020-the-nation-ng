 The Federal Government is partially shutting down the Kara Bridge on the Lagos-Ibadan expressway from today to enable it conduct an integrity test on the bridge. The Federal Controller of Works in Lagos, Mr Kayode Popoola, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that the integrity test was to ascertain the stability of the bridge, following a recent tanker fire that occurred there. The removal of wreckage was scheduled for yesterday  by the contractor, Julius Berger, and the bridge would be partially closed with traffic diverted for work to begin today. The controller said that traffic would be diverted to two lanes, instead of the original three on the highway, and appealed for motorists’ cooperation and understanding. “Kara Bridge got burnt and we have to carry out integrity test. The test will be done by Julius Berger Nigeria Ltd,” he said. “Hopefully, they will remove the wreckage today and then we put the barriers there, then the work will start tomorrow (today). “There is going to be partial closure of one lane in the sense that instead of three lanes, traffic will now be restricted to only two lanes, that is, the Ibadan-bound lane. “The work will be done on Saturday and Sunday; they would finish hopefully on Sunday. “We advise motorists to please slow down and allow us to work so that avoidable accidents can be avoided,” Popoola said. A fire incident occurred on Kara Bridge on Sunday, when two tankers laden with petrol crashed inward Lagos.
