FIFA match agent and stadium facilities expert, Ebi Egbe, has called on Nigeria sporting authorities  to make good use of the lull in sports as a result of COVID-19  to fix infrastructure. Egbe who is the CEO of Monimichelle Group, said in a release that  the time to fix the nation’s sporting facilities is now, even as he thumbed up sports minister Sunday Dare for moving in that direction. “The biggest challenge facing Nigerian sports is that of the poor infrastructure in the country,” he explained.“ Now that there is a lull in sports as a result of the Coronavirus pandemic, this is the time to get it right in that area. “ If we fix our facilities during this period, Nigerian Sports, post Covid-19 would flourish.”
