AN expert with Taxaide Technologies Limited (Taxtech) has emphasised the need for public institutions to take data protection more seriously. Also, as the filing of data protection audits by data controllers nears the June 30 deadline, the NITDA in pursuant of its powers under the NITDA Act, has issued guidelines for the management of personal data by public institutions. Partner, Data Protection Compliance Services, Taxtech, Oyeyemi Oke,  stated that it was imperative to take the conversation of data protection beyond just private organisations. He emphasised that public institutions are custodians of an immense volume of data and without due processes in place, there are higher chances of data breach and abuse of privacy of the data subjects. “The NDPR has provided a means to ensure the data of Nigerian citizens and all persons living within Nigeria are protected and the regulations must be adhered to by all and sundry if we are to achieve the highest standards of data privacy as a nation. There should be no sacred cows whether in the private or public sector,” Oke added. Data controllers are required to engage DPCOs to assist with the compliance process of filing their Statutory Annual Data Protection Audit with NITDA or risk the penalty of N10 million or two per cent of their global revenue.
