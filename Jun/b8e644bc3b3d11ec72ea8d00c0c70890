Organisers of the National Principals Cup for secondary schools have proposed to hold the competition at the end of the year, as a fitting event to relax students from the boredom and trauma of the long lockdown. Coordinator of the age-long and prestigious school sports event and Managing Director of Hideaplus, Tony Pemu, hinted during the week following the release of the protocol for the re-opening of sporting activities in the country and the setting of guidelines for the resumption of football in the continent. “We are aware that schools are yet to open and when it does open, there would be cautious steps for a few more months, but when things are back to normal, we will be holding the National Principals Cup to welcome students back to school to retune their psyche and relax them into normal school life,” Pemu said inter alia.“We are following events closely. The Ministry of Sports and the National Council on Sports are hoping to hold the National Sports Festival between October and November.” The organisers were mandated by the Federal Ministry of Sports last year to re-launch the National Principals Cup, introduce a National Headmasters Cup and repackage the National Youth Games as part of the comprehensive programme of the sports establishment to deepen youth and schools sport for talent discovery and grooming of young athletes in the country.
