The University of Uyo Alumni Association has donated N5 million  to the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria, PSN, (Akwa Ibom State Council) and the Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Uyo, to support research for a cure for the coronavirus. The President of the Association, Rt. Hon. Onofiok Luke, who presented the donation, noted that universities around the world were working as well as sharing information on how to end the pandemic and there was a need for the institution to do same. He expressed optimism that the  cure for the pandemic could be found in the state and harnessed in the laboratories of the Faculty of Pharmacy of the university. “This particular strain of the virus was unknown to man but now it is here. Our researchers and research institutions need to rise to the occasion in challenging this pandemic that threatens our collective existence. Let us not think that the cure to coronavirus will come or can only come from abroad, it may be right here with us in Akwa Ibom and it is in your hands to bring it forth,” he said. He urged them to do their best and ensure the appropriate use of the funds, reassuring them of the support of the alumni. Receiving the grant, the Dean of Pharmacy, Dr.  Emmanuel  Etim, who thanked the alumni for the  initiative, lauded the association for its zeal for scientific work. He lamented that the bane of research had always been scarcity of funds. He pledged that the funds would be used judiciously. Responding, Chairman, PSN, Akwaowoh Akpabio, appreciated the gesture and prayed God’s wisdom on the leadership of the alumni. The event was attended by the Dean of Pharmacy, University of Uyo, Dr. Emmanuel Etim; Chairman PSN, Akwaowoh Akpabio; Deputy President of the Alumni, Dr. Godwin Akpan; Alumni Secretary and Vice Dean of Students’ Affairs, Dr. Essien Akpan Uko and other members of the association.
