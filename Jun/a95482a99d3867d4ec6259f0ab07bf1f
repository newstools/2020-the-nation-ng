As we gradually approach the full rainy season, it is no gainsaying that the effects of flooding on affected residents are unquantifiable and devastating. Sadly, the menace of flooding has rendered many people homeless. The Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NHISA) had earlier warned many parts of the country are likely to experience flooding this year due to heavy downpour caused by climate change. In the past few weeks, persistent rainfall has sent Lagos and some other states into flooding crisis. Sadly, there was an unfortunate harvest of deaths in Lagos where two children- a 17-year-old girl, identified as Ayisat and four-year-old Azeezat- were swept away in a ravaging flood that hit the state and its environs after a torrential downpour. So, when there is a heavy rainfall, here are few tips to stay safe during a heavy downpour: 1. When everywhere is flooded, do not walk through moving water. As little as 6 inches of moving water can make you fall. 2. It’s very important that you do not swim or drive through flood waters. Turn around and stay safe first! 3. It’s necessary that you stay off bridges over fast-moving water. Fast-moving water can wash bridges away without warning. 4. Most drivers don’t obey this but it’s very risky – you must not drive into flooded areas. If floodwaters rise around your car, abandon the car and move to higher ground if you can do so safely. 5. Do not touch electrical equipment if you are wet or standing in water. 6. If your home is flooded, turn off your electricity when you return home. You should also stay away from downed power lines. 7. Stop dumping dirt/refuse into the drainage system, this can cause blockage thus causing undeserved dangers leading to overflooding. Also, the government has enjoined all parents and guardians to ensure adequate safety of their children, wards and young adults by insisting, and restraining them indoors during rainfalls and away from after rain floodings.
