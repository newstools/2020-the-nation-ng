The traditional ruler of Nibo community in Awka South council of Anambra State, Igwe Chukwuemeka Ngene, on Tuesday led a protest march against what they called the invasion of their land and destruction of economic trees by a neighbouring community. Teaming up with the monarch were several elders like Nze Christopher Onuorah, 89, and Pa Davidson Okeke, 85, among others. Priests equally joined the protest, as did women and youths. The community said the timely intervention of President Muhammadu Buhari by sending a security team after their petition prevented a bloody clash with the encroaching neighbours.
