The Chief Judge of Ekiti State, Justice Ayodeji Daramola, has granted amnesty to 33 inmates as part of efforts to decongest the Ado-Ekiti correctional centre. The breakdown of the inmates included 18 awaiting trial, 13 convicts and two were granted bail during the pardon on liberal terms. A statement by the Chief Registrar of the Ekiti State Judiciary, Mr. Johnson Apuabi, said Justice Daramola gave the directive during his visit to the Correctional centre, on Wednesday. Justice Daramola said his visit to the Correctional Centre was practically in line with the directive of the CJN to decongest Correctional Centres across the country to stem the tide of Covid-19 spread and for general decongestion. The Jurist added that the measure was taken at this appropriate time when the Coronavirus is ravaging the entire country with the tally kept increasing on daily basis. He said: “13 Convicts were granted amnesty based on old age, others were pardoned based on the fact that their jail term is near completion. “In all, 334 cases were reviewed, 18 were pardoned based on lesser offences committed ranging from burglary to stealing and theft, while two were granted bail on liberal terms”. Justice Daramola stated that the visit was a low key event devoid of crowd and done in compliance with the Ekiti State’s directive banning large gatherings. “Those present adhered strictly to all values and regulations guiding the spread of Coronavirus,” he said. The Chief Judge thanked officers of the correctional centre for maintaining hygienic condition, admonishing the pardoned inmates to make the best of the amnesty by shunning criminal activities capable of bringing them back to prison.
