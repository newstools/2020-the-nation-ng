 The Concerned Parents and Educators (CPE) Network, a group of over 140,000 parents and educators, has instituted an essay competition for teachers to mark its fifth anniversary. The teachers have until June 20, 2020 to turn in a 1,500-word essay on “The Future of Education Post-Covid.” The top three winners will get N100,000, N50,000 and N25,000 as prizes, while the fourth to seventh best essayists will be rewarded with books. Founder of the group, Mrs. Yinka Ogunde said the competition was initiated to draw attention to the plight of teachers as a result of the COVID-19 lockdown of schools. “CPE will be five on June 24, 2020 and one of the basic problems we have seen through this pandemic is the lack of teachers’ welfare.  We are doing this with the hope that it will draw attention to the welfare of teachers.  Imagine the number of teachers that are not getting paid during this lockdown and there is no hope of money coming in from anywhere. “We are hoping the government will act and make the teaching profession more dignifying,” she said.
