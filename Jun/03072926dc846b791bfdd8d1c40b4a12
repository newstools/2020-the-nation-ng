All Progressives Congress (APC) National Vice Chairman, Hillard Eta, alleging a plot to attack him by some sponsored thugs. He also said the same thugs planned to burn down the national secretariat of the ruling APC in Abuja in order to create the impression that the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party did not want Victor Giadom to access the building. Eta, in a distress telephone call to the Press Centre in the APC secretariat, added that the  thugs were being recruited from Port Harcourt, Rivers State. The  claims by Eta, who is standing in for the NWC-recognised acting National Chairman of the party, Senstor Abiola Ajimobi, came  a day after the Police sealed the secretariat.
