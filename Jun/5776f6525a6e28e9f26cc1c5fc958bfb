 INSPECTOR-General of Police Mohammed Adamu on Monday unveiled operational guidelines for law enforcement agents on COVID-19 prevention enforcement duties. The guidelines were developed in collaboration with the CLEEN Foundation and the United Kingdom High Commission. It lists measures to foster a more harmonious relationship between the Police and the public, deepen respect for the rights of citizens, and provide a new set of policing tools for tackling emerging crimes, such as domestic violence, rape, child molestation and other incidents of Gender-Based Violence (GBV). Adamu said the guidelines will help to adequately coordinate and reshape the conduct of law enforcement agents on the frontline of operations in the enforcement of the COVID-19 prevention orders. The guidelines would also serve as a standard code of conduct for Police officers in similar operations in the future, he said. Executive Director of CLEEN Foundation, Benson Olugbuo, said the guidelines would help security agencies who are deployed to enforce the lockdown and restriction of movement act within the provisions of the Constitution, the Police Act and other extant regulations.
