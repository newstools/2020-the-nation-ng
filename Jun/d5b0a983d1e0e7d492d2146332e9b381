Craig Dawson’s stoppage-time bicycle kick saw Watford earn a 1-1 draw against Leicester City on their return to Premier League action after a thrilling finale at Vicarage Road. Ben Chilwell’s 90th minute strike looked to have given the Foxes all three points but Dawson’s acrobatic effort saw the hosts deservedly share the spoils. Hornets midfielder Abdoulaye Doucoure missed the best chance of a lacklustre first half, firing straight at Kasper Schmeichel after Troy Deeney had nicked the ball away from Wilfred Ndidi on the edge of the Leicester box.  Moments after the restart, Ismaila Sarr had an even better opening after being sent clear by Etienne Capoue but Schmeichel was out sharply to make a superb sprawling stop. Caglar Soyuncu should have found the net with a header from close range after James Maddison’s terrific free-kick delivery, though VAR may have ruled him too have been marginally offside.
