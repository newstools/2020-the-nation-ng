 THE remains of Ibidunni Ighodalo, a former beauty queen and late wife of the Lagos-based preacher and founder of Trinity House, Pastor Ituah Ighodalo, was laid to rest yesterday afternoon amidst tears. Aged 39, she died on Sunday June 15, “of suspected cardiac arrest while in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital, where she had gone to work.” Dignitaries that attended the funeral service, aired live via the church’s social media platforms and monitored in Lagos, included Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State, who represented Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State and Pastor Idowu Oluyomade, the Personal Assistant to the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye. It would be recalled that Adeboye had earlier said the late businesswoman “is in a better place.” He wrote on his Facebook: “Hearing the news of Ibidunni Ighodalo’s demise was really saddening but I know that she is in a better place right now. I pray that the Almighty himself will comfort the family of Pastor Ituah Ighodalo in Jesus name”. Earlier in the week, the family and the Church organized a solemn evening of hymns, psalms and candlelight in her honour. At the event, ace gospel artistes like Buchi, Igeh, Wale, Chigozie, Derby, Alaba, the Trumpeter from Covenant Harvest Church, and the Trinity House Zion Choir, among other solo and group singers, presented special renditions. Other soulful gospel interludes that rented the hall included: “I’m No Longer Slave to Fear,” “It Won’t Be Long, We’ll Be Leaving Here,” “In Christ Alone”, “Oceans”, “Through All the Changing Scenes of Life”, “Le Yi Jesu Ko Se Ni Tan O”, “It is Well”, “Comforter, That’s Who You are to Me”, “Fear Him, Ye Saints and You Will Have Nothing Else to Fear”
