The Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Ibrahim Muhamma formally inaugurated, on Friday in Abuja, Justice Monica Bonna’an Dongban-Mensem as the substantive President of the Court of Appeal (PCA). Justice Mohammed, after administering the oath of office on Dongban-Mensem, admonished her to maintain the credibility of the Court of Appeal. The CJN urged Dongban-Mensem to live up to expectations by maintaining cordial relationship with her colleagues on the Appeal court bench. The event was attended by the Governors of Sokoto, Plateau, Niger and Kebbi states. The CJN, while noting that the Appeal Court has the largest number of Justices, charged the new PCA to be up and doing. Justice Muhammad said Dongban-Mensem, being the second female President of the court, should ensure regular meetings with the heads all divisions of the court and other Justices to enable them fully understand the court’s operations. He added: “From my personal experience, the workload in the Court of Appeal, especially in the divisions is the highest. It is a home of work, it is a home of cooperation, but with your experience, hard-work and zeal, you will not find your new status difficult. “If you sustain your good character and conduct, your tenure will definitely be a excellent one. Try to be your self and do not allow others derail you. Remain what we know you for,” CJN said. Responding, Dongban-Mensem, said she felt honoured and challenged to be appointed to the office of the PCA, based on the recommendation of the National Judicial Council (NJC) and the approval of President Muhammafu Buhari. The new PCA assured all that she will do all within her best to ensure the effective dispensation of justice by the court. She promised to build on the legacy left behind by her predecessors.
