 Seun Kuti, the afrobeat singer, and son of late Fela Anikulapo Kuti has said that most artists who claim to draw inspiration from his late father actually don’t but only take that as an excuse to smoke and frolic with women. The Afrobeat musician who took over his father’s Egypt 80 band after his demise made this statement during an Instagram live interview session with record label owner Ubi Franklin. When asked about his opinion about what artists who claim to be inspired by Fela, Seun said “I think a lot of them grow up in Christian and Muslim homes but use Fela as an excuse to smoke and chase girls. “And also using Fela as a reason to be reckless and rude to your elders. They are not rude to the authorities”.
