A former governorship aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ekiti State, Otunba Olusegun Agbalajobi, has warned that the party may collapse if the alleged impunity by Governor Kayode Fayemi is not addressed. He said the governor should be held responsible for the internal crisis rocking the APC, noting that it could tear the party apart and undermine the quest of the leadership to sustain its stronghold on the state. The APC chieftain, in a statement in Ado-Ekiti, alleged that the ruling party under the leadership of Fayemi was riddled with impunity, injustice and disregard for the principle of internal democracy.He alleged that Fayemi’s actions and inactions within the party showed that he did not mean well for the APC after he might have completed his tenure, adding that the chapter was being run by the governor through his surrogates. \Agbalajobi said members and leaders regretted working for the governor’s electoral success in the July 14 governorship election, adding that those he perceived as adversaries were annihilated from the running of the APC. APC state Publicity Secretary Ade Ajayi described the allegations of running the party without recourse to party structures as “mere conjectures that cannot stand the test of validity.” He said Governor Fayemi had been carrying members along and never breached any provision of APC legal framework in the running of the state chapter.
