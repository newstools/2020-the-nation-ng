Policemen who allegedly brutalised women lawyers attached to rights group, Women Aid Collective (WACOL), in Enugu State, would face full disciplinary action, the Police Service Commission (PSC) said on Thursday. The Commission also endorsed the report of the Special Panel of Enquiry set up by the Commissioner of Police, Enugu State Command on the alleged police brutality. In January this year it was reported that lawyers working for the organisation had refused to provide an alleged victim of rape, and that four plainclothes police officers made up of two men and two women had stormed the New Haven office of the non-governmental organisation, reputed for championing the rights of the vulnerable on January 30  and allegedly brutalised some of its members of staff for not giving up the victim. The report of the special panel had recommended that the police officers who were directly involved in the incident be made to face full disciplinary measures to serve as deterrent to others. The endorsement of the report was an outcome of the Commission’s 8th plenary meeting which began on Tuesday, June 9, 2020 and ended on Thursday June 11, 2020. The meeting was presided over by Commission’s chairman, Musiliu Smith, a retired Inspector General of Police.
