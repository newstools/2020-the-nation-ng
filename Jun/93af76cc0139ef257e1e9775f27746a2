 A group of non-government organizations, NGOs including Women’s Voice and Leadership (WVL), Women’s Right and Health Project (WRAHP), The Voice of Women’s Radio, NECA’s Network of Entrepreneurial Women (NNEW) and Centre for Gender Economics (CGE Africa) have called on all decision makers to implement stricter punishments for rape perpetrators. They made this call during the week at the NECA house Lagos. Speaking on behalf of the NGOs, Bose Ironsi of WRAHP, said if stricter punishments were put in place, they will prevent rapists from carrying out such acts freely and without fear of consequences. “We call for improved collaboration between security agencies, civil society organizations and human right defenders working to reduce the incidences and impact of sexual violence against women in Lagos State,” she stated. Declaring they believe some institutional measures should be taken to strengthen the legal environment in responding effectively to the menace of SGBV, she said they include the domestication of the Violence Against Person Prohibition (VAPP) Act, the establishment of Sexual Assault Referral Centres (SARC) in all local governments in Lagos State.  Others include the establishment of police task force on GBV to ensure prompt investigation and prosecution of all reported incidences of sexual assaults, mandatory training of Police Officers in Lagos State on how to respond effectively to GBV cases and the issuance of an executive order by the State Governor to forbid the illegal practice of civil settlement and mediation in any incidence of sexual violence. Uchenna Idoko of CGE said the punishment for rape should be life imprisonment without parole and 14 years for domestic violence. Noting the major challenge that victims face is the ability to prove they were raped, she welcomed the idea of rape court about to take off in Lagos and said the fight against rape should be taken to rural communities in Lagos State.
