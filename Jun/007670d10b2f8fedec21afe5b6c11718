The bank ensures that insurance claims are paid in time and policy holders receive adequate compensation to cover losses incurred during any unfortunate incident covered in the insurance policy. “To substantiate this point, we have processed insurance claims to our clients worth N1,881,552,440.59 from 2014-2019. ‘’The proficiency we have attained in rendering micro-financial services; our strong branch network spanning different regions of the country and our loyal customer base have properly positioned us to render insurance services to low and middle income earners.’’
