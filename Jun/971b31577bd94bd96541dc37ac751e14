THE Lagos State government said it will continue to drive the state economy with technology for optimum productivity. It said it has therefore re-invigorated its e-governance operations, with the innovation of the LASG Campus Network, an enterprise infrastructure that connects thousands of computers from all ministries departments and agencies (MDAs) within and around the secretariat for e-governance operations. The state Commissioner for Science and Technology, Mr. Hakeem Fahm, who spoke on Wednesday  at the  Ministerial Press Briefing, commemorating the one year anniversary of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu led administration, said the state is fully committed to leading in ICT for greater good of the state and the country. He said the upgrade optimises the current network to reliably and securely support new and existing applications and devices. Fahm said the main objective of the optimisation is to increase network availability, performance and security of the LASG Campus Enterprise Network as well as stabilise its ICT environment for a smarter Lagos.
