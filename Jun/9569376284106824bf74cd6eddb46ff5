Justice Adedayo Akintoye of Igbosere High Court, Lagos on Monday sentenced two men, Kingsley Baba and Bashiru Musa, to 21 years imprisonment each for robbery. Justice Akintoye found the convicts guilty of robbing their boss, Mrs Olutosin Abiola Oshinowo, at Ikoyi, Lagos. The state government arraigned the defendants in 2017 for conspiracy and armed robbery, a charge they denied, and were remanded at a correctional centre. Justice Akintoye held that the evidence of three prosecution witnesses established that a robbery was indeed committed on December 8, 2015, but not armed robbery, and that there was no eyewitness account to corroborate the offence of armed robbery. The defendants were sentenced to 21 years imprisonment each. A court in Ikeja, Lagos on Monday also discharged five men who have been remanded in Kirikiri Maximum Correctional Centre for nine years for armed robbery due to lack of evidence. Justice Adenike Coker discharged Ramon Ganiyu, Alex Azubuike, Yusuf Maboreje, Sanya Adetunji and Akeem Akintoye of the 15-count charge filed against them by the state. Freeing the defendants, the judge noted that the office of the Lagos Sate Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr Moyosore Onigbanjo (SAN) had issued a Notice of Discontinuance due to non-viability of the case.
