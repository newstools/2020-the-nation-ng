Tyson Fury has slammed Anthony Joshua over his speech at a Black Lives Matter march in Watford earlier this month. Unified heavyweight champion Joshua addressed a crowd of many hundreds of people at a march arranged after the death of George Floyd in police custody in the US. The speech was written by Joshua’s friend who could not attend the march and one section, taken out of context, drew criticism after AJ said: “Show them where it hurts. “Abstain from spending your money in their shops and economies, and invest in black-owned businesses.” After online backlash to the speech, Joshua responded with a statement calling for his comments to be taken in context.  Fury has now given his verdict on Joshua’s speech, insisting his fellow Brit is entitled to his opinion but claiming he would be “crucified” if he made comparable comments. “I’m sure AJ has got his reasons why he said what he said, and its concern is none of my business what he said,” Fury told Behind The Gloves. “That’s his own opinion and everyone to their opinion. Whatever his reasons were, he’s done it and it’s in the past so it’s moved on. “I’m sure he’s apologised if he’s offended anybody – oh he actually didn’t, did he! He actually said if you didn’t like what I said, go f*** yourself. So no apology necessary.”
