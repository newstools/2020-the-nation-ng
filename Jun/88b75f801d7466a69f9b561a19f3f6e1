The Coalition for A Better Nigeria said on Tuesday that it had rescheduled an event to mark the 26th anniversary of Epetedo self-declaration by the late MKO Abiola. The event, originally fixed for tomorrow at old Epetedo Hall or Eleganza Sports Centre at 11am, has been postponed indefinitely. The group said this was in line with the federal and state governments’ measures to curb the spread of the novel Coronavirus disease. In a statement, its National Coordinator, Comrade Awa Bamiji, said the “prepared papers on the proposed lecture: ‘Remembering 1993 and Thinking 2023’ are still relevant and we urge our prospective participants across the states of the federation to please take note.”
