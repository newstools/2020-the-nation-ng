Leading members of Adogun Atele family in Itele, Ogun State, have urged Governor Dapo Abiodun, former President Olusegun Obasanjo, the Department of State Services (DSS) and the Inspector General of Police (IGP) to intervene in the alleged destruction of their properties by Adewunmi Abiodun Odutala and Kehinde Odubade Atiku. In a petition jointly signed by a retired Assistant Comptroller of Custom, Fasanya Salami Agbaji and the Head of Adogun Atele family, Chief Taoreed Momodu Dada, the petitioners raised the alarm that there had been persistent threats to the lives of Fasanya Agbaje Salami, Titilayo Fasanya and Sir Sunday Nnamdi Nwosu over the matter. “We call on the governor of Ogun State, the state’s Attorney General, Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, Ogun State House of Assembly, the Alake of Egba land, Awujale of Ijebu land, Akarigbo of Remo, Olu of Ilaro, Olofin of Isheri, Ado/Odo/Ota Local Government Area and the Chief Registrar of the Supreme Court that by virtue of the Supreme Court judgment in Arowolo Vs Olowookere (2011) 3 NWLR Pt. 1278 Pg. 280, Adogun Atele Family (Comprising four branches of Osa, Imidawo, Ogunrounbi and Alagbeji) is the only family eligible to present a candidate for the vacant stool of Onitele of Itele,” the statement added. The petitioners warned the public not to buy land in Itele from Ogungbemi Alagbeji family or any other person who had earlier bought from Ogungbemi Alagbeji and Odutala family as the entire Itele land is a subject of litigation at the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court in appeal number CA/I/367/2014 – Oba Adewunmi Adeniji Odutala Vs Chief Taoridi Dada; Ca/I/19/2014 – Mr. Saibu Olugbode & Two Others Vs Chief Taoridi Dada & Another & Ca/I/169/2013 – Chief Samuel Olatunji Asorobi & Ors Vs Chief Taoreed Dada & Another. The statement maintained that Wakilu Adele Arowolo, Afusatu Akapo, Monday Akapo, Mufuli Akapo, Kafaru Abimbola Akapo, Abosede Akapo are neither the head nor principal members of Adogun Atele but only parading themselves as such in order to deceive the public. Members of the public are advised not to transact any business with them in the name of Adogun Atele family.
