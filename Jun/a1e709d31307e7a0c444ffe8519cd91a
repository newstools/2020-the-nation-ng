COMMUNITY leaders in Oturkpo, headquarters of Benue South Senatorial district, have called on the Police Area Commander in the area to arrest a man who allegedly raped a 15 year old girl, Miss Ene Augustine. Augustine was allegedly raped by Eddy Ujah, who is said to be on the run since the incident. Members of the community have been protesting the alleged rape which occurred last week, as youths and women daily take to streets of Oturkpo in peaceful protests, demanding that justice be done in the matter. Meanwhile, elders in the community where the alleged incident happened have written to the Oturkpo Area Police Command, calling for the arrest and prosecution of Eddy Ujah, who is nowhere to be found. Otada Elders Council, in Otada community, Oturkpo, in the petition which was signed by Chief Oketa Out, condemned the rape of the Miss Ene and described as barbaric, the action of the suspect. Chief Otu in his petition said it was senseless and inhuman for anyone to rape the 15 year old girl who just survived a major surgery. He said the act was an abomination in the community and called on the federal government and security agencies to protect the communities against further act of criminality. Police spokesperson, Kate Anene, a DSP, confirmed the incident and said the police have launched manhunt against the suspect and would soon arrest and bring him to justice.
