The newly certified Polymerase Chain Reaction Laboratory (PCR) built and equipped by the Akwa Ibom State government has commenced the testing of COVID-19 samples. The PCR lab approved last week by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) on Friday received 22 samples. The samples were received by a team of Laboratory personnel led by Professor Tatfeng Mirabeau,a Consultant molecular biologist, department of medical laboratory science, Niger Delta University, Bayelsa State. Samples from suspected cases from Akwa Ibom were hitherto taken to Irrua Specialist Hospital in Edo State for testing and this procedure took not less than 48 hours before the results were released. The lead consultant of the PCR, Prof. Mirabeau said, “the establishment of the Laboratory in the state has guaranteed testing of suspected COVID-19 samples and fast release of results. “I commend the Akwa Ibom State Government for putting up one of the best of such laboratories in the Country without any external assistance”. He said that whereas other PRC labs in the Country test only covid-19, the laboratory in the state would avail patients several other laboratory services while on admission. The consultant commended the commissioner for works, Mr Ephraim Inyang-Eyen for his sincerity and commitment towards translating the vision of Governor Udom Emmanuel at the isolation centre. He said the Akwa Ibom PCR laboratory was the 31st to be approved by the NCDC. The head the of Public Health Laboratory services in the State, Mrs Idongesit Udoh who was also present during the arrival of samples, thanked the State Government for this laudable feat. She said the state government was doing its best in the containment of the disease and advised anyone with symptoms of the virus to report to the appropriate Medical Facility for testing and management.
