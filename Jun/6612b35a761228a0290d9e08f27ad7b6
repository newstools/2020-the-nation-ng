 Madrid continue their winning run with a 2-0 victory over Mallorca. Real Madrid leapfrogged Barcelona to the top of the La Liga standings after a 2-0 win over relegation-threatened Mallorca on Wednesday. Both Real and Barca have 68 points but Los Blancos hold the advantage in the title race due to a superior head-to-head record. Real’s first goal came in the 19th minute when Luka Modric linked up with Vinicius Junior, who subsequently had a classy chip into the net over Manuel. He could’ve doubled the lead minutes later but his chipped shot bounced back off the top of the crossbar. The goal did not occur without controversy as Mallorca players clamoured that Dani Carvajal should have been booked for his hard challenge on Dani in the setup.  There was no question on Real’s second when Sergio Ramos struck a magnificent free kick in the 57th minute into the top corner of the net. Mallorca had plenty of looks in the match with Japan youngster and Real loanee Takefusa Kubo coming close on several occasions for a goal. The match was notable as 15-year-old Luka Romero became the youngest player ever in a La Liga match when he come as a Mallorca substitute in the final minutes.
