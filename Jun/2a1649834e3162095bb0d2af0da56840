2020 BET Award nominee, Rema, has revealed how he had sketched his current public image long before fame came along. Rema made this known in a recent interview with BET Africa on Instagram while revealing sketching as his hidden talent. He said: “I know how to sketch, pencil or biro, I used to do that in classes when I’m bored I just sketch. I sketched a lot of ideas that we have out today that are part of my aesthetics, before I started wearing the whole mask, the teddy bear, I used to sketch and see myself and be like this is my character before I was unveiled. I used to be in my room sketching stuff like how I wanted to look, how I wanted people to perceive me”. Turning his talent into business merchandise, he said “Right now my team is just working more on my music but the other chambers of ideas will be unveiled very soon, I don’t show my work out there on my stories and my page until it is set”, Rema hinted. Rema noted that his recent nomination in the 2020 BET Awards for Best International Act and Viewers’ Choice Best New International Act is a wonderful opportunity. “I want to say a big thanks to God for this wonderful opportunity, I want to give a big shout out to my fans out there supporting me out there supporting me and showing me all the love, this is huge. I believe that bringing this home will take the generation and Afrobeat to a much higher level. This means a lot to me, Nigeria, and the lots of my fans out there. I want to say I love you guys and I want you guys to keep supporting. The album coming out soon, I don’t want to give much info but hopefully, we do big things together, I can’t wait to see you guys again, I can’t wait to be on those stages raving with you guys and telling you guys how much I love you,” Rema said.
