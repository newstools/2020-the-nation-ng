The Olayide Adelami Campaign Organisation has unearthed plans to forcefully use the All Progressives Congress (APC) local government chairmen in Ondo State to discredit the membership of Chief Olaide Owolabi Adelami, a governorship aspirant for the July 20 primaries. The campaign team, in a statement on Wednesday in Abuja by Segun Ogodo, a lawyer, urged the national leadership of the APC and the presidency to disregard what is described as ‘campaign of calumny’ against their principal. He said: “For record purposes, Chief Adelami is a registered member of the APC at Igboroko 2 Ward 3 where he worked for the success of all APC candidates in the 2019 general election.”
