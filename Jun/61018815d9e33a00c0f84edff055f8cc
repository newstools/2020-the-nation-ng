 THE internal crisis rocking the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ekiti State, has festered, and the gladiators are ready to come into the open arena to do real battle. It appears two very big political elephants are gradually unfolding their plans foar a big fight. Already, the grass is crying out. In a move described by many observers as opposed to the interest of Governor Kayode Fayemi and the state leadership of the party, executives and members of the APC in Ado-Ekiti Ward 8 in Ekiti State have unanimously passed a vote of confidence on the Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Political Matters, Senator Babafemi Ojudu. Ado-Ekiti Ward 8 is also the ward of Fayemi’s deputy, Chief Bisi Egbeyemi. Ojudu has been accusing Fayemi of running the affairs of the party like his personal business, while the governor’s aides have been labeling him as overambitious. The leadership of the party in the state, supporting the governor, has pushed for the suspension of Ojudu by his ward executives for alleged anti-party activities. But speaking after a meeting on Wednesday, chairman of Ward 8, Ayo Afolabi, said no amount of intimidation and financial inducement from state leaders of the party would make them suspend Ojudu. The position of the ward executives to spare Ojudu, Sentry learnt, has angered the governor and other party leaders while the same decision has emboldened Ojudu and other aggrieved party chieftains to come out and take on Fayemi and his supporters in the days to come. The implication is that APC in the state may be headed for stormy waters in the days ahead.
