Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State on Saturday directed the re-opening of courts in the state from tomorrow after being shut on June 19 following the outbreak of Coronavirus pandemic. The governor ordered the closure of all courts when he announced the first death recorded from the pandemic in the state. The governor also directed all judicial officers and their families to immediately undergo the COVID-19 tests. The state COVID-19 committee was mandated to fumigate all the courts with a repeat of the exercise after 10 days. Information and Orientation Commissioner, Uchenna Orji, said in a statement in Abakaliki that the decision to re-open the courts was reached after the governor’s consultation with the state’s Chief Judge. ”The governor, however, emphasised the need for individuals to strictly observe the wearing of face masks and observe social distancing, while conducting their private or public businesses,” Orji said.
