 A chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC and a former House of Representatives aspirant in Osun State,  Hon. Adegboyega Bello, has attributed the economic gains in Osun under the administration of Governor Gboyega Oyetola to the financial prowess and understanding of the Osun State helmsman. Bello, who is also a financial expert, made this known while speaking on the efforts of the Osun government in curbing the spread of COVID-19 in the State . He described the governor as an experienced, thorough bred administrator who has dazzled his critics with his structured and methodical approach in combating the spread of COVID-19 in the state, a situation that has led to positive containment of the dreaded virus within the State of Osun.  The APC chieftain said Osun’s fragile economy would have probably collapsed if not for the display of the exceptional stewardship and leadership skills of Governor Oyetola in managing the very lean resources of the state. According to Bello,  it’s most fascinating to learn that close to a whopping N35 Billion has been paid off from Osun debt balance since Governor Oyetola assumed office in addition to  massive infrastructural  projects ongoing across the state,  a case in point being the completion of  renovation and upgrading of about 250 Primary health centers across the state all within  18 months in office. It only takes financial acumen and much needed discipline to be able to drive the state with obvious financial constraints that the state is faced with’.
