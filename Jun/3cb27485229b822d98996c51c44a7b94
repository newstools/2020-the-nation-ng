Federal Capital Territory  Football Association( FCTFA) chairman Adam Mohammed Mouktar said he was committed to making football in Abuja and its environs a model to follow in the country as he celebrates his first year in office. Elected  20th June  2019, Mouktar has brought his magic wand to bear with some far reaching programs and projects including partnership with German Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich and introduction of Teqball new sports amongst other landmarks. “My experience has been remarkable in the true sense because we had a plan; we executed it and it has transformed the football landscape filled with hope that the future can and will be very bright,” explained Mouktar. “I have seen how very passionate people are about the game they love.” In the period under review, the Mouktar-led board rebranded and improved the FCT League with cash prizes for winners along with renovation of the Area 3 and Area 10 pitches; human capacity building with all expenses paid courses for 21 male and female coaches drawn from all the six as well as technical partnership with the Embassy of Hungary on sports cooperation and exchange. “I have nothing to say than a big appreciation for the support from the government; CT Director Of sports, my Board members, my team around me, my constituents in the six  Area  Councils, all the fans and the ordinary good will from the public has been tremendous,” Mouktar further said. “That’s how we have managed to do so much within our first year. The FCT has experienced a renaissance and commendations from all over the country.” Yet Mouktar said he was not resting on his oars: “We intend to strengthen the core foundations of football development; developed grassroots players, referees, coaches, administrators and to grow the fan base across the area councils “In the long term, we intend to get massive sponsorship for various competitions, grow female football, grow a few world class football academies and build more playing pitches,” noted Mouktar who few years ago represented the continent at the novel FIFA Fan Focus Group (50 Great Minds of football).
