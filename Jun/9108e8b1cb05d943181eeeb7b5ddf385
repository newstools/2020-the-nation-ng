 STANBIC IBTC Holdings PLC has urged employees to embrace digitisation and build career resilience through diversity and up-skilling to be outstanding in the workplace. Its Country Head, Human Capital, Olufunke Amobi, gave the advice  during a Virtual Learning Series themed “Building career resilience”. Mrs. Amobi said forces of change involving rapid technological advancements, such as Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, cognitive technologies and crowdsourcing, are the rationale for the evolution of careers and their shift from traditional to contemporary. She noted that the traditional career path was defined in terms of linear progression up the firm’s hierarchy while seeking to obtain greater extrinsic rewards. The contemporary career trajectory, on the other hand, focuses on experiences and competencies that exist across firms, driven by values that are more flexible and dynamic. The Stanbic IBTC Holdings PLC Country Head of Human Capital urged participants to build contemporary careers as well as a strong network to enable them attain success in their professions. She advocated the need for workers to invest in technology and exploit various websites for free online courses to develop their digital literacy skills.
