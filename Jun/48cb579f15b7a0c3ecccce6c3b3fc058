The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has sought the intervention of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) in what the party described as unchecked spread of the infection and increasing number of COVID-19 deaths in Kogi State in the past few weeks. In a statement on Monday by the PDP spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan, the party said the state government has not demonstrated the required capacity to guarantee the health and safety of the people. The PDP queried the laid back attitude of Governor Yahaya Bello towards COVID-19 prevention and management protocols, a situation, the party said, is resulting in the spread and avoidable deaths in the state. The state’s Chief Judge, Justice Nasiru Ajana, who died in Abuja on Sunday, was reported to have died at a COVID-19 isolation centre in the Federal Capital City, where he was being treated. The state government has continued to deny the existence of the coronavirus in the state, even as fatalities are being recorded among some of its prominent citizens. “Our party is deeply worried over alleged unreported cases of COVID-19 as well as issues of ‘silent deaths’ in the state. “The PDP notes that issue of unreported cases of COVID-19 in Kogi State has put citizens in fear, especially as Governor Bello’s administration has remained nonchalant and unresponsive towards the matter,” the party said. The state PDP chapter also called on Bello to immediately proceed on 14 days self-isolation for attending Justice Ajanah’s burial.
