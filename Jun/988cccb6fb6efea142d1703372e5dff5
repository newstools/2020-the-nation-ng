The Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi has stated that he holds no grudge against Governor Seyi Makinde. The suspicion of grudge followed the recent siting of the Police Mobile Squadron in Ago-Are. It was rumoured the monarch facilitated the police unit for Oyo town but it was reportedly hijacked and taken elsewhere by Makinde.
