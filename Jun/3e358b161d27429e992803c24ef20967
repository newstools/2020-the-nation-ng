Victor Moses has made it clear that he wants to stay at Inter for the long haul, ‘to win with Antonio Conte, this fantastic club and these incredible fans’. Speaking to Inter’s Matchday Programme for their Serie A game against Sassuolo last night, Moses revealed how football was his ‘reason for living’. “I love football, it’s been my passion since I was a child,” he explained. “It’s in my blood and what I love doing. The turning point of my career came when I made my debut with Crystal Palace when I was 16. I entered the pitch and the atmosphere was incredible. It made me think that football was my reason for living, something where I could give everything with 100 percent commitment.” The wingback’s loan move to the Nerazzurri in January saw him link up with Antonio Conte, his coach at Chelsea. “He’s a great man and coach, I know his methods well. He wants the best from his players and that’s the main reason I’m here because I’ve worked with him and I know what he wants: he just wants us to go out there, work hard and have fun while putting our idea of football into practice.”
