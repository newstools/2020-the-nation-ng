Manchester City are set to find out if their appeal against a two-year ban from European competitions has been successful in the first half of July. The three-day hearing at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Lausanne ended yesterday  with the panel of arbitrators now beginning their deliberations. City were handed a two-season Champions League ban and ordered to pay a €30million fine after being found guilty of breaches of Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations and UEFA Club Licencing rules by the governing body’s Club Financial Control Body (CFCB).  That decision was made on February 14 and the Blues immediately made it clear they planned to appeal the decision to CAS. Over the last three days that hearing has taken place virtually as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Witnesses from various countries gave evidence via video conference, with the participants of UEFA and City watching on from Lausanne and London.
