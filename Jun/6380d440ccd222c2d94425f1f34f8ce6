 The FBN Holdings Plc (FBNH) has sold  its 65 per cent shares in FBN Insurance Limited to  Sanlam Emerging Markets (Proprietary) Limited (Sanlam). This confers the ownership of FBN Insurance (Life) and its subsidiary, FBN General Insurance Limited, on Sanlam. The deal, which was sealed via a Share Purchase Agreement (SPA), took effect from June 1. Group Managing Director, FBN Holdings Plc, U. K. Eke said: ‘’The divestment is in line with the Group’s medium to long-term strategic objectives. This will, ultimately, improve our shareholders’ well-being and deliver greater value to all the stakeholders.’’ Also, Sanlam Chief Executive Officer, Mr Heinie Werth, said: “Over the years we have enjoyed a mutually beneficial partnership with FBNH, and we will continue to cooperate with them in the future. Sanlam exercised its pre-emptive right to acquire the remaining shareholding of FBNI and in line with our partnership philosophy that underpins our business model, we will introduce local shareholding at an appropriate time in the future. This transaction is evidence of our belief and confidence in the value and future of the business, as well as the skilled management team and staff. Moreover, we are committed to Nigeria and view it as a key market on the continent.” The divestment, however, has no impact on FBN Insurance Brokers Limited as it remains a subsidiary of FBN Holdings.
