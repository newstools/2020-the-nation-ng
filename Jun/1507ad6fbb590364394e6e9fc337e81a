Partizan Belgrade of Serbia striker, Umar Sadiq, has been lined-up by French club-side, Lille as a like-for-like replacement for fellow Nigerian compatriot, Victor Osimhen. Lille boss Christophe Galtier on Friday made a confirmation that Super Eagles striker, Osimhen will leave the French team during this summer’s transfer window. “Regarding Victor and Gabriel, yes, I have known for a long time that they are leaving,” the French tactician said at a press conference which took place on Friday. And now, a report on top Italian sports site, calciomercato .com has revealed that Lille are already making serious plans to see that they sign Sadiq to replace Osimhen.  Rangers flop, Sadiq had earlier been lined up for a move to Manchester United after rebuilding his reputation with Partizan by scoring 17 goals and making 16 assists in 38 games this season. AC Milan, Valencia and Moscow rivals, CSKA and Spartak are also said to be on Sadiq’s trail. The Nigerian Under-23 international endured a miserable spell after joining Rangers from Roma in July 2018. Roma loaned Sadiq out to Bologna, Torino, NAC Breda, Gers, Perugia and Partizan. And the frontman’s goalscoring prowess prompted the Serbs to exercise their option to buy him in January. Kaduna-born Sadiq is under contract until 2022.
