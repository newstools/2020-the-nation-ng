Tension is brewing at the Bowen University, Iwo, Osun State over the sack of over 100 workers yesterday. A source at the institution told The Nation that letters of disengagement were sent to the affected workers via email on Tuesday night. The source said the school claimed that the economic crisis caused by COVID-19 pandemic was the reason for the retrenchment. One of the affected workers, who pleaded anonymity, told our reporter that the university sent sack letters to over 100 members of staff on Tuesday night “and this is generating tension on the campus now.” He said: “Over 100 of us are affected and we may resort to violence because the reason for the sack was not genuine. The Vice Chancellor, Prof Joshua Ogunwole, recently bought a vehicle worth over N42 million despite the economic situation. So you can see that it is caused by wickedness and insensitivity.” University spokesman Toba Adaramola confirmed that the institution sacked some workers. “Technology can take care of the duties of most workers that were sacked. So it is a way of sustaining the university so that it can maintain its status. There is no protest in the school,” he said.
