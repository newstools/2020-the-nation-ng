The Presidential Task Force (PTF) on the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic warned on Monday against reopening of schools and other activities of mass gatherings. The PTF also reminded Nigerians that there were still possibilities of a review of all relaxed measures, adding that relaxation of restrictions “does not mean carelessness and that life is back to normal”. Chairman of the PTF, Mr Boss Mustapha, who gave the warning, lamented the continued violation of measures put in place to curb the spread of the virus, including ban on inter-state travel. Some states have indicated plans to reopen some activities that encourage mass gatherings. In this category are Cross River State, which has reopened public schools, Oyo State which will open schools at the end of the month and Kano State, which allows the opening of football viewing centres as professional football leagues resume in Europe. Mustapha said: “We have received reports that some states are contemplating the reopening of schools, television viewing centres, sports stadia and other places where large gatherings could take place. “The PTF re-emphasises that it is not yet safe to do so and that utmost caution should be exercised. The PTF guideline, should still be complied with while considering decision of this nature”, he warned. He also raised concerns over the blatant disregard for guidelines, measures and regulations across the country, reminding the nation that the relaxed measures were still subject to review.
