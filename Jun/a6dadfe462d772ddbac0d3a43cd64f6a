Al-Mu’minaat Organisation has blamed the family institution for the spate of rape cases in the country. The women group called on parents to take the upbringing of their male children seriously, “as it is the male children who are improperly trained that are on the rampage, violating the women in the nation.” The National Amirah of Al-Mu’minaat, Hajia Nimatullah Abdulquadir said the organisation was worried about the increasing incidence of violent rape cases, describing it as a “rape of the nation.” Hajia Abdulquadir said: “the raping and killing of girls and women is becoming a daily headline in our national news. Even religious houses are not spared. All parents with female children fear for the safety of their daughters. We are all guilty of this insanity going on. We all need to take a retrospect into how we might have contributed consciously or unconsciously to the evil Tsunami that is currently sweeping through our nation”. Hajia Abdulquadir said the shaming and blaming of rape victims or survivors was dangerous, warning those who accuse victims of being responsible for their ordeal to desist immediately. “No woman deserves to be raped, and while Islam encourages decent dressing, accusing victims of being responsible for rape because of their dressing or being in particular places at the time of the crime is a great injustice,” she said. She urged the law enforcement agencies and lawyers to ensure that the law takes its cause on offenders. “The police must put their expertise into use to track down offenders. Looking for volunteered information is not enough; forensic audit and other modern means should be used to track perpetrators. Organisations, both civil and religious should educate their members. The National Orientation Agency (NOA) should start educating the populace about this ugly trend and the need to protect the girl child,” she said.
