 FBNInsurance Limited has presented its 2019 audited Annual Report to its Board at the company’s e-Annual General Meeting (e-AGM) held in Lagos. At the AGM, the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, FBNInsurance Limited, Mr. Val Ojumah, stated that the company closed the year with positive results and also made prompt claims payment to customers. Reviewing the year’s performance, Ojumah said: “Our Gross Premium Written (GPW) rose to N37.63 billion, an increment of 45 per cent compared to the N25.98 billion achieved in 2018. Profit Before Tax (PBT) appreciated by 28 per cent from N6.13 billion in 2018 to N7.82 billion in 2019. “This performance can be attributed to the company’s sustained growth and continuous penetration into the retail segment of the industry. In the same vein, as a responsive and reliable insurer that keeps its promises, we promptly paid claims to our clients to the tune of N9.90 billion which is a 130 per cent increase from N4.31 billion paid in 2018. One of our primary objectives is to help people, businesses and communities get back on their feet when the unexpected happens. “Also, in demonstration of its commitment to its shareholders, we announced a dividend of 97k per share, representing a 49 per cent increase from 65 kobo that was declared in 2018. With this, FBNInsurance has consistently paid dividends to its shareholders since 2013.’’ The Board’s Chairman, Mrs. Adenrele Kehinde, ascribed the performance to the growth and sterling performance of the company, which was made possible through mining the “hidden treasures” in the retail life insurance market.
