Niger State has stated that it has expended N1.2 billion so far on COVID-19 activities. Of this amount, N410 million was spent on medicals and N795 million was spent for other interventions, including palliatives. Secretary to the Niger State Government Alhaji Ahmed Matane, who is the chairman of the state COVID-19 Task Force, stated these while fielding questions from members of the state House of Assembly. Matane and Commissioner of Health Dr. Muhammad Maikusidi spoke before the House of Assembly to explain the activities of the task force committee. Matane said the money expended so far was from the state government, insisting that the task force had not received any money from the Federal Government for COVID-19 funding. Matane explained that N410 million was expended on palliatives, N85 million for electricity subsidy and the remaining amount was expended for transportation of task force members, movement of patients from the local government centres to the isolation centres, provision of water, allowances for volunteers, security operatives, frontline workers and some members of the task force. The committee chairman explained that another amount of N290 million was expended for medicals to buy Protective Personal Equipment (PPEs), drugs, capacity-building for health workers, risk communication and travelling of health workers. The members of the House of Assembly accused the committee of acting solo and not carrying the people along in what they have been doing. The member representing Lavun Constituency, Ndagi Baba, stated that none of the people of his constituency received any palliatives from the government.
