Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær  said Odion Ighalo has to  finish what he started at old Trafford as Manchester United agreed to extend the load deal of the Nigerian striker  till January 2021, Solskjaer said, when he appeared as a special guest on MUTV Group Chat that he hopes Ighalo can win trophy with his dream club. The manager said: “They [Shanghai Greenland Shenhua] have been great towards us, allowing him to play for his dream club. It’s been a dream for him and hopefully he can finish what he started and win a trophy with us.” Manchester United yesterday formally reached agreement with Shanghai Greenland Shenhua to extend the loan deal for Ighalo. The Nigerian striker’s stay was initially due to end on May 31, but he will now remain with the Reds until 31 January 2021, enabling him to build on an impressive start to life with the club he supported as a boy. Ighalo’s tally of four goals in eight appearances so far includes at least one strike in each of his three starts – against Club Brugge, Derby County (2) and LASK. Yesterday’s confirmation is a timely boost for United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, as he continues to prepare his squad for this month’s resumption of competitive football. The Premier League’s proposed return date is 17 June and the Emirates FA Cup quarter-finals have been lined up for the weekend of 27 and 28 June. Ighalo will now hope to pick up from where he left off, after winning United’s Goal of the Month award for March with a stunning strike in our last match, the impressive 5-0 victory over Austrian club LASK in the Europa League.
