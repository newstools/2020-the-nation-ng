According to the firm, this campaign is driven by largely focusing on penetrative behavioral change models in partnership with local organizations that have unique expertise in community mobilization and who are able to work seamlessly in some of the communities where Coca-Cola’s beverages are consumed daily. It said the Coca-Cola System in Nigeria under its World Without Waste campaign has thrived through several strategic partnerships structured around 3 pillars – Design, Collect and Partner.The Design pillaris centered around how Coca-Cola is investing in innovation to build a better package and explore packaging-free alternatives for delivering our products to consumers. The Collect Pillar seeks to reduce waste by collecting the same amount of packaging it sells for reuse, help communities identify and better understand their existing recycling and collection challenges; motivate consumers to recycle their packages and create a viable supply of reusable materials while the Partner pillar speaks to working together to support a healthy, debris-free environment and oceans through driving industry collaboration. This is why Coca-Cola is championing an industry collaboration known as Food and Beverage Recycling Alliance (FBRA), a registered Producer Responsibility Organization driving Food and Beverage packaging recovery in Nigeria.
