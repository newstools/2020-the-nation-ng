In recognition of the supreme sacrifice she paid during the March 15 Abule-Ado multiple blasts, the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) on Thursday named a newly built 500-capacity assembly hall after the late principal of Bethlehem Girls College, Sr. Henrietta Alokha. NAF which also built a cenotaph for her at the 041 NAF Communications Depot, Shasha, said it found the late Alokhaâ€™s action worthy of celebration and a huge inspiration to the younger generation on selfless service. Unveiling the cenotaph and the name, Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar said a hall in a school where character was moulded deserved to be named after a worthy Nigerian who has distinguished his/herself in the service to humanity. Abubakar was represented by Air Officer Commanding (AOC) Logistics Command, Air Vice Marshal (AVM) Lawal Alao.
