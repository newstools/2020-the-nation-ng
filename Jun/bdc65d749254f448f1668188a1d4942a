Dradrock Real Estate Limited, a Lagos based real estate development company, has unveiled a five-man board of directors that will take the organisation to the next level. The board was formally introduced at a brief media event, which took place last week at Dradrock’s corporate office in Lekki, Lagos. The Managing Director of the company, Oladipo Idowu-Agida, explained that the primary goal of this new line of action was to institutionalize every aspect of quality corporate governance in the organisation. The board is ultimately responsible for ensuring that the company complies with legal and regulatory obligations. Idowu-Agida said one fact he has taken away from vast entrepreneurship training is that when building a sustainable business, the company must have a life of its own to grow one key element that nurtures and sustains a business is corporate governance. He said “when we started Dradrock, our goal was to build an indigenous company that will grow a multinational organisation with a board that will develop a process that ensures growth and sustainability. Leading the board as Chairman is Engr. Abimbola Odubiyi, an electrical engineer of over 20 years with extensive experience in the power industry operations. He has worked for Powergen Uk, the Ibadan and Yola Electricity distribution companies in various capacities. Others on the board include Mr. Obabori Peter Olusola and Dr. Henrietta Onwugbuzie.
