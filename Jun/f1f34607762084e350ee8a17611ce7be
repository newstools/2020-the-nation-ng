 GREAT Nigeria Insurance Plc has partnered the Ogun State Security Trust Fund (OSTF)  as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives, its Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Mrs. Cecilia O. Osipitan, has said. According to her, the company supported the OSTF, through donations, to secure the lives and properties of indigenes and residents of the state. Mrs Osipitan, in a statement, said  the company’s donation was in fulfillment of the organisation’s resolve to support causes that would help create a safer and better society. She said: “The partnership with the government is focused on ensuring that the desired security stance is maintained within the state and its environs. The donation was also informed by the need to boost the Security Fund’s operation, as security is very essential to economic development, considering the fact that no investor will commit funds into an unstable economy characterised by lawlessness, disorderliness and chaos. “We are reaffirming our continuous support to the OSTF in actualising its main objective, which is to maintain the security and welfare of citizens in building a safe community.” She commended the Ogun State Governor Prince Dapo Abiodun for providing an enabling environment for businesses, noting the improvement in security in the state.
