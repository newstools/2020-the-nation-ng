The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has fumigated a top-flight hospital in Enugu following the reported case of the death of an Anambra state oil magnate. The oil magnate was said to have died of complications suspected from COVID-19 infection. Although the hospital was not shut down, its management was advised by the state Ministry of Health to offer only skeletal services for the meantime. Following the advice, the hospital no longer admits patients but only attends to outpatients. All others on admission have been discharged. Commissioner for Health Dr. Ikechukwu Obi added that the patient, who tested positive at the hospital, died before the result could come out.
