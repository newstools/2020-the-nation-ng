The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) has put on hold its recruitment process over the raging COVID 19 pandemic. However, the NSCDC said those who applied for vacant positions in the organisation have hope as the process was yet alive. The Corp’s Commandant General, Abdullahi Gana Muhammadu. disclosed these in a statement by his Media Assistant, Ekunola Gbenga, at the weekend. The NSCDC boss however warned that fraudsters have been sending messages to members of the public to attend interviews and training. The NSCDC noted that the activities of some fraudulent persons using various dubious means ranging from text messages, social media platforms and forged letters to invite unsuspecting members of the public for job interviews in a purported recruitment exercise by the Corps have come to its notice. “In the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, NSCDC, our top priority is the wellbeing of our country and community. “We are monitoring the ongoing Coronavirus (COVID-19) situation and are continuing to follow the latest Government advice. “To keep everyone as safe as possible, we have decided to put on hold our recruitment process but all shortlisted applications remain ‘live’,” said the agency. It added that whenever such an exercise is imminent, members of the public would be duly informed via its official website, www.nscdc.gov.ng, and national dailies. It maintained that its recruitment process is without a third party, “hence anyone who claims to be operating in such capacity on behalf of the Corps is a fraudster.”
