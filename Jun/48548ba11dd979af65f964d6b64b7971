Investors increased their stakes on Nigerian equities by 74.45 per cent with nearly one-thirds of the transactions on three of Nigeria’s largest banks. Investors staked N23.55 billion on quoted equities at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) last week, 74.45 per cent above N13.50 billion recorded in the previous week. A total of N6.94 billion, representing about 29.5 per cent of the total turnover value was staked on the trio of Guaranty Trust Bank (GTBank), FBN Holdings and Zenith Bank Plc. GTB is Nigeria’s most capitalised bank. Zenith Bank is the second most capitalised bank while FBN Holdings is the holding company for Nigeria’s oldest bank, First Bank of Nigeria (FBN) Limited. Market pundits attributed the large-volume transactions on the three first tier banks to investors seeking safe haven from industry and macroeconomic headwinds noting that the three banks are widely regarded as safest havens in the industry. Nigeria’s largest financial institution, GTBank, posted pre-tax profit of N58.2 billion within the first three months of this year. Key extracts of the unaudited three-month report for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 showed that GTBank’s profit before tax rose from N56.98 billion in first quarter 2019 to N58.20 billion in first quarter 2020. After taxes, net profit also improved from N49.30 billion in first quarter 2019 to N50.07 billion in first quarter 2020. Earnings per shares increased from N1.74 in first quarter 2019 to N1.77 in first quarter 2020. Net interest income had risen from N58.22 billion to N64.28 billion, counterbalancing the decline in net fee and commission incomes, which dropped from N18.01 billion to N13.55 billion. GTB paid N82.4 billion to shareholders as cash dividends for the 2019 business year, representing a dividend per share of N2.80. Zenith Bank recorded profit before tax of N58.8 billion in first quarter 2020 as against N57.3 billion recorded in comparable period of first quarter 2019. Gross earnings rose to N166.8 billion in first quarter 2020 against N158.1 billion recorded in first quarter 2019.

While most analysts believed that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic might moderate the performance of banks and other companies in the second quarter, they agreed that the leading banks are better positioned to wade through the crisis.
