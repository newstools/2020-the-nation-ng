Stallion Group Nigeria has launched a one-stop-for-all vehicle activities portal for its customers. Tagged, Stallion Africar Multi-brand Auto sales Portal, the company said it was aimed at maximising consumer loyalty across the country. According to Stallion Group General Manager, Marketing, Arpita Roy Luthra, the auto giant believed that a sizable business will be brought in through digital initiatives as consumers are still skeptical of stepping into showrooms to scout for their car of dreams. She said: “Stallion Africar will help meet customer expectations during the COVID era. The portal – www.stallionafricar.com – will also provide the customers with tools to make an informed decision on the choice of car in their budget and a virtual relationship, manager to guide them through the chat functionality. “It  offers an opportunity to do cross-selling and upselling and reduce their dependence on driving walk-in traffic to the point of sale. The simple design of Stallion Africar enables the consumer to take a decision on buying a new car and servicing their existing car. It’s soon adding the feature of buying a preowned car where the consumer can get their old car evaluated and uploaded to get the best deal and exchange it for a new.” The portal navigates through each of the top selling auto brands of Hyundai, Honda, Nissan, Porsche, and Changan. Each brand’s highlight model is displayed on the home page with the portal navigating to a detailed page containing specification, price and the consumer’s ability to book a test drive for their favourite car just at the push of a button. The car is brought in to customer’s home or workplace keeping the safety and hygiene measures in mind for the test drive to conform with social distancing guidelines to the maximum. She added that the portal allows customers access to compare features, aesthetics and price across major brands and models to arrive at the best decision. The relationship does not end at buying the ideal car.
