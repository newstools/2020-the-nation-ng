The North’s chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has warned the leadership of the Fulani herdsmen, under the aegis of Miyetti Allah, to desist from what it called reckless statements that can fuel a crisis in the country. It urged security agencies to invite the National President of Miyetti Allah, Alhaji Bello Abdullahi Badejo, over a statement credited to him that Nigeria belongs to Fulani which will rule the country forever. In a statement by its Vice Chairman, Rev. John Joseph Hayab, Northern CAN said Nigeria does not belong to any ethnic group, section or religion but to all Nigerians. It noted that Miyetti Allah’s statement that ‘Nigeria belongs to Fulani and they will rule forever’ “confirms and identifies those who do not wish Nigeria to live in peace and unity”. But last night, Badejo refuted the statement credited to him. He said his reaction was to the establishment of regional security outfits, to which he said Fulani herdsmen did not feel intimidated. Also, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youths, the youth wing of Igbo umbrella socio-cultural body, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, in a statement by its Deputy National President, Dr Kingsley Dozie, Ohanaeze Youths said: “The 1978 Land Use Act was crystal clear that any land usage that doesn’t come with the express permission from a state governor is illegal.” “Their claim of having free rights to any part of the country is very misleading, except they’re planning to force a total breakdown of law and order in Nigeria.” “All lands within our territory belongs exclusively to us, and our governors are the legitimate caretakers. “This threat and rhetoric from the Miyetti Allah’s boss is grossly inappropriate, and any attempt to effect any of those things he said anywhere in Igbo land would be vibrantly resisted by us.”
