An export stakeholder has called on importers to look inward and diversify to exporting non-oil commodities globally. The Chief Executive Officer, Free On Board (FOB) Global Logistics Limited, Mr. Jimmy Adebakin, who made this known to The Nation said this would move the economy on the path of growth. Adebakin said travel agents would immediately start earning revenue and commissions again while they wait for passengerâ€™s flights to resume globally. He stated that its collaboration with SABRE- a provider of innovative technology solutions for the travel industry, would help travel agents that have lost 100 percent of revenue.
