 OMOTOLA Jalade Ekeinde’s son, Captain E, has released a new music after the actress announced her readiness to embrace music again. The singer and producer released his second single in 2020 after promising to keep dishing out more music in 2020. Entitled ‘craze,’ the new song was released earlier in the week. According to a terse statement from Captain E, the new song talks about a never-ending cycle of a modern toxic relationship. The new single is coming a few weeks after the release of ‘You & I’ in May 2020. In July 2013, Captain E graduated with a Bachelor’s in Communication and media studies with an honors degree from Eastern Mediterranean University in Cyprus.
