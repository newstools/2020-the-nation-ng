A 43-year-old man who has speech and hearing challenges has been picked up by police in the Igando area of Lagos for allegedly raping his daughter aged 13. Muritala Owolabi Bakare, who can read and write, appeared remorseful as he responded to questions. “I am sorry about my activities, I rape my daughter, I have learnt some lesson, rape is bad,” he wrote on a piece of paper at Igando police station yesterday. Divisional police officer Taiwo Kasumu said the “matter has been charged to court for prosecution”.
