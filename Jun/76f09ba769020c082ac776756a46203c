The Olowo of Owo, Oba Gbadegesin Ogunoye III, has praised his subjects living abroad who helped to raise over N10m for the poor and vulnerable persons in his domain to help cushion effects of COVID-19 pandemic. Speaking while distributing the cash to the beneficiaries, Oba Ogunoye III said philanthropic gestures was the pivot of service to humanity and the real essence of life. The fund was contributed by the World Council of Owo Associations (WOCOA) in the United States of America. WOCOA is a non-profit and non-governmental organization, consist Owo indigenes in eight different associations resident in eight different cities across the United States of America. The Owo monarch commended the Owo indigenes in the USA for assisting to help the poor back home during this COVID-19 pandemic. According to him, â€œThis is the 11th or 12th time we are doing this. It is quite satisfactory that our people who are based in USA have decided to help their brothers and sisters back home. There is no reason some people will have in abundance and will not be able to assist others, particularly this period. President of WOCOA, Mr Idris Adeniseun said the effects of the global pandemic necessitated the need for the organization to present the monetary gift to help alleviate the burden created by the lockdown and other restrictions that made daily bread a hardship for many people worldwide.
