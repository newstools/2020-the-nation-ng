Simon, who recently signed a permanent deal with the canaries until June 2024 from Spanish side Levante, was also adjudged as the best player of the 2019/2020 season. On June 16, the French side had given its supporters the opportunity to elect their “Best XI of the decade”. For each position, the fans were offered several players who have marked the club during its last ten seasons. At the end of voting which was decided by more than 5,000 voters, Simon and a defender, Nicolas Pallois were the only members of the current Nantes squad that made the list. The Nigeria international got a total of 69% of the votes, while Vincent Bessat (Apollon Limassol) recorded 38 % in the “Wingers of the Decade” position. It is indeed multiple joy for the 24-year-old Simon, whose goal against Nice this past season was rated among the top goals in the French Ligue 1 for the past decade. His effort was rated No 25 best goal of the past 10 years in France. He was one of the club’s star performers, before the season ended prematurely due to the coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, Simon is excited for being named in Nantes’ team of the decade: “This season is surely my best season ever if I looked back and see what I have achieved so far and what God has done for me and my family. “I am very happy to be named in Nantes’ Team of the Decade. It’s quite a huge house. This will surely propel me to work harder to achieve more in the coming seasons,” Simon said.
