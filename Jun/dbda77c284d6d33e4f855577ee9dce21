 CRC Credit Bureau has unveiled its Data Submission Application Programming Interface (API) that enables institutions access and submit data on their credit customers online real time. This innovation, the first in the industry, is an automated medium that enables institutions, provide CRC with information on credits  immediately they are booked on the system and update existing credit records as soon as repayments have been made by their customers. The API also enables them to access relevant information about their customers through live connections. The Managing Director/CEO of CRC Credit Bureau Limited, ‘Tunde Popoola, said: “We are always listening to our customers, individuals and institutions alike, and during the restriction of movement, zone overarching challenge was the need to have an automated means of accessing and submitting data 24/7. ‘’As a data company, we should ensure that beyond just providing credit data, our customers are able to access and submit data as efficiently as possible. We know that timely data reporting is essential to the quality of data which ultimately increases access to finance and postpaid products for consumers and businesses. Consequently, our Data Submission API makes this process more efficient and effective for all parties involved.’’
