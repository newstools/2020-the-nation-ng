 LAW enforcement agents in Nigeria have been urged to avoid the use of force when dealing with unarmed civilians, and ensure that they adhere strictly to the provisions of the law in carrying out routine assignments. These pleas were made by the Commissioner of Police (CP) in charge of the Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad (FSARS) Fiminhan Adeoye at a workshop on “Proportionality and De-escalation of Crisis” organised for operatives of the Lagos State State Rapid Response Squad (RRS) on Thursday. The workshop which held at the state secretariat, Alausa at the instance of RRS Commander DCP Olatunji Disu, also had in attendance the Executive Secretary, Lagos State Security Trust Fund (LSSTF) Abdulrazaq Balogun and Chief Lecturer, Nigerian Institute of Journalism, Jide Johnson. Fiminhan said policemen must gauge their actions in the course of their policing duties to avoid dire consequences. He told them to embrace more of dialogue and persuasive appeals which he said would achieve more results easily and by extension, endear them in to the hearts of the populace rather than the use of force. He cautioned the police officers against using armed and unarmed forces without considering the proportionality, legality accountability and necessity (PLAN) of such actions as enshrined in police Revised Force Order 237. “You must have exhausted all the non-violent means like dialogue before resorting to the use force and arms. You must also know when to cease to use force and arms. “
