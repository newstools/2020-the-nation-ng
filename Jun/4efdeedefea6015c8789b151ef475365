Pinnick  said that the federation has received the fund from FIFA while NFF is expecting $200,000 from CAF being the annual statutory fund from CAF to football federation across the continent.  He said:  “We were quite explicit in official press statements with regards to monies we have received from FIFA and how it would be expended. We sought the advice of FIFA on the utilization of the monies and we have done accordingly. “A few days ago, we received a circular from the Confederation of African Football (CAF) on the imminence of the sum of $200,000 into our accounts. This money is our annual statutory funds from CAF and not anything special, though it is coming earlier this year,” he added.

He added that the federation hopes to use the solidarity funds from FIFA and sponsorship funds to boost the Nigeria National League (NNL) and Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL).
