The group’s Coordinator, Eze Chika Diabia Jumbo, in a statement by the Secretary, Mazi Onyebuchi Eze, said its formation was to reciprocate the governor’s love for the non-indigenes, especially the Igbo. The body described Governor Sanwo-Olu as a gentleman, detribalised, humble, sincere in his dealings, forward looking, honest and inspiring with a sense of mission. It pledged its support for the Sanwo-Olu administration.
