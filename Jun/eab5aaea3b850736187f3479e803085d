Nigeria has lost an intelligent politician. “I will forever remember Ajimobi as a man who was truly and deeply loved by his creator as evident in his very illustrious life as a professional, and in politics. This was a man who set records and broke records in terrains that many thought impossible, starting from a very humble background.  “From rising to the peak in his career, to successfully representing his people as a senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and finally becoming the first governor of Oyo state to win a second term, a feat which earned him the well-deserved Koseleri tag.” Akanbi stated Ajimobi brought infrastructural development to Oyo and will remain immortalised him in the hearts of the people. “His hard work and doggedness towards his goals will be remembered through the many elections he won and even in the few he lost. Possessing a good sense of humour, Senator Ajimobi lived life to the fullest; he freely expressed himself, leaving no one in doubt regarding his true feelings about issues,” he said.
