A former spokesman for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ondo State, Banji Okunomo, has urged delegates in the coming primaries to resist peanuts from any aspirant in exchange for their votes. Okunomo, a governorship aspirant in the PDP, assured the delegates that he would not disappoint them if elected as the party’s candidate. Speaking through his Director of Media and Publicity, Akinrinlola Olumide, Okunomo said the October 10 governorship poll would be a generational shift to put the state on a new pedestal of hope and development. He said he would guarantee equitable and reasonable participation of classes of people in the society in line with best practices in modern day democracy. Said he: “The majority of the delegates are in my generation. They are mostly youths like me. Our women can also see that I am very sensitive about gender equality to end discrimination against them. “The formation of my campaign structure from the ward to the local government and state levels, which involves youths, women and elders, is a proof that I am in this race to provide good governance with the formation of a government that will guarantee equitable and reasonable participation of classes of people in the society, including elders, youths and women in line with best practices in modern day democracy. “The delegates should not be distracted by peanuts. I urge them to support me so that we can work together to rescue Ondo State from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and create an enabling environment for development.”
