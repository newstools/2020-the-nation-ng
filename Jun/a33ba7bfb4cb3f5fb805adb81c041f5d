 A WOMAN identified as Cynthia Obieshi was found dead clad in her undies on Sunday morning in a private hostel room between Nekede and Ihiagwa communities in Owerri West council of Imo State. Also found dead in the kitchen was a man, Samuel Ezeji, dressed only in boxer shorts. A source said the man came in on Saturday night with the lady. Police said they saw a foamy substance in her mouth when they forced the door open upon receiving a call that “some people had a problem here”. The hostel is rented mostly by students of Federal Polytechnic Nekede, it was said. Police confirmed the incident, adding that the couple may have ingested a hard drug.
