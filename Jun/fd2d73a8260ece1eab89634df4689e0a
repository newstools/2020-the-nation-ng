 DIRECTOR, Centre for Infectious Diseases Research, Bayero University, Kano, Prof. Isa Abubakar has raised concerns over the purported decline in the number of COVID-19 infected persons in Kano State, describing it as not the true reflection of the situation. Abubakar cautioned that the decline was not in any way a sign of relief on the spread of COVID 19. He spoke when the centre received a new COVID-19 testing machine donated by A.A. Rano and Aliko Oil. He alleged that the state was not submitting the number of required samples for testing on the disease. While inaugurating a test collection centre in the state, Governor Abdullahi Ganduje had expressed satisfaction over the low active cases, which he described as a significant indication that the state is winning the battle against COVID-19.
