 Residents of Ilutitun-Osooro, an agrarian community in Okitipupa Local Government Area of Ondo State, have sent a Save Our Soul (S.O.S) message to Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu over the flood ravaging the community. The development followed the recent downpour. The rains have rendered people homeless, with property worth millions of Naira destroyed. The affected areas include houses along Union Bank Road, Akinyemi and Agidi streets, extending to Seba Olawole Street along Ilutitun-Osooro Broad Street. One of the victims, who spoke on behalf of others, who gave her name as Mrs. A. Idebi, said the incessant rains that caused flood had wreaked havoc on them, rendering them homeless.  “At this Coronavirus pandemic period, we are imploring Governor Akeredolu to help us because we are suffering,” she said. The local government Chairman, Omoba Abayomi Adesanya, assured the residents of government’s support. He said they would continue to enjoy the dividends of democracy. Adesanya enjoined the people to always clear drainages in front of their homes, to ensure free water passage. He appealed to Governor Akeredolu to assist the local government in combating flood.
