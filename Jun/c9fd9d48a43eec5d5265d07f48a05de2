Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will reportedly  play Paul Pogba as an attacking midfielder to accommodate Bruno Fernandes’ role in the side. The potential midfield partnership has been one of the talking points ahead of the Premier League’s resumption next week. Fernandes has made a stunning impact following his arrival, winning the top flight’s Player of the Month award in February. After struggling for midfield creativity earlier this season, the pair’s potential partnership is much anticipated for a United side that entered football’s shutdown on an 11-match unbeaten streak. And, according to The Sun, Solskjaer has a definitive plan to fit the two players into his plans.  France star Pogba will be moved into a No.10 role to allow Fernandes to operate deeper, the newspaper said. Solskjaer has already hinted that he intends to field the pair in his side if he can. He said in May: “Good players can always play together, so definitely, they can – it’s a big yes.” Meanwhile, Solskjaer has said his fully-fit squad have adapted well to the training changes recently adopted by the Premier League.
