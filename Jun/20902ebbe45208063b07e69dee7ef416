Villarreal manager Javi Calleja has labelled Nigeria winger Samuel Chukuweze a complete player. Chukwueze was named man-of-the-match in Villarreal’s 1-0 home win against Real Mallorca on Tuesday and provided the assist for Carlos Bacca’s winning goal. He was named the club’s young player of the season last term after contributing five goals in 26 outings. The 21-year-old has scored three goals and recorded four assists in 29 league appearances for the Yellow Submarine this season.  The pacy winger has also attracted European big guns with the likes of Liverpool and Chelsea reportedly interested in his services. Calleja reckoned that Chukwueze has what it takes to become a top footballer in future. “We’ve worked a lot and Samu is a very complete player. If he continues on this path, he’ll become a really top footballer,” Calleja declared.
