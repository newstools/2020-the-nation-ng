 The only female governorship aspirant in the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ondo State, Mrs. Jumoke Anifowose, has given reasons why members should elect her as their candidate. She said she laid the foundation of the APC in the state when she served as chairman of the defunct Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) by wooing many people into the party. Speaking with The Nation,  Anifowose said many political juggernauts in the APC joined the party because of her presence.  She said she visited many aggrieved members in their homes, adding that those who had already joined the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) returned to the party (APC). On whether she would step down for any consensus candidate,  Anifowose said she would not step down for any arrogant aspirant. She denied using her late father’s name (Michael Adekunle Ajasin) to gain political favours.
