Support groups for the re-election of Ondo State Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu have contributed N35million for the purchase of the All Progressives Congress (APC) nomination and expression of interest forms. The price of the forms has been pegged at N22million. Members of the support groups include lawmakers in the House of Assembly; members of Ibi Giga Ambassadors; Ibigiga Aketi Advocacy Group; Sunshine Vanguard Group; Students Group; Road Transport Employers’ Association of Nigeria (RTEAN); Pentagon Movement, South Africa; Aketi Mandate Group; Aketi Women Group; Aketi Vision 2020; Democratic Pathfinders; Eka Merin Youth Alliance; Aketi One 2 One; Ose Aketi 4+4; Non Indigene Forum and others. A former Speaker of the House of Assembly, Mr. Victor Olabintan, who presented the N22million cheque on behalf of other groups, said they contributed the money towards the re-election of the governor because of his performances. He said they contributed the money since the governor said he does not have the N22million being demanded by the APC to buy the forms.
