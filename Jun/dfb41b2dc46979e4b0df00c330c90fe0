A governorship aspirant of the All Progressives Congress, Hon Isaacs Kekemeke, has said that move to secure peace within the party by Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu was not to allow for his second term. Kekemeke stated that Governor Akeredolu four years term will end in February, 2021 He said other aspirants should step down for him because he is the most popular, the most competent and the only aspirant present on ground. Speaking in interview with journalists in Akure, Kekemeke noted they seeking peace within the ruling party was not about the forth coming gubernatorial contest. He said the absence of peace in the party was not because he and others were aspiring to be governor. His words, “What we are saying is that the Governor has a four years certain tenure and it comes to an end by February and a process for a new tenure begins. “Like he did contest against other people, this seat is open for as many people to contest both at the primary level and at the general election level. He is the Chief Security Officer of this state; he has a duty at all times to make peace. That is his job. “We will work with him to make that peace but that does not mean compromising our individual aspirations. I am going to be Governor after Akeredolu. “Other aspirants should step down for me. I am the most popular. I am the most competent. I am the only one present on ground. The people know me. They should work with me. The Governor has done four years, it is now my time.”
