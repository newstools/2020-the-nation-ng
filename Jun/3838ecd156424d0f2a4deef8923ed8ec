 NIGERIA and other countries  willing to compete in the  track and field events for the Tokyo 2021 Olympic Games have been given till June 29, 2021 to qualify for the world’s biggest sporting bonanza holding in Japan. The new updated and revised qualification process for the postponed Tokyo Olympics has been confirmed by the World Athletics following the worldwide coronavirus outbreak. Following the reopening of its headquarters in Monaco this week, World Athletics President Sebastian Coe also announced a new strategic plan to drive growth in the aftermath of the pandemic, particularly as it impacts on athletes returning to training and competition. As previously agreed, the main Tokyo qualification principles remain unchanged: qualification through entry standards (which also remain unchanged) and then world rankings. Athletes who have already met the entry standard since the start of the qualification period in 2019 remain qualified, with other athletes to qualify within the extended qualification period. There also remains a suspended qualification period for all events from April 5th until November 30th 2020. For all other events, the entry standards period is May 1st 2019 to April 5th 2020, and December 1st 2020 to June 29th 2021 (18 months); and the world rankings period is June 30th 2019 to April 5th 2020, and December 1st 2020 to June 29th 2021 (16 months).
