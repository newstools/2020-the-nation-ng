 Lagos State Electricity Board (LSEB) has begun energy audit of state-owned facilities. A statement yesterday by the General Manager, Mukhtaar Tijani, said the audit was part of plans to  develop the state’s comprehensive energy master plan to improve energy efficiency and sustainability. Tijani described the proposed master plan as a detailed layout of energy sources, distribution, consumption and management towards the development of a reliable and sustainable standard of energy to serve government facilities. According to him, the agency has begun energy assessment of government facilities. The first phase of audited state-owned health facilities comprise 316 primary health centres (PHCs), 26 general hospitals and one teaching hospital in the 57 local government areas and local council development areas. Tijani said that based on the energy demand of each health care facility, LSEB would develop feasible energy solutions integral for the success of the facility’s medium and long-term energy needs. He added that plans are on to audit other government facilities, including educational, waste management, water corporation, sports centres, theatres and cinemas, adding that government is poised to provide off-grid electrification that is clean and sustainable. “In line with the T.H.E.M.E.S Agenda of the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration, energy is a key tool in rapid socio-economic development of this megacity. The proposed energy solutions will establish a new direction of growth. “This move will ultimately provide government a broad analysis of the energy strength in the state with possible and most important response to management that is in conformity with the growing exigency for reduction in energy levels within our environment,” Tijani said. He added that the state requires the transition to a less carbon intensive economy, which will provide a healthier environment for social and business activities.
