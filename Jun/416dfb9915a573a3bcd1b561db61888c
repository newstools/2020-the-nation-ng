 THE war against Covid-19 pandemic is the second time in the history of Nigeria we are fighting a common enemy in a very united form. The first was the independence struggle championed by Nigerian nationalists. Just like the movement for national liberation, Nigeria is united in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic, shoving all ethnic and tribal sentiments out of the way. The lock-down in some places and limited movement in some others enabled families and communities to bond and support one another, reflecting the lyrics of the great song “Lean On Me”, originally by Bill Withers and later by Michael Bolton. The fraternity at families and communities is a nuisance value of Cs occasioned by the dreaded Covid-19. One of the important lessons from the Covid-19 pandemic is that the world is a global village, informing the speed with which the virus travelled to every corner of the globe. We are one-humanity, and the beauty of the world is in the diversity of its people. Narrow it home to Nigeria; we are one people, one nation, one destiny. No matter your tribe and religious leaning, we are one, and should remain united.. Another nuisance value of the Covid-19 pandemic is that nations are looking inwards for solutions.  The major lesson is that nations should strive to be self-reliant especially in the agriculture and health sectors. Until the discovery of oil in Nigeria in 1958, agriculture was the mainstay of the country’s economy with different regions boasting of different cash crops. Today, with the expanse land and over 180 million people, Nigeria cannot feed its citizens not to talk of exporting to other lands.
