 Candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) in the 2016 governorship election in Ondo State, Eyitayo Jegede, will not be running mate to anybody, one of his aides has said. There were talks that the PDP national leadership has reached a deal with Deputy Governor, Agboola Ajayi, for Jegede to be his running mate on condition that he serve only one term.  But a close aide to Jegede who pleaded anonymity said his boss has denied entering such agreement. The aide stated that Jegede was sure of victory at the PDP primary and main election.
