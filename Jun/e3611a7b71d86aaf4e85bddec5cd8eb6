The Lagos State Inland Revenue Service (LIRS) generated N25 billion through taxation in April despite the total lockdown, the head of its Information and Communication (ICT) Department, Mr. Rasheed Olu-Ajayi, said on Saturday. Olu-Ajayi told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that the service was able to achieve the feat by leveraging on technology. He said that though the revenue invoked was not good enough, it was better than starting from ground zero taking into cognisance the total lockdown. “What we did was to have a business continuity plan by documenting product, events with which we continue to work,” he said. “So, we invoked technology tools, with lots of our staff, working from home but chasing taxpayers. “We were able to invoke a good amount of money, not a case of ground zero,’’ he said.
