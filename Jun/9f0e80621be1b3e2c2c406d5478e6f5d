 ABIA State Governor Okezie Ikpeazu has announced that he, his deputy, Dr. Udo Okochukwu and other members of the state executive council  (EXCO) will be undergoing a COVID-19 test. Others that will undergo the same test, according to the governor, are members of the Inter-ministerial committee on COVID-19. A statement issued yesterday by Information Commissioner Chief John Okiyi-Kalu  stated that the decision was necessitated by the outcome of tests conducted on close family of a late exco member and member of the Inter-ministerial committee on COVID-19, Dr. Solomon Ogunji, who died last Sunday. Ogunji was said to have died at the Abia State Teaching Hospital (ABSUTH), Aba of hypertension. However, a statement by the state government reportedly sparked fears among the people who came in contact with the late Commissioner for Environment some weeks and days before his death. The commissioner’s statement reads: “Following the outcome of tests conducted on close family members of a late member of the state executive council (Exco) and member of the Inter-ministerial committee on COVID-19, Abia State Governor, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu, has directed all members of the committee and those of the Exco, who might have recently come in contact with the late commissioner to immediately undergo COVID-19 tests and isolate themselves thereafter pending the outcome of the tests. “Governor Ikpeazu, who is still in mourning, will also subject himself to all other necessary protocols as he has directed his Exco members, including the deputy governor to do. “We wish to call on all Abians to continue to observe relevant regulations issued by the government and health authorities to stem the spread of the disease.”
