For the umpteenth time, President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Amaju Pinnick has insisted the German tactician, Gernot Rohr worked hard to earn the contract extension as Super Eagles coach. He also said that the federation is working tirelessly to name a new coach for the Super Falcons. Last week, NFF formally announced a new 60months contract extension for the former Bayern Munich defender. Pinnick told journalists in a media call yesterday that the federation was convinced that Rohr deserved a new deal as Eagles’ gaffer. “We are of the view and conviction that Mr. Gernot Rohr deserves to continue the job he is doing with the Super Eagles. I believe he has earned it. He had a right of first refusal so it was not a problem. We included a few other things in his contract but at the end of the day, we were able to come to an agreement,” the NFF boss said. He noted about the Super Falcons: ” We are working to see how we can hold the interview to select the new Head Coach for the Super Falcons. I have a meeting with our external auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers this week, on the need for us to get this done. “ Once we get the appearance money from the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup, we will hand over the 30 per cent that is the entitlement of the players and then ring-fence the balance for the purpose of paying the new Head Coach.” He added that the federation is awaiting $760,000 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup appearance from the world body, while the entire team would share 30 percent of the funds.
