Borussia Dortmund had Erling Haaland to thank as the Norwegian striker headed home an injury-time goal at Fortuna Dusseldorf to keep BVB’s Bundesliga title hopes alive. Haaland was brought on as a substitute just past the hour-mark, and scored with the last action of the game to seal a 1-0 victory for Dortmund – and BVB coach Lucien Favre appeared to injure himself celebrating the goal. The win lifts BVB to 66 points before leaders Bayern Munich – on 70 points with a game in hand – host Borussia Monchengladbach later on Saturday. Dortmund never hit top form and survived several scares before Raphael Guerreiro volleyed in just past the hour. His effort, however, was cancelled by a VAR review for handball. Fortuna, in the relegation playoff spot, twice hit the post through Steven Skrzybski, first in the 82nd minute with a low shot and eight minutes later again after breaking clear. But Haaland made sure of a last-gasp win when he rose high to connect with a Manuel Akanji cross – with the resulting celebrations seeing coach Favre seemingly injure his calf. Manchester United remain interested in signing Haaland despite missing out on him to Dortmund in January, though it is unclear if the teenager will be available during the summer transfer window.
