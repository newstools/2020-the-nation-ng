The Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare and the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) have paid glowing tributes to the departed matriarch of the Okwaraji family, Madam Jane Okwaraji, who died on May 23, 2020. The minister in a statement issued by his Special Adviser on Media, John Joshua- Akanji described the demise of Mrs. Okwaraji as a shock: “The death of Mrs. Okwaraji came to me with rude shock at a time when we had concluded plans for her monthly allowance. It is so sad and painful that she died when we had just visited her and placed her on a monthly welfare package. “She was such a strong and courageous woman who took the death of her son in her strides. Considering the circumstance of her son’s death, she exhibited a great spirit. May her soul rest in peace and may God console the family she left behind.” The NFF who were formally informed about the demise of Madam Okwaraji spoke through its Secretary General, Mohammed Sanusi, expressed the deep pain: “We are deeply pained to receive this notice of the passing of Mrs. Okwaraji. Only last month, we resolved to appreciate and support the noble gesture of the Hon. Minister by providing a further N30, 000 monthly stipend to the mothers of Samuel (Okwaraji) and Rashidi (Yekini). It is sad that Mrs. Okwaraji had to leave us at this time.” Meanwhile, the eldest son of the deceased, Patrick Okwaraji, said plans are afoot to organize a simple burial ceremony in accordance with the COVID-19 pandemic final rites protocols in Enugu State in about three weeks, with a bigger ceremony to hold after the pandemic experience.
