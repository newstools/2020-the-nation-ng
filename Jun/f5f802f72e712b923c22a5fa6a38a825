 COMEDIAN Oluwaseyitan ‘Seyilaw’ Lawrence has charged Governor Rotimi Akeredolu to prioritise health sector in Ondo State after the loss of his aunt. The comedian made this call after he lost his aunt to an automobile accident in his hometown, Ilaje. According to him, he is not fighting the state governor but urging him to come to the aid of the citizens by taking responsibility for their well-being. “Your Excellency, Barr. Rotimi Akeredolu, this is not a fight with you, it is just stating the truth,” he started in the video shared on his Instagram page. “This morning, my mum’s younger sister had an accident and they didn’t have the right equipment to take care of her at the General Hospital, Igokoda. And after a few minutes, she has been pronounced dead – just because she fractured her leg in an accident. “The tragedy today could have been avoided, but it is well. I have accepted my loss, but I will keep talking until I see reasonable changes.” The comedian, however, said that his protest is not politically motivated, but a wake-up call to the government. “If you think my plead is politically motivated, please go ahead, you have a right to your opinions, but posterity will be the judge of all.  “You can Google how I criticise the Ondo State during Mimiko’s tenure. I went as far as granting an interview with Saharareporters.”
