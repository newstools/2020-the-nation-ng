The mother of Barakat Omolara Bello, an 18-year-old student of Federal College of Animal Health and Production Technology, Moor Plantation in Ibadan, murdered by men, has asked God to expose the killers of her daughter within seven days. Mrs. Kafayat Bello spoke with BBC Yoruba at her Akinyele, Ibadan, Oyo state capital residence. According to the distraught mother, the killers of her daughter did not let Barakat fulfill her promises to uplift the poor family. “Only God knows how it happened. I was not at home. Some neighbours called me around 6pm. By the time I got home, I found my daughter in the pool of blood. I was shocked. “She took her phone to Kara for repair on Sunday and went to retrieve it on Monday around 2pm. Some people saw her around 5pm while returning home. “She later went to fetch water to take a bath. Those killers had stolen some things in our room. They met her on their way out through the backyard and attacked her. “Her younger one, who had gone to the Arabic class, was the one that alerted the neighbours when he found her in the pool of blood.” She described her late daughter as a precious child. “She made a lot of promises for me to turn our lives around because we are poor. They (the killers) did not make my daughter fulfil all her promises. “There is nothing people can do for me that would bring her back to life. But one thing I am asking Allah is whoever involves in the killing of my daughter be exposed before seven days,” she said.
