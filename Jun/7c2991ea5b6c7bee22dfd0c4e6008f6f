 THOSE eagerly awaiting the reopening of schools and lifting of bans on religious and social gathering in Oyo State may have to wait a bit longer as Governor Seyi Makinde said on Wednesday he is not in any haste to lift the ban without experts’ advice. He said such a decision will be premised on positive risk situation analysis presently being carried out by experts. This is coming as the governor said ‘Operation Amotekun’ will in the next one month begin operations following the screening and confirmation of the Brigadier-General Ajibola Togun (retd) and Colonel Bisiriyu Olayanju (retd) as chairman and commander of the corps respectively by the state assembly. Makinde gave the hint while delivering his “State of the State Address” during a special plenary to commemorate the first year anniversary of the Ninth State House of Assembly. The session, which was also attended by top government functionary was presided over by the Speaker of the house, Adebo Ogundoyin. On his achievements in the last one-year particularly in line with his four pillars “Roadmap for Accelerated Development in Oyo State, 2019-2023”, Makinde mentioned his efforts in fighting the novel coronavirus.
