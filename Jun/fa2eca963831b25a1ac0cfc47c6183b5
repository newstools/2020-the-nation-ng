 THE political face-off between Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, and his erstwhile deputy, Agboola Ajayi, isn’t about to end with the latter’s resignation last Sunday from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Instead, a fresh crisis has been ignited by Ajayi’s decision to remain in office as deputy governor while brandishing the membership card of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Sentry learnt it might not be possible for Akeredolu and the APC to get rid of Ajayi from his current seat. The APC has described his insistence on not resigning as vexatious. But the defiant Ajayi has said: “My people that voted for me did not ask me to resign as Deputy Governor, so I remain the Deputy Governor of this state. I was duly elected as a Deputy Governor.” Ongoing efforts by the governor and the party to get the House of Assembly to move against him are not yielding fruit as Ajayi is said to enjoy the sympathy of a good number of the lawmakers. “In fact, a couple of them are currently preparing to join him in the PDP. So, it may not be easy to use the assembly to remove him as some of our party leaders desire,” a source told Sentry. As it is Ajayi appears to be the proverbial bone in the throat of Akeredolu. Barring an unforeseen slip, the governor may have to make do with an opposition party member as his deputy for the rest of his term in office.
