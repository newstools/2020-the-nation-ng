FORMER four weight world champion Roberto Duran is in hospital having tested positive for coronavirus. Duran, 69, was taken to hospital as a precaution due to one of his lungs not functioning properly following a car crash in Argentina back in 2001. It led the legendary boxer to retire after a career that lasted more than 30 years. His diagnosis comes as his home nation of Panama set a new record for daily cases of Covid-19 with officials reporting over 1,000 cases for the preceding 24 hours along with 17 more deaths. Duran’s son, Robin, wrote on Instagram: “Test results have just arrived for my dad, and they confirm he is positive for Covid-19.  “He is not in intensive care nor on a respirator, just under observation. We’ll be passing on more information over the days. “The doctor tells us his lungs are fine and there are no signs of seriousness. Let’s continue to have faith that everything will turn out well.” Duran was world champion at lightweight, welterweight, light middleweight and middleweight, as well as reigns as the undisputed and lineal lightweight champion.
