Mainz 05 Nigerian striker Taiwo Awoniyi has described his side’s Saturday’s 2-0 win against Eintracht Frankfurt as a big morale booster in the fight for Bundesliga survival. Now in 15th position, Mainz  are just a step above relegation zone  but  the former junior international said victory away at Eintracht Frankfurt would put them in good stead for the remaining four games of the season. “It was an important victory for us and it will help us as a team moving forward,” the 22-year-old loanne from Liverpool told NationSport. “The focus is now is the next game because the point difference with the other teams in the relegation zone is not much. “The Bundesliga is a different ball game but we just have to fight for every point in the last four games so that we can keep our spot for next season.” Awoniyi who scored his first Bundesliga goal in the 2-2 draw against FC Koln in May, said he was more interested in the survival of his side  than personal crave  for goals: “The most important thing  is that I’m personally putting in my best but  the team comes first “Of course, the world only wants to hear about who scores; but the victory for my team is more important to me. “I enjoy scoring as well and I believe it will come again at the appointed time.” Meanwhile, Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr who saw a couple of Bundesliga games via television from his base in France on Saturday, applauded the duo of Awoniyi and Paderborn’s Jamilu Collins. Awoniyi and Collins played a successful match, playing very well technically and tactically and I think the victory for Mainz was important to stay in the Bundesliga,” noted  Rohr.
