Nigeria will not make any move towards convincing Arsenal teen star Bukayo Saka to switch allegiance to the team according to coach of the team Gernot Rohr. Saka is eligible to represent Nigeria as his parents are from the West African country but he is already a junior international for England hence will need a switch of allegiance process to be eligible for Nigeria. His form this season has led to talks about a possible call up to the senior national team of England as he has excelled for Arsenal despite their struggles this season. While speaking on what it takes to convince players born abroad to switch allegiance to the Super Eagles, Rohr said his approach is very straightforward as he is only focus on players who want to play for the team. “We have good players in several positions but we are still open to having more. For players who have already represented another country it’s not easy to have them cleared to play for Nigeria,” Rohr explained . “However we don’t beg any player. If they want to play they should call me to indicate their interest like Alex Iwobi, Ola Aina and Joe Aribo. It’s not the wise thing to beg them to play for Nigeria, we want players who are committed to making Nigerians happy,” he concluded.
