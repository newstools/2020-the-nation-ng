 THE Federal Ministry of Youths and Sports Development has said activities were on to explore all appropriate avenues to transform the classification of sports in the country from mere recreation to a profitable economic activity. The Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare told State House Correspondents said it was only in Nigeria where sports were seen as ‘play-play’. He spoke after the weekly virtual Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting, which was presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House in Abuja. He said the ministry has committedly worked to turn sports into an economic industry, where the country could generate billions of revenues. He further revealed that the ministry had signed Memoranda of Understanding with relevant organisations and held various inter-ministerial meetings with the sole aim of moving sports as an industry from a mere concept to pure economic action. “We realised when we came on bound that the National Bureau of Statistics still classified sports as a recreation. And when you look around from South Africa to Brazil even to Jamaica, sports is classified as business,” the minister said. “It is an economic activity. When you look at global statistics it’s a $1.33 trillion industry. “When you look at the United Kingdom, it is a $43 billion industry annually. In America, it is $41 billion annually. It is only this country that classifies sports as `play – play’ or recreation,” he noted.
