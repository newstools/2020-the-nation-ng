Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr said he has been  thrilled with the performance of Mainz’ Taiwo Awoniyi, Paderborn’s Jamilu Collins  and FC Koln’s Kingsley Ehizibue following the resumption of the German Bundesliga. The German who last week penned a new two-year contract extension with the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF)   to lead Super Eagles to the 2021 AFCON in Cameroon and 2020 World Cup in Qatar, expressed optimism that more Nigerian stars would feature for their various teams with the eagerly awaited return of action in the Spanish La Liga, Italian Serie A and English Premier League (EPL). “I am very happy that Bundesliga has already played four matches and all the Nigerian players of course can be watched,” Rohr told NationSport. “Players like Taiwo Awoniyi of Mainz; also the other ones especially those that had already made our team like Jamie Collins, who played in a difficult game at home Dortmund. “Collins played well in the match while Kingsley Ehizibue is also a regular for Koln. These are players that already reserved for Eagles.” He however, lamented the difficulties in convincing players of Nigeria descent plying their trade in the Bundesliga to pledge their loyalty to Super Eagles. He added: “Other Nigerians playing for Germany is very difficult to invite them for the moment because everybody must write a letter and agree, some processes to go through but I am happy that our football is working again and we are happy about it. “Already the La Liga, Series A and EPL will all start very soon. But I  am disappointed with French Lique 1 decision not to finish season like this because we have like five to six players in the league who need competition and don’t have such competition for six months and that it is a long time.”
