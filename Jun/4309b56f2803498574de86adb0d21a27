Members and leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ugele/Arokun ward Ekiti at the weekend passed a vote of confidence on Dr. Oluwole Olumayokun Oluyede, a chieftain of the party. At a meeting of the ward executives on June 26, 2020 at Ikere, Ekiti, members unanimously refused to suspend the APC chieftain but passed a vote of confidence on him reportedly against instruction of the state exco and Governor Kayode Fayemi. The Ugele/Arokun ward executives described Oluyede as a loyal and committed party member adding: “this he has showcased with his contribution to the building of our great party at all levels.” In a statement made available to the Nation, the ward executives also described the APC chieftain as one who has been forthright and consistently lead by example. “The man in question (Dr. Oluwole) has contributed immensely either morally or financially to the lives of many of APC members at all levels and at both ward, local, state and national at large. “Dr. Oluwole has not for once engaged in any anti-party activities or commits any unpardonable offence that warrants suspension,” the statement added. Party leaders and ward executives in ward 8 Ado-Ekiti local Government Area of Ekiti State recently defied the APC State Working Committee to initiate the suspension process on the Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Political Matters, Senator Babafemi Ojudu Ojudu over alleged anti-party activities. The presidential aide and Governor Kayode Fayemi have for some time been engaged in war of words. Ojudu accused Fayemi of non-performance running a one-man government but the Governor described the presidential aide as being driven by selfish ambitions.
