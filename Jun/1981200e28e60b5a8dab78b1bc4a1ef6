 The Court of Appeal in Abuja has upheld the suspension of Adams Oshiomhole as the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC). In a judgment delivered on Tuesday evening, a three-man panel of the court dismissed Oshiomhole’s appeal against an earlier judgment of a High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).  The appellate court held that Oshiomhole’s appeal was without merit. The FCT High Court had, in its judgment in March, held among others that Oshiomhole could no longer function as the APC National Chairman having been suspended by his local branch, a suspension he failed to challenged before the party’s National Working Committee (NEC) suspended him. ‎
