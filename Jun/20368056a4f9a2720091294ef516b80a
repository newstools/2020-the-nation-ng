 THE World Health Organisation (WHO) has stopped its Solidarity Trial arm that researches into the use of Hydroxychloroquine to treat patients infected with COVID-19. It said several studies have indicated that Hydroxychloroquine (an anti-malaria drug) had no impact whatsoever on the virus, and does not result in the reduction of mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This is coming days after the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) revoked the emergency authorisation for Hydroxychloroquine to treat hospitalised COVID-19 patients, amidst several pieces of evidence that it could cause serious side-effects and that it does not work. WHO, in a statement on Thursday, said: “The Solidarity Trial’s Hydroxychloroquine arm is being stopped, on the basis of evidence showing it does not reduce mortality for hospitalised COVID-19 patients.”
