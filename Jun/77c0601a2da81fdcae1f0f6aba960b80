Odion Ighalo has declared his intention to do what he can to take Manchester United “higher and higher” following the extension of his loan deal at Old Trafford. The Nigerian forward signed for the Red Devils on an initial six-month loan deal back in January and he was due to return to his parent club Shanghai Shenhua this summer. Ighalo has made a decent start to life at Old Trafford, scoring four goals and making one assist in all competitions for the Red Devils so far. Speaking in an interview quoted by Sky Sports, Ighalo said: “I’m really happy. It’s a dream for me to be here. I’m buzzing and ready to go. “Since the first day I arrived, I made it clear that I wanted whatever it takes to continue that work. “Like I’ve said, since I was young, I’ve been supporting this club and playing for it is a dream. Now I’ve extended my loan, it makes it more even clear and I’m committed as I know, in my head, I’m here until January ending. “I just want to work hard and enjoy it, support the team and do whatever I can to make us go higher and higher.” Manchester United are currently in fifth place in the Premier League table and three points behind fourth-placed Chelsea FC as the race for Champions League qualification via a top-four finish hots up.
