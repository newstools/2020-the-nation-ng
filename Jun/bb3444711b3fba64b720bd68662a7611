Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Sujimoto Construction Limited, Mr. Sijibomi Ogundele has said that investing in real estate during the COVID-19 pandemic is not a waste. He said there is a blessing in every adversity, as he added that the COVID-19 has indeed been a blessing in disguise for him. He said, “I have come up with more ideas than ever and even had time to study my past and also re-assess the opportunities in real estate. “Many have said that the real estate industry is one of the worst hit by the COVID-19 Pandemic, but we have been here before during the last recession and we didn’t sink! Just like other times, we shall learn from it, rise and re-strategise.” Expatiating, he said he is focusing on three fundamental including People, Prudence, and Projects. “We have three major projects we have in the pipeline that will bring a minimum of 200 percent ROI to Sujimoto. Most projects will last a minimum of one year, so while other organisations are in limbo, folding their hands and waiting for the pandemic to be over before they take any meaningful action, we have already started. By the time the world is ready to restart, we will be done.” He said his company has developed a highly viable and profitable strategy and found an opportunity for savvy investors to invest N5 billion into Sujimoto and get N10 billion back in three years. On the effect of claims that there are more than 2,000 empty apartments in Banana Island, Ikoyi and Victoria, Ogundele said for them at Sujimoto, they do not know what ‘empty apartment’ means because, in the heat of the 2016/17 recession, we sold out projects in Ikoyi.”
