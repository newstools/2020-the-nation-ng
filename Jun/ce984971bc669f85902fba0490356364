 THE street is the new red carpet! Get the look! Wardrobe favourites aren’t going anywhere. Whether you’re shopping for the classic or something to make a statement, now is the time to make a move! The classic blazer – Interestingly, timeless fashion pieces retain their popularity, because apart from transcending the trends, they go with almost everything in your wardrobe. A well-tailored and finely-fitted jacket will help to show off feminine curves and can be paired with everything in your collection, from work trousers to denims. Turtleneck sweatshirt – Neckline trends come and go like weather, but a turtleneck sweatshirt has earned its place as a classic, come rain or sunshine! Pearls – Feminine pearls and beads are the perfect trend-proof accessories to compliment your look. Wear gray pearls with black for a sexy tonal look; or choose layers of creamy pearls, worn with a simple black sheath dress for that perfect cocktail outfit. Cross shoulder handbag-The smaller the bag, the better; and they all work under everything from cardigans to jackets or gowns. Sneakers and stilettos – These are a great choice when it comes to looking stately. A chic and gorgeous bum short, with or without details, keeps heads turning and eyes glued to the lady. Touch of Ankara – A little leg and a touch of pattern is a one-way ticket to that very cool appearance. Chic sling or bum shoulder bag is what celebs are rocking right now! Denim – As we all know, denims are a key part of most people’s wardrobe, male and female alike. What trends should you go for this season? There are varieties to choose from, ranging from skinny to coloured denim, high waist to ripped and boyfriend denim. Celebrities and fashionistas just can’t stop wearing these dazzling styles everywhere. Big rock-cocktail rings give you an instant boost of style. It is one fashion accessory that will never go out of style and can last a lifetime with the proper care.
