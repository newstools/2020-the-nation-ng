 ARSENAL manager Mikel Arteta secured his first Premier League away win as Eddie Nketiah and Joe Willock found the target in a much-needed 2-0 victory at Southampton. The deadlock was broken after 20 minutes, with Saints goalkeeper Alex McCarthy’s clearance was blocked by the young striker, who tapped home into the empty net to score his fourth goal for the Gunners. Jack Stephens saw red for the second time in his career in the closing stages as he brought down Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang as the Gabon international bore down on goal. The contest was then settled three minutes from time as Joe Willock responded quickest to any Saints defender to fire home from close range after substitute Alexandre Lacazette’s shot was beaten away by McCarthy. Meanwhile, Jay Rodriguez scored the only goal of the game as Burnley edged past relegation threatened Watford 1-0 at Turf Moor.
