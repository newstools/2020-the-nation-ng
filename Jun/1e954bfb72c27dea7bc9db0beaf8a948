 A Spanish porn star has been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter after a photographer died while inhaling psychedelic toad venom during a mystic ritual. Nacho Vidal was detained in connection with the death of Jose Luis Abad who had used a pipe to breath in the hallucinogenic substance at Mr Vidal’s home near Valencia last July. In a statement on Thursday, police said they arrested the 46-year-old – star of such films as Nacho Invades America and Brazilian Butt Fest – following an 11-month investigation into the fatal incident. It said: “The police operation began following the victim’s death during the celebration of a mystic ritual based on the inhalation of venom of the bufo alvarius toad.” Two other men have also been arrested with all three now released on bail. A lawyer for Mr Vidal, Daniel Salvador, said his client “considers himself to be innocent”, describing the death as an unfortunate accident. He said the photographer had “previously tried that substance and wanted to try it again” in a “comfortable” environment. With all due respect to the dead man and his family, Nacho maintains that the consumption was completely voluntary,” he told La Vanguardianewspaper. The ritual of inhaling the venom has previously been promoted by Mr Vidal – whose achievements include being introduced into the Adult Video News Hall of Fame – in YouTube video. (www.newsnow.co.uk)
