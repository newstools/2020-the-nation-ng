 The Fourteenth Moon Foundation (FMF) has distributed Eid-il-Fitri packages to about 50 families in Lagos. The distribution saw representatives of the families went home with a chicken and rice each. FMF Founder Qasim Badrudeen said the distribution was done in a bid to assist the beneficiaries during this trying period. He said the coronavirus lockdown made things difficult for many families, including feeding. According to him, the packages distributed were donated by well-meaning Nigerians. He said: “With the lockdown in Lagos and other places, many Muslims’ incomes were affected. And they would need to celebrate Eid as commanded by Allah. This year, we were able to reach about 50 families and we hope to reach more families in subsequent editions. “It is our joy that we were able to put smiles on the faces of people. We appreciate the donors and pray to Allah to continue to enrich their pockets.” Badrudeen noted that the foundation is also planning to distribute meats during the Eid-il-Adha (Ileya) celebration. “This will In Sha Allah not affect our annual ‘Eat the Ram” programme during sallah. We appeal for support and hope to also put smiles on the faces of people during the festival,” he added. The beneficiaries, however, appreciated the gesture, praying for both the organisation and donors.
