The recent outburst of Nigeria’s Ambassador to Togo, Olusola Iji, on the mode of primary election to be adopted by his party in Ondo State is a confirmation that the last may not have been heard of this contentious matter that has pitched many of the governorship aspirants against Governor Rotimi Akeredolu. Iji, who is also one of the governorship aspirants, had threatened to sue the All Progressives Congress (APC) if it uses the indirect primary mode to elect its governorship candidate in Ondo State, without adhering to the party’s constitution. He alleged that the indirect primary mode was used in the past without election of delegates, as stipulated in the APC constitution. The aspirant’s latest position has, according to insiders, exposed the depth of disagreement within the party in the state as they prepare for the governorship primaries. This is mainly because, until now, many had believed the rumour that Iji had agreed to step down for Akeredolu. Denying the allegation, Iji said “I will not step down for Akeredolu. For him to express interest that he wants to contest, having secured the party’s ticket twice and he wants to get it again, means it is inequitable.”
