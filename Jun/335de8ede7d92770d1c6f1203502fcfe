The founder of the Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN), Prophet T.B. Joshua, said Wednesday that he was waiting for God’s direction on when to open his church. Joshua spoke in response to the Federal Government’s guidelines for reopening religious centres. Federal and State governments shut most worship centres in most of the country in the wake of the novel coronavirus pandemic. The Presidential Task Force on the pandemic said Tuesday that places of worship had been identified as a major avenue of potential COVID-19 SPREAD. PTF National Coordinator, Dr. Aliyu Sani, who announced the guidelines, added: “It is better to stay at home and worship than to go into a place of worship.” Responding to the government’s advice, Joshua said in a statement that he would reopen SCOAN when God asks him to do so. He said: “Don’t forget there was a revelation three times concerning the church closing. “That same God, we are waiting to hear from on when to reopen – when things will go back to normal – as usual. God’s time is the best. We are waiting at His feet for that time. We are tarrying for the Holy Spirit’s instruction. Pray without ceasing. “Meet us as usual on Emmanuel TV until we hear from God when to reopen, the same God who gave us the prophecy three times about the church closing. It is God’s work, not our work. Here, our thanks go to the authorities for understanding. Jesus is Lord!”
