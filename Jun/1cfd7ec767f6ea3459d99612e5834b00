Early morning fire has razed a bar and a brothel in Port Harcourt, Rivers State. It was gathered that the inferno, which occurred at the weekend destroyed the properties located at Azikiwe Street, Mile 2 Diobu area of Port Harcourt. The cooking activities of a food vendor stationed within the premises reportedly ignited the fire that caused the havoc. A source said that 20 rooms in the brothel and valuables worth millions of naira were destroyed by the fire. He said the fire raged following failed attempts by sympathisers to reach the state fire service for help. He said: “The fire started at a small food vendor’s place, where a woman sells food in front of the brothel at about 8am. The oil she was using caught fire and exploded, while people were trying to extinguish it, the fire spread to the building. “Youths in the area tried to put out the fire to no avail. Many calls to the state fire service were not answered for over three hours, until the fire consumed everything.” Another eyewitness, who spoke in confidence, said the youths tried to put out the fire with buckets of fire but got tired when their efforts yielded no positive results. i He said: “We struggled with the fire for more than three hours to put it out but were unable. We used buckets of water, sachet water and every other method we know but could not put it out, at point we all became tired. “If not for the initial efforts of the boys, the fire would have spread to other buildings, but fortunately the losses were minimal, although the situation is saddening.” The Director of the affected brothel, Prince Ihunwo, appealed to well-meaning persons to assist him, saying the business was his only source of income.
