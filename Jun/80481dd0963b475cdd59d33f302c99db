Police in Lagos have arrested a barber for brutalising his four-year-old son, leaving him with several bodily scars. Tunde Alabi was accused of beating his son, Ezekiel to a coma on Sunday. The four-year-old boy was said to have excreted on his body and Alabi beat him severely, inflicting multiple wounds on him. The Igando Divisional Police Officer, Taiwo Kasumu, a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP) confirmed Alabi’s arrest. He said: “We have arrested him and the child is with us. Though the child can’t be with us; I have contacted the Lagos State Child Protection Unit for further action.” Residents of 5 Afam Ani Street, Igando where the man lives, said the boy was always being maltreated by his father and stepmother. One of them said Ezekiel was recently brought back from his mother, who also reportedly suffered domestic violence before leaving Alabi’s home. “Tunde married another wife and the woman always beat Ezekiel at every little provocation; nobody in the neighbourhood could stop Tunde from beating the boy because of his unruly behaviour.
