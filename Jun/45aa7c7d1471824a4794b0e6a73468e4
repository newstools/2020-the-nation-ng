Super Eagles striker Samuel Chukwuemze may be listed in the starting line-up of Villarreal when the Yellow Submarine visit Celta Vigo at the resumption of the 2019/2020 La Liga season. Chukwueze who was on the bench against Leganes in their last match would probably be thrown into the middle by Coach Javi Calleja, as they are aiming to end their consecutive defeats. The Nigerian star has been attracted to several European clubs but Chukwueze knew what is at stake when they travel to face the Sky Blues side who are currently just above the relegation zone in 17th spot but will enter the tie in better form than a Villarreal side that occupy eighth position in the table. Chukwueze’s Villarreal side have won 11 of their 27 league games – the same number as Atletico – but they have also lost 11 times, including their last three against Atletico, Athletic Bilbao and Leganes. Villarreal currently sit eighth in the table, four points behind seventh-placed Valencia and seven behind sixth-placed Atletico Madrid heading into tomorrow’s contest away to Celta Vigo. Celta Vigo will be looking to extend their unbeaten run in La Liga to six matches when they host Villarreal. The Oscar Garcia side were in solid form before the lockdown period, though, embarking on a five-game unbeaten run which included victories over Sevilla and Leganes.
