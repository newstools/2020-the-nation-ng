Shortly after the swearing in of Hon. Isaac Auta, as the new Deputy Speaker of Kaduna Assembly, a member representing Makera Constituency, Hon. Liman Dahiru broke into the floor of the Assembly and seized the maze. However before he could make his way out of the chamber, he was grabbed by the Sergeant at Arm while other members quickly rushed in to retrieve the maze from him. The plenary thereafter ended in a rowdy session while the aggrieved member, Dahiru Liman was dragged out of the chamber. Liman, who had his dress torn, was later seen outside the Assembly Chamber displaying anger over the the impeachment of Hazo.
