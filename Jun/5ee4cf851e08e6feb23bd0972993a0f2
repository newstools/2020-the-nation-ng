Pedro has refused to play for Chelsea for the remainder of the campaign as he doesn’t want to jeopardise a transfer to Roma, according to reports. The Spaniard revealed back in March that he would be leaving Stamford Bridge in the summer when his contract with the club expires. The former Barcelona star has only appeared 17 times in all competitions for Chelsea this campaign, 12 of those starts, contributing two goals and an assist. And The Athletic claims that Pedro is ‘unwilling to finish the season with Chelsea’ as he doesn’t want to put his move to Roma “at risk”. The 32-year-old has agreed a deal with the Serie A side on a contract worth £56,ooo a week that will see him remain in Rome until 2022, with the option of another year.
