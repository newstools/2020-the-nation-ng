In Yorubaland, they say you don’t count wives for a king. Having that in mind, let’s just conclude that Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi, is blessed with many women. For a king who has many wives, it’s only normal for him to have a favourite at different times depending on circumstances. If a mother has a favourite child, why can’t a king? The gist in town is that Queen Anuoluwapo Adeyemi presently occupies a special position in Alaafin’s heart. According to insiders, even when other queens are not with the 81-year-old paramount ruler of Oyo kingdom, there are hardly occasions you wouldn’t see Anu. Few days ago, the alleged Alaafin’s favourite reminded everyone why the king didn’t waste time to take her as a wife. Celebrating her birthday with charming pictures on social media, the mother of a set of twins thanked God for the gift of life and praised Him for being a strong bone in her life.
