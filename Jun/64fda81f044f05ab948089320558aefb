Crisis has hit the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Owo, Owo Local Government Area of Ondo State, as two persons are laying claim to be chairman of the party in the council. They are Sydney Ogunleye and Chief Taiwo Olatunde. Owo is the hometown of Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, Jumoke Ajasin-Anifowose and other governorship aspirants. Ogunleye is loyal to Governor Akeredolu, while Olatunde is loyal to other aspirants, including a former Deputy Clerk of the National Assembly, Chief Olayide Adelami, who is aspiring to remove Akeredolu from office. Ogunleye, who insisted that he is the chairman of APC in Owo, said Adelami is not a member of the APC. He said that there was no time Adelami registered or participated as a member of the APC in Ondo State. Ogunleye, who spoke at a meeting of the party with political appointees in Owo, said political careers are not started with governorship ambition without recourse to the party or getting registered as a member. He accused Adelami of sponsoring thugs to foment trouble in the state. Ogunleye said the party would provide a level playing field for aspirants, who are registered members of the party seeking the ticket at the primary election. He said the people are agitating for the return of Governor Akeredolu and the APC because of his achievements. Adelami, who spoke through his Campaign Coordinator, Kehinde Bello, said Olatunde is the chairman of the party in Owo. He accused Ogunleye of impersonating APC leadership in Owo. Adelami described Ogunleye as a mischief maker.
