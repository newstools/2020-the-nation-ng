In Odidi community, women were said to have been dressed in black clothing to protest under the heavy downpour on Saturday. Public relations officers of Odidi and Kantu communities, Messrs Godwin Akorie and Beke Timinimi, told newsmen they informed military men guarding the platform of the intention of the communities to shut down the flow station over alleged failure of the operator to keep its promises to the area. “We met with the military men to  inform them of our intention to put off the flare. We came to make them understand our plights. This issue has gone to the state governor to no avail. “All the agreements reached with the company, promises made by the company nothing has been met,” Godwin said. Diebiri Batan community PRO, Peter Dio, decried the alleged failure of Neconde to clear its debt to the community, adding that the Batan flow station would remain shut until the debts were cleared. But responding to allegations raised by the communities, Neconde had in a newspaper advertorial said it had continued to carry the communities along in its operations. It stated it recognised its host communities as “critical stakeholders in the JV and we have implemented a deliberate and consistent policy of economic empowerment for community entrepreneurs that has led to the award of several contracts to members of our community. “Community related contracts for various services within the asset currently stand at N604 million monthly and N7.3 billion annually”.
