 Waka superstar, Salawa Abeni has met with her blackmailer saying she’s not his first victim. Abeni made this known after the operatives of Rapid Response Squad, RRS, arrested 19-year-old Emmanuel Oladunjoye Olufowoke, who confessed to threatening to share nude pictures of the singer on the internet in exchange for money. Speaking on the blackmailer, Abeni said “I just want to use this opportunity to thank Nigerians all over the world, the Nigerian Police Force RRS for helping to catch this boy as I am not his first victim. I am extremely grateful for all the love, concern and support shown despite everything that is going in our daily lives. Modupe o! God bless you all.” The suspected blackmailer also said he engaged in the act to get some few bucks off Salawa Abeni after coming in contact with the private pictures.  He added that after downloading the nude photographs of Salawa Abeni on his phone, he picked up her mobile number from her Instagram page. “On 1st of April, 2020, I chatted her up and also called her after sending a few of the photos to her online. My intention was to negotiate with her for a few bucks and for me to destroy the photographs. I thought everything was going on fine until the following day when I heard the news of the blackmail over the radio. I was with my mother. She was even cursing the blackmailer unknown to her that I was the brain behind it. I immediately sneaked out, destroyed the memory card, and threw my mobile phone and SIM card into a nearby wetland in Magboro. Since then, I never mentioned it to anyone and called Madam Salawa Abeni about it again”, he said.
