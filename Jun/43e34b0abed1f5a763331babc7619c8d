The crucial role of the private sector in maintaining sports infrastructure across the country cannot be underestimated. These were the submission Minister of Youth and Sports Development Sunday Dare, who admitted that the sports edifices across the country cannot be maintained solely by government as the involvement of the private sector would complement government at ensuring that the structures are in good shape. The minister was speaking against the backdrop of efforts made by the ministry since his assumption of office to ensure that sports structures across the country are in good shape to host major events. “These sports facilities have been abandoned for years, so no magic can fix it in eight months. However, since we came into office, we have initiated multiple processes both public and private to get the stadiums fixed. Kaduna State Governor Malam Nasir El Rufai has committed himself to fixing the Ahmadu Bello Stadium in Kaduna. The National Stadium in Lagos is to be concession. Even the Awolowo Stadium in Ibadan will soon be on the path to concession. So we want to restore their lost glory to the benefit of our athletes and all Nigerians. The long years of neglect cannot be corrected overnight.” Dare said. To this end, he added: “The ministry is muzzling both government and private resources in this direction.” The minister who spoke during the inauguration of a committee to audit the National Stadium in Lagos said efforts would be made to ensure that sanity is restored to stadiums across the country. Since assuming office, the minister has brought sanity to the Moshood Abiola Stadium in Abuja which has also hosted several meetings, events and top dignitaries including the President of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Thomas Bach.
