Nigerian equities recorded their first gain in recent days on Wednesday after bargain-hunting transactions in large-cap stocks overshadowed underlying sell pressure to lift equities’ capitalisation by N22 billion. With more than two decliners to every advancer, most deals were still closing at discounts but gains recorded by large-cap stocks in the food manufacturing sector coloured the overall market position. Benchmark indices yesterday at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) indicated average gain of 0.17 per cent, moderating the negative average year-to-date return to -7.0 per cent. The All Share Index (ASI)- the common value-based index that tracks all share prices at the Exchange, rose from its opening index of 24,930.88 points to close at 24,972.89 points. Aggregate market value of all quoted equities also improved from N13.005 trillion to close at N13.027 trillion. With 24 decliners to 10 advancers, most sectoral indices closed negative, underlining the widespread profit-taking transactions that had characterised transactions in recent days. The NSE Consumer Goods Index was the only gainers with a gain of 4.2 per cent. The NSE Oil & Gas Index dropped by 4.4 per cent. The NSE Insurance Index declined by 3.0 per cent. The NSE Banking Index dipped by 0.8 per cent while the NSE Industrial Goods Index closed flat. Nestle Nigeria, NSE’s highest-priced stock, led the gainers with a gain of N99.50 to close at N1,094.50. Flour Mills of Nigeria, Nigeria’s largest flour miller, followed with a gain of 85 kobo to close at N20.40. Cadbury Nigeria rose by 50 kobo to close at N8 while Access Bank rallied 10 kobo to close at N6.85 per share. On the negative side, Seplat Petroleum Development Company led the losers with a drop off N47.60 to close at N428.80. Guaranty Trust Bank followed with a loss of 60 kobo to close at N23. Dangote Sugar Refinery dropped by 30 kobo to close at N14.50. Fidson Healthcare lost 23 kobo to close at N3.40 while Neimeth International Pharmaceuticals and Red Star Express declined by 20 kobo each to close at N1.89 and N3.60 respectively.
