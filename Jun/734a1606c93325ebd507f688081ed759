 ONDO State Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu on Monday declared that the spread of COVID-19 has reached a state of emergency. Akeredolu’s statement came after 80 new cases and nine deaths were recorded within one-week. Infected cases in 13 local government areas have risen to 154 with Akure South local government taking the lead with 68 cases. Checks showed that the confirmed positive cases were from 1,052 and 1,257 samples collected. Active cases on admission are 71 with 47 persons discharged and 18 deaths recorded. The 13 councils where cases have been reported are Akure South (68), Odigbo (nine), Owo (six), Ose (three), Akure North (seven), Ondo West (14), Okitipupa (35), Akoko South West (5), Akoko South East (one), Ile-Oluji/Okeigbo (one), Ifedore (three), Ilaje (one) and Ese Odo (one). Akeredolu, who spoke at a news conference, said 727 contacts of confirmed cases have been line-listed, 287 persons were under follow-up and 440 persons have completed 14-days follow-up exercise. The governor noted that the reality of COVID-19 was the dangerous spread within communities and within the state from persons to persons. “Government is seriously concerned about this disturbing record and trend, more so that no end appears yet in sight. In fact, what seems to be in view is the undesirable increase in our vulnerability as a result of our deliberate nonchalant attitude. “The only solution, as I often say, is to take the very simple but necessary action of self-protection by obeying and practising the basic national prevention and control protocols. The point must be made again that what this spike is also showing us is the embarrassing fact that many people still do not believe that the virus exists, talk more of making a conscious effort at prevention,” he said.
