The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) on Friday said the demise of Senator Abiola Ajimobi, the former deputy National Chairman, South has cost the party a decent man whose spirit and character embodied the party’s progressive mantra. The party, in a statement by its National Chairman, Caretaker Committee, Governor Mai Mala Buni, said it was deeply saddened by the death of Ajimobi, the immediate-past governor of Oyo State. “Senator Ajimobi’s death has come at a crucial time when the party is looking up to our well-meaning leaders to champion the needed reforms and reconciliation moves to be undertaken by the newly-appointed caretaker committee of our great party. “The APC has lost a decent man who in spirit and character embodied our progressive mantra. “In mourning, we remember the fond memories and indelible strides Senator Ajimobi left behind. We will always remember a loving father, husband, gentleman, astute administrator, patriotic Nigerian, fine politician who was exemplary in all his private and public endeavors”. The party condoled the immediate family, the government and people of Oyo State as well as the entire APC family over the painful loss of the former governor of Oyo State. It also prayed Almighty Allah to be merciful and grant Senator Ajimobi Aljanat Firdaus.
