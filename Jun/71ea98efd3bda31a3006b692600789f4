 OPERATIVES of the Inspector General of Police (IG) Monitoring Unit in Lagos on Thursday arrested popular nightclub owner Pascal Okechukwu alias Cubana Chief Priest. Okechukwu was detained at the unit headed by Ngozi Braide, a Chief Superintendent of Police, over allegations of money laundering and misuse of security detail attached to him. In March the police IG was tipped off about Okechukwu’s alleged misuse of policemen attached to him. He was alleged to have turned them to domestic helps and messengers, a development that forced the IG to order his investigation especially with regards to his sources of income. Police sources told The Nation that his reckless display of wealth exposed him to investigation, adding that he posted a picture on his Instagram page where he displayed piles of foreign currencies. “As I speak with you, he is in our cell. They use the police recklessly on social media and display bunches of foreign currencies. We are clamping down on them,” said a senior officer yesterday.
