 A renowned Ifa Priest and the Olu of Ibogun, Owu Kingdom, in the Ifo Local Government Area of Ogun State, Oba ( Dr.) Fakayode Adesina Faluade, has said that since his discovery of the herbal researches for the cure of coronavirus  pandemic currently ravaging the global community, he had successfully cured three victims of the disease. Oba Faluade, who made this known in a chat with newsmen over the weekend at his Ibogun Palace, stated that on the application of the herbs on the victims, they were successfully let off the hook with results of their tests coming out negative. The monarch, therefore, reiterated his earlier appeals to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), the Federal Ministry of Health,  the National Institute for Pharmaceutical Research and Development, Federal Ministry of Science and Technology, the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control ( NAFDAC) and the various state governments to send any two victims of coronavirus in their custody to him for cure with no intention of any monetary compensation from the government agencies. Oba Faluade, who is the promoter of the Ifa Olokun Foundation, assured both the Nigerian people and the global community of the efficacy of his researched local herbs not only for the cure of the pandemic, but also for its prevention. While urging Nigerians to continue adhering to the global precautionary measures laid down to end the scourge, he commended the governments at both the state and federal levels for the various measures being put in place to contain the spread of the virus since its outbreak. Speaking on the Ifa divination for the cure of the diseases, the Ifa priest explained that the gods were angry with the people and required necessary appeasements, adding that Ifa, however, predicted the end of the pandemic as soon as necessary appeasements were made. The Ibogun monarch, who once again prayed for an end to the pandemic and other imminent calamities that await the country and the global community, promised that he would continue to do his utmost best in getting necessary solutions to various diseases ravaging the society.
