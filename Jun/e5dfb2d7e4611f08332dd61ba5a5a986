 Lagos Chief Imam, Sheikh Sulaimon Oluwatoyin Abou-Nolla, has described Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s suspension of religious activities in the state as a welcome development. The action, Sheikh Abou-Nolla said, showed that the governor was passionate about saving the lives of Lagosians. He urged Muslims to abide by the governor’s directive. “The decision is in line with our thoughts of not endangering the lives of our people. It is those who are alive that can worship Allah. We thank Governor Sanwo-Olu and his cabinet members for showing concern for the lives of the people. “I urged our Muslim brothers and sisters to comply with the directive. All Mosques should remain close till COVID-19 pandemic is defeated,” he said.  He reiterated that there was no basis for the reopening of the religious centres going by the increasing figures of the COVID-19 cases. Grand Mufti of Conference of Islamic Organisations (CIO) Sheikh Dhikrullah Shafi’I also described the governor’s decision as a right step. Lagosians, he said, should not view the suspension negatively. Sheikh Shafi’I said: “It is a proactive decision taken to safeguard lives of Lagosians in particular and Nigerians in general as Lagos is the epicentre of the virus in the country. “When the decision is strictly viewed from Islamic jurisprudence, the decision is sound and consistent with the position of Islam. Although, religion occupies a foremost position in Islamic law, but in the face of an existential threat to the life of humans, the preservation of life becomes the first priority. “In view of the foregoing, I want to call for calm and understanding among religious leaders and adherents to abide by the decision of the Lagos State government. This is also the position of the Muslim Community of Lagos after weighing the implications of the early re-opening of religious places when COVID-19 is still wrecking havoc in the state. May Allah provide humanity with the antidote for this virus.”
