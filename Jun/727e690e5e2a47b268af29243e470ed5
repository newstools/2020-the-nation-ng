His assailants killed him with machetes, it was learnt. Efforts of the mother who heard his shout for help could not save him as he was confirmed dead on arrival at the nearby hospital he was taken to by neighbours. The distrust mother said, “He told his elder one that he wanted to go and defecate. The elder one opened the backdoor for him to go defecate. “Had I known I would have asked him to defecate in the front of the house. Suddenly, he cried out ‘Mummy, Mummy. “His elder one and I rushed out to the backyard but didn’t see him initially. Then I went to check inside the bush and found him cut with machete. He hadn’t died when we got there. People took him from my hand to take him to the hospital.” Police spokesman Olugbenga Fadeyi confirmed the incident, adding that his men were on the matter.
