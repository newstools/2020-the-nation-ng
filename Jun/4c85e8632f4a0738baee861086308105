If you don’t know Abisola Kola-Daisi, you will definitely remember her father, Abiola Ajimobi, former Oyo state governor. Raised in America, Abisola is a definition of class and luxury. Anywhere she steps in, she turns heads. Apart from being the daughter of a top Yoruba politician, her beauty is alluring. A part many don’t know about the Chief Executive Officer of FH Luxury is her craze for bags. When she recently showed off her collection on social media, it appeared too much for one person. But that is the stuff Abisola is made of. She is an unrepentant lover of bags and her taste for fashion is out of this world. Despite being a mother of three – two boys and a girl, you can’t tell by merely taking a glance at her physique. She looks stunning every time and cuts a picture of a woman without worries. Abisola has been married to Kolapo Kola-Daisi, son of a billionaire industrialist from Ibadan since 2010.
