 A 32-YEAR-OLD driver, Mayowa Adeyemo has been remanded in Ilesha Correctional Centre for allegedly battering his 18-month-old son with burning cigarettes. Adeyemo was arraigned before an Osun State Magistrates’ Court Osogbo on Tuesday on two counts bothering on assault and exploitation. Police prosecutor Abiodun Fagboyinbo told the court that the defendant beat the child with a stick and burned him with a cigarette. Adeyemo, who did not have legal representation, said, “I have five children from five different mothers. Several pastors I consulted told me that my mother was the one bewitching me. I am a taxi driver but things have not been fine for me. The son I assaulted with sticks is the son that my fourth wife bore for me.” Chief Magistrate Modupe Awodele remanded Adeyemo in Ilesha Correctional Centre and adjourned the case to July 14.
