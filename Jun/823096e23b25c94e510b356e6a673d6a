 Kwara State House of Assembly has asked the state government to probe former Governor AbdulFafah Ahmed and the Director-General, KP3, Yomi Ogunsola, over their alleged handling of the Light Up Kwara project. The house urged the executive to hand them over to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for further investigation. It directed the state government to hand over Investment One that handled the Infrastructure Fund Kwara (IFK), Reccofortezza-A Steven and Rubitec, contractors that handled the Light-Up Kwara Project over the same reason. These were part of the resolutions of the assembly plenary on the report of an ad-hoc committee on the investigation into the Light-Kwara project executed by the last administration.  Reading the resolutions of the house, Speaker Yakubu Danladi Salihu said the state government should review the terms and conditions of contract for the project and direct the contractors to complete outstanding work on the project. He urged the government to transfer the activities of Light-Up Kwara project to the supervision and monitoring of the Ministry of Energy in the interest of accountability and transparency. The legislature resolved that the state government should repeal the Kwara State Bureau of Public, Private Partnership (KP3) Law to allow ministries take charge of statutory responsibilities handled by KP3. The Speaker said that the state government should order the then Director-General of KP3 to return to Nigeria to shed light on the grey areas of the project. The legislature had on October 3, 2019 at plenary set up the ad-hoc committee to probe the activities of the Light-Up Kwara project of the past administration.
