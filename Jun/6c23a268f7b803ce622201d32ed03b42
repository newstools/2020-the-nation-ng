MANCHESTER CITY set to be first team to give Liverpool ‘guard of honour’ after their emphatic Premier League title win… with Jurgen Klopp’s side expected to receive SEVEN coronations from opposition in remaining matches Liverpool won their first ever Premier League title on Thursday with seven matches of the season left after Chelsea beat Manchester City. City’s defeat confirmed the inevitable as the Reds won their first topflight title in 30 years with one of the most dominant seasons in English football. They are currently 23 points ahead of second-placed City, who won the title in the last two previous seasons. As luck would have it, Liverpool’s next Premier League match is against the club they de-throned, Manchester City, next Thursday.  Pep Guardiola’s side are expected to give the new Premier League champions a guard of honour at the Etihad Stadium. The gesture is not compulsory but is often tradition once a team wins the Premier League before the final day. City will not be the only team to give Liverpool the guard of honour, however, as seven teams are expected to do so before they play the champions. Aston Villa, Brighton, Burnley, Arsenal, Chelsea and Newcastle are all set to congratulate Liverpool before their matches as the season enters the final game weeks. However, the Premier League still need to approve the guard of honour due to new protocols enforced by the coronavirus pandemic.
