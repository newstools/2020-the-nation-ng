 The Federal Government has assured N-Power monitors that their two months payment will be paid within the next 72 hours. The monitors are currently being owed three months stipend. This was disclosed by the Honourable Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Farouq. The Minister while assuring that the payment process for March and April stipend was almost completed, noted that the process for May payment was also on-going. According to her, all approvals have been made and processes for payment triggered. This is contained in a statement in Abuja on Tuesday by the Deputy Director of Information, Rhoda Iliya. The Minister said: “The delay for the payment was due to the change in Government Policy of migration from the REMITA platform system to the GIFMIS system of payment which requires offloading the beneficiaries into the new system before finally uploading, reviewing and final payment by the Social Investment Programme (SIP). “I regret any inconveniences caused by this delay towards the payment of the monitors of N-Power, who have proven their mantle as patriotic Nigerians. “I assure all beneficiaries that GIFMIS is already uploading beneficiaries into the system and hopefully within the next 72 hours, all beneficiaries will start to receive their alerts.”
