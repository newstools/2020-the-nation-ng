The House of Representatives has been shut down by the management of the National Assembly for routine fumigation exercise. The House is to remain shut for the two-day exercise while workers are expected to stay away from the House for two days â€“ Thursday and Friday. The staff are expected to resume normal duties on Monday, June 22, but it was not immediately known whether scheduled House committee functions will go ahead or not. It could also not be ascertained whether the exercise has anything to do with Covid-19 pandemic. Also on Wednesday, the Edo State House of Assembly was shut for 14 days for fumigation. Acting Director, Administration and Supplies, Stephen Guobadia, on behalf of the Clerk of the House, directed staff members to remain at home.
