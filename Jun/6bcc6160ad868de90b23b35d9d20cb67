An Ondo state High Court sitting in Akure has fined the Deji of Akure Kingdom, Oba Aladetoyinbo Ogunlade Aladelusi, the sum of #7,500 for demanding for what the court termed as frivolous adjournments. The court imposed the fine at the resumed hearing of a suit seeking the courtâ€™s order to stop the Akure Monarch from interfering in the chieftaincy affairs of Akure North Local Government Area including the appointment, installation or approval of the appointment of any minor Chief in Akure North Local Government Area of Ondo State. Justice O. Akintan-Osadebay ordered the Monarch to pay the fine after his lawyer; Mr Olusola Oke informed the court that the Deji of Akure was indisposed to be in court to open his defence. Oke applied for adjournment of the suit to enable the Deji prepare for his defence but lawyer to the Claimants, Mr Femi Emmanuel-Emodamori opposed him. Emodamori reminded the court of unnecessary delay tactics by Akure Monarch in the suit since the commencement of the case eight years ago. He requested for cost to be awarded against the monarch in favour of the claimants. Emodamori noted that the case had been adjourned several times after the claimants as well as 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants closed their case, while the 4th defendant had refused to open and closed his defence. Oke agreed to pay N5000 but Justice Akintan-Osadebay awarded a cost of #7,500 against Oba Aladetoyinbo in favour of the claimants. The judge warned that the case would be closed for adoption of written addresses if the Deji failed again to open and close his defence on the adjourned date. The case was adjourned to July 21st, 2020.
