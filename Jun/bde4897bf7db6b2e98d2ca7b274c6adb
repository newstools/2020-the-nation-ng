Community policing has taken off in Lagos with the police command on Thursday inaugurating three Community Policing Committees (CPCs) across the area commands, local council areas and divisions in the state. These committees were inaugurated by the Assistant Inspector General of Police (AIG) Zone two, Ahmed Iliyasu accompanied by Police Commissioner Hakeem Odumosu and Deputy Commissioners of Police (DCPs). According to a statement by spokesman Bala Elkana, the committees inaugurated were Area Command Community Policing Advisory committees, Local Government Advisory committees and Divisional Community Policing Committees. These inaugurations followed the earlier establishment of State Community Policing Advisory Committee and State Community Policing Committee by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to drive community policing policies and strategies approved by the federal government and championed by the police. Elkana said, “Community policing is both a philosophy and an organisational strategy that allows the police and the community to work closely together in creative ways to solve the problems of crime, illicit drugs, fear of crime and social disorder. It is a partnership between the police and members of the community to fight crime, criminalities and other social issues/disorder within the community which will eventually improve the quality of life for everyone in that community. “The community policing model being envisioned for Nigeria is one that draws on the legal opportunities provided by the Police Act for the engagement of Special Constables who will serve as Community Policing Officers under the coordination of the Nigeria Police towards evolving a community-focused policing architecture. “This is necessitated by the fact that crime is community-based and community-based approach is required to effectively address it. In other words, local problems should be given local solutions.”
