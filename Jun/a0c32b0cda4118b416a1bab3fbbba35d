Edo Governor Godwin Obaseki on Saturday said that he still enjoys the support and sympathy of Governors elected on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).

Answering a question, the Governor said his support base cuts across party lines. According to him, even dignitaries and other well- meaning Nigerians have come to identify with his aspiration, adding “they are all united against injustice”. Details shortly..
