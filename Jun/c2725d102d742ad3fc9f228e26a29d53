A middle-aged man has been arrested for allegedly battering his house help, one Chioma Ogbu in 3-3 area of Onitsha, Anambra State. The suspect, Hillary Apeh from Enugu state was said to have severally assaulted the victim with marks all over her body for not fetching water for him to bath with. A resident of the area, who simply identified himself as Statesman, described the act as barbaric and inhumane, saying the matter has been reported to the police.  He said, “We found the girl along the street fetching water at night with a swollen face and bruises all over her body. “When we asked her what happened, she could not talk because she had lost her voice while crying. “We quickly reported the matter to the police and the man was summoned together with his wife. He told the police that he beat the girl because he came back from market and there was no water at home for him to bathe. “This man’s first daughter is older than this innocent girl, yet he could not demonstrate his anger on his own daughter for not fetching water.”
