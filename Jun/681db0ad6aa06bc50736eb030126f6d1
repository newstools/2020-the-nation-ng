The Majority Leader of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Hon. SOB Agunbiade, has said he is still in shock over the sudden demise of the late Senator representing Lagos East Senatorial district at the national assembly. Senator Sikiru Adebayo Osinowo passed away in a Lagos isolation centre on Monday morning at the age of 64. Agunbiade lamented that the late lawmaker died at a time his wealth of knowledge is most required by the country. He however described Osinowo as “a man who lived for Nigeria and Nigerians.”  Similarly, another chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), a former gubernatorial candidate in Lagos state, Chief Mrs. Remi Adiukwu, expressed sadness over Osinowo’s death and urge chieftains of the party to close ranks and forgive one another as a mark of honour to the departed politician. “Osinowo was a fine politician and a gentleman. He lived and worked for his constituents while alive. So, let us honour him by forgetting all disagreements and forgiving ourselves in APC,” she said.
