Naira Marley has informed his 3.4 million followers on Instagram that he would be boycotting the services of Executive Jets Services Limited. The singer reacted to the apology of the airline boss, Sam Iwuajoku, saying he and his crew won’t be making use of the airline services. “We won’t be using your airline again for calling us useless,” he said. The singer also took his time to explain the confusion in names saying his kid brother was mistaken for the minister for works, Babatunde Raji Fashola. “My name is Azeez Adeshina Fashola and my Lil brother’s name is Moshood Babatunde Fashola.” The Marlian president went on to throw shades at the airline coy saying the cabin crew begged to give them a shoutout on his social media handles. “Lol, they asked for our names on the jet though and lol your pilot is a Marlian and everybody there is a Marlian too… And you was begging me to tag y’all. Do you know that over 20,000 Marlians travel with executive jet a month? Thank God we didn’t crash on that flight sha because we nearly did. BTW We didn’t book the flight ourselves,” he wrote. Naira Marley also hinted at releasing a new song as he rides on the controversy around his last performance in Abuja and flying on a private jet against the federal government instructions.
