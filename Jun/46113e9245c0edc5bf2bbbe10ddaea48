 THE Nigerian Private Sector Coalition Against COVID-19 (CACOVID) has donated 100 beds to the isolation centre meant for the Almajiris in Niger State. The coalition also donated 100 hospital overhead tables, one mobile x-ray machine, one ultrasound machine, two ICU beds, 20,700 pieces of medical equipment, which include 250 face shields, 1,000 protective goggles, 3,000 KN95 face masks, 4,950 disposable face masks, 10,000 disposable latex gloves, 500 elbow rubber gloves and 1,000 personal protective equipment (PPE). Representative of CACOVID Thomas Gideon Makire stated that the body is supporting state governments in the fight against COVID-19, adding that the fight for survival has become a necessity. â€œThis is why CACOVID, as part of its contribution, is commissioning the Niger State Isolation Centre. The items donated are meant to help in the treatment of the confirmed and suspected patients in the state. Niger State Governor Abubakar Sani Bello hailed the coalition for its support toward the fight against Cthe disease. The governor said though COVID-19 cases in Niger State were still low, the state is working at ensuring that the cases remain at that level. He added that the test centres in Minna and Lapai would soon be ready as they are already waiting for certification from the NCDC team.
