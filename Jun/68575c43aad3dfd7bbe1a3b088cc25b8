A Senior Special Assistant (SSA) to Enugu Governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, has commended the governor for showing exemplary leadership on Democracy Day. Walter Ozioko, a lawyer, said he was thrilled his principal spent the entire holiday inspecting ongoing projects across the state, an act, he said, was aimed at ensuring true dividend of democracy for the people. Ozioko said he was thrilled the governor defined June 12 national holiday by celebrating the gains of democracy, adding that Ugwuanyi inspected projects till odd hours. He said: “What Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi demonstrated is exemplary and should be emulated by other leaders in Nigeria. The Governor is a super leader who has shown by his good works in Enugu state that governance is not about being in power but about the governed getting the dividends of leadership. “For five years running, Enugu State has witnessed unparalleled infrastructural development like the provisions of good road networks and educational facilities. “While many states have forgotten other projects and concentrated on covid-19, Ugwuanyi who is fighting covid-19 with heavy might also feels that life must go on by providing other social amenities.“ Ozioko said the government plans to build ultra modern hospitals in all local governments in the state.
