Ansu Fati has enjoyed a breakthrough season at Barcelona and is not looking to leave the Spanish club with Man Utd supposedly interested in his services Ansu Fati’s father Bori has rejected claims that the 17-year-old Barcelona star will quit the Nou Camp in favour of a move to Manchester United. Ansu has enjoyed a breakthrough campaign and scored six times for the Catalans. Recent reports suggested a £135m bid from United had been tabled and turned down by the La Liga giants. But Ansu’s father insists the teenager is happy at the Nou Camp and is prepared to bide his time with some stellar names ahead of him in the pecking order. “We are enjoying life at Barcelona,’ Bori said in an interview with El Larguero. “But my son must be patient for his chances, as he is playing with the greatest footballer ever in Lionel Messi. “The United links are not true, Ansu is happy here, he is following his dreams. He does not have to start every game, and he has Griezmann and Suarez ahead of him. Ansu has a lot of time.” Barcelona’s recruitment has been very hit and miss in recent seasons but Quique Setien, who only took in this season, will be keen to add his own players. Ansu though is not on his list of players to offload with the 17-year-old poised to sign a new deal with Barcelona that will include a £362m release clause. The Catalans see him as a potential successor to Lionel Messi and club director Xavier Vilajoana also denied they were prepared to cash in on the La Masia graduate. He said: “For us, there’s no story with Ansu, we have never spoken about selling him. We won’t use players from the academy to make cash.
