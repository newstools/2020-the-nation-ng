President, National Union of Chemical Footwear, Rubber, Leather and Non-Metallic Products Employees (NUCFRLANMPE), Mr Goke Olatunji has urged the Federal Government to consider granting tax holiday and other measures to relieve the private sector of the distress brought by the global COVID-19 pandemic. He said the implication of the ongoing pandemic on the private sector could be severe enough to cause the closure of companies and massive job losses. The union requested a tax-free cash flow boost for employers – a stimulus package to help pay wages or for investment to protect against downturn inactivity. He noted that COVID 19 has once again brought up the realisation that any economy dependent on a sole commodity is incapable of sustainable growth, urging the government to take advantage of Nigeria natural and human resources now. “Diversification and incentives from government are key to successful industrialisation. We call on government at all levels to exploit the potential of the agricultural sector. The Small and Medium Scale businesses should also be encouraged because of the critical role it plays in employment generation,” Olatunji said. He also called for improved infrastructure amenities such as good roads, effective power supply and adequate good medical facilities that would carter for the upsurge in the population. Olatunji said the union has urged employers of labour in the sector not to layoff, adding that the union is ready to hold a round table meeting with the employers.
