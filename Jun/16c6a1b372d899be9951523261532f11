French highest administrative court has rejected an effort to restart the Ligue 1 season â€“ but ruled that Amiens and Toulouse should be reprieved from relegation. The French football league decided at the end of April to cancel the 2019-20 season with 10 rounds of matches remaining after the Government declared there would be no professional sport before September. Lyon, who finished seventh in a final table decided by a points-per-game calculation and missed out on European qualification, joined with relegated clubs Amiens and Toulouse in launching legal action.
