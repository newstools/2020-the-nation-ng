 Sokoto State government plans to establish more non-formal learning centres (NFLC) under its Better Education Service Delivery for All (BESDA). Commissioner for Basic and Secondary Education Alhaji Muhammad Gwiwa, said the decision to open more centres was informed by more children expressing their willingness to enrol in the programme. Gwiwa, who spoke while inspecting a NFLC at Rijiyar Kade village in Kware Local Government noted that the development would help reduce the number of out-of-school children in the state. “The commitment of parents and relevant stakeholders will further boost the efforts of the state government towards achieving the set objective,” Gwiwa said. The commissioner praised the facilitators mentoring the pupils, urging them to maintain the tempo. Lead Result Area One BESDA and Director Mobilisation SUBEB,  Kabiru Aliyu said over 71,000 pupils had  been enrolled into the programme.
