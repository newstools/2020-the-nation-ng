The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC ) on Tuesday notified seven electricity distribution companies (DisCos ) of its intention to sanction them for flouting its estimated billing cap. The DisCos are Port Harcourt, Benin, Enugu, Eko, Ikeja, Kano and Kaduna. NERC had given the DisCos four days beginning from June 4, 2020, to explain why they should not penalised for alleged non-compliance. Following complaints by non-metered customers, NERC on February 25 directed all the 11 DisCos to provide them with meters or peg their bills at N1, 800 monthly. Order 197/2020 posted on the regulatory agencyâ€™s Twitter handle by the Chairman, Prof James Momoh and the Commissioner, Legal, Licencing and Compliance, Dafe Akpeneye, amended the 2012 Order on estimated billing regulation. Despite the February order, the companies failed to commence with the new metering rule. Besides, some of the field workers of the DisCos were said to be aiding some fraudulent customers to by- pass the meters.
