 UEFA Champions League knockout games are set to be played in a 12-day condensed tournament in Lisbon in August. The Portuguese capital will host the quarter-finals, semi-finals and final between August 12-23. All ties will be played as single legs across two different stadiums in Lisbon – the Estadio da Luz and the Estadio Jose Alvalade. UEFA’s Executive Committee are expected to approve the new mini tournament at a meeting today. How the four outstanding last-16 matches should be completed has yet to be decided.
