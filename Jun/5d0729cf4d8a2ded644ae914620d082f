Enugu Rangers General Manager Davidson Owumi has confirmed that he voted for Super Six Playoffs to ensure that the top three teams that will represent Nigeria in CAF Inter-club competitions are strong formidable enough to fly the country’s flag. Owumi, who was however quoted by the media department of the club after an emergency Management meeting at the Corporate Headquarters of the Flying Antelopes in Enugu noted that the most credible thing is for the 2019/2020 season to be cancelled if the option of the playoffs was jettisoned. “What I actually submitted was for a ‘Super-Six Playoff’ for the top six teams on the NPFL 2019/2020 log to help produce credible representatives for the country on the continent. Equitably to end the season due to the extraordinary force majeure occasioned by COVID-19 pandemic or cancel the entire process called NPFL 2019/2020 season,” Owumi said. “Equals should be treated equally. For equity, the league should be cancelled which means that the 2019/2020 season did not take place just as it is with Aiteo Cup 2020, NNL 2019/2020 and NLO 2020. There must be a victor and a vanquished (champions and relegated teams) if the PPG option should be implemented,” he added.
