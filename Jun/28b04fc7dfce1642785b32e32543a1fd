The Premier League returns today  after 100 days in the deep freeze, with Liverpool on the brink of winning the title in a radically changed football universe. The English top flight follows Germany’s Bundesliga and La Liga in Spain in rebooting their seasons after the coronavirus lockdown, aiming to cram 92 games into six weeks of breathless action. Aston Villa kick off against Sheffield United, to be followed later by Manchester City vs. Arsenal, before a cascade of matches. Meanwhile, Pep Guardiola has admitted his players ‘are not ready’ for the rigours of matches every three days as Manchester City prepare to restart their season against Arsenal on Wednesday.  The Premier League makes its comeback after a three-month coronavirus hiatus and player fitness levels and match sharpness are a big unknown for the managers. And City boss Guardiola said he won’t know what shape his squad are in for sure until they get back on the pitch. He said: “We are ready to play one game. Three days after and four days after that, we are not ready, not just Man City, all the teams. That is why we have to rotate. “You can play a game after three weeks on holiday but we spent two weeks on the sofa doing nothing much. That is why the players are not fully fit. But that is why we have to finish the season. We have to limit the economic damage to the clubs,” he noted.
