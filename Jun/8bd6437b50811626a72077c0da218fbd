Dradrock Real Estate Limited signed one of Nigeria’s comedian and television personalities, Tee-A also known as ‘Babatunde Adewale, as a brand partner during a brief ceremony that took place at the company’s corporate office in Lekki, Lagos. After the brief signing ceremony, Tee-A was formally presented to a select team of editors and writers. Speaking during the media chat, the MD/CEO of Dradrock Real Estate Limited, Oladipo Idowu-Agida, expressed his satisfaction that the consummation of the brand partnership that has been in the pipeline for sometimes, has eventually become a reality with the public presentation. He carefully traced the touch-points of the company’s connection with Tee-A, which started as a client-customer relationship over a period before it elevated to the present partnership arrangement. “With Tee-A’s level of awareness on real estate and his top-notch influence in the society, I believe this relationship will surely add value to our organisation and businesses,” Idowu-Agida explained. Also commenting after the formal signing of the partnership agreement, Tee-A described his relationship with Dradrock as one that has come a long way and will be mutually beneficial to all partners involved. Although he is known more for comedy and entertainment, he acknowledged that he had been a real estate aficionado for a long time, so the partnership will not only attract goodwill to Dradrock but also strategic advice, suggestions, and counseling. “This partnership will surely boost the positioning of the organisation in the marketplace because of the great value that Dradrock is known for.” Commenting on some long-term internal programs that have kept Dradrock Real Estate Limited on top of her game, Human Capital Development Manager, Temitope Ayanbowale, revealed that diverse training packages for the staff and management ensured excellent performance.
