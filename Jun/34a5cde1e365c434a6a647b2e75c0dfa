A Lagos High Court sitting in Igbosere on Monday sentenced a former official of ExxonMobil, Mr James Onuoha, an engineer, to 15 years imprisonment for raping his tenantâ€™s 14-year-old niece. Justice Adedayo Akintoye sentenced him without an option of fine. The Lagos State prosecuting counsel Mr Babatunde Sunmonu announced his appearance while Dr Victor Olowonla appeared for the defence. Delivering judgment, Justice Akintoye found Onuoha guilty as charged. Defence counsel, Dr Olowonla, pleaded with the court to temper justice with mercy as he was a first-time offender. Notwithstanding, Justice Akintoye said the offence of rape is grievous and sentenced Onuoha to 15 years in the Kirikiri Correctional Centre. She said the sentence would serve to deter other rapists.
