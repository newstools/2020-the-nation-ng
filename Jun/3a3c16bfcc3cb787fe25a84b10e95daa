A top Boko Haram logistics supplier has been arrested in Borno State by men of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC). The state NSCDC commandant, Mr Ibrahim Abdullahi, while parading Bakura Ibrahim, 35, on Thursday in Maiduguri, said he was arrested with a car filled with fuel and food products. Abdullahi said Ibrahim was arrested on June 6 in Maiduguri with “24 Jerry cans of petrol, seven cartons of traditional medicine, 10 bags of fishing hooks and nets, and sex enhancement drugs”. The NSCDC chief said the arrest was made possible with the collaboration of other security agencies. “We have since move forward from sharing intelligence to arresting culprits and handing them to relevant departments for prosecution”. He added that his men have arrested three top Boko Haram terrorists and handed them over to the military this year.
