To protect journalists, the Lagos State Council of National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) on Wednesday donated face masks to Lagos State Council of Nigerian Union Journalists (NUJ). Presenting the masks, NURTW Chairman Musiliu Ayinde Akinsanya, said as members of the fourth estate of the realm, journalists have a vital role to play in educating the public on the guidelines introduced by relevant government agencies in order to curb spread of the virus. He also noted that while gathering information for publication or broadcasting journalists move around and therefore need to be protected from contracting the deadly virus. He described journalists as essential service providers that have continued to give daily report on new, discharged and death cases recorded since the corona virus pandemic took the global stage. Replying, NUJ Chairman Dr. Quasim Akinreti praised NURTW for the kind gesture. He promised that the face mask will be distributed to journalists operating in Lagos. Akinreti said the courtesy visit was to further strengthen the bond between NUJ and NURTW, even as he solicited partnership in the secretariat building project to which the NUJ is committed.
