Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo on Tuesday commissioned a 200,000 capacity yam facility at the Zaki Biam International Market in Benue State. The market is assumed to be the biggest yam market in the world, accounting for about 70% of the yams cultivated in the country with over 200 trucks loading two million tubers of yams weekly. But despite its impressive output, the market has little storage capacity and its infrastructural facilities are way below the size of the commerce that goes on there daily. Hence, the Federal Government deemed it fit to give the market an economic uplift, especially in pursuit of its agricultural reforms. Amongst the facilities also commissioned by VP Osinbajo were 660 units renovated stalls/sheds, a newly-built Police Station and Market Administrative Building as well as eight units of toilet. The market also has a Solar-Powered Borehole with an overhead tank as well as newly constructed and well-linked internal roads with drainage system.
