 KADUNA State Governor Nasir El Rufai has said his administration is deploying improved testing capacity and other public health measures as part of its strategy for the safe reopening of the state. The governor stated this while he was receiving Wellness-on-Wheels, a mobile testing vehicle deployed by United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to support the state’s Covid-19 containment efforts. In a statement issued by Special Adviser on Media and Communication, Mr. Muyiwa Adekeye, yesterday, El Rufai said: “The ongoing FORWARD campaign of the state government, which encourages personal responsibility by citizens, is the most sustainable Covid-19 prevention strategy.” The governor, who expressed gratitude to USAID and KNCV for their contribution to the fight against the spread of COVID-19, said the mobile testing vehicle is already helping to improve the state’s capacity for testing in communities.
