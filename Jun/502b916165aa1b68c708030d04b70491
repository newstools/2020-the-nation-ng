Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike has decried the increasing daily cases of the Coronavirus pandemic in the state. He said Rivers State is gradually becoming the epicentre of the virus in the South-South. Wike, who spoke in Port Harcourt at the weekend, said the state recorded 866 positive cases out of 2,572 tested samples and 30 deaths, including prominent persons. He added that 356 persons recovered and were discharged from treatment centres. For instance, Wike said the state recorded 127 fresh cases on Saturday, insisting that there was no more denying the fact that the virus is dangerous and deadly. He said: “We cannot also deny that the transmission of the virus in our state is currently on a steep upward trend. This being so, we must all brace to the reality of having new infections and a couple of deaths in the coming weeks and months.” But, a former Director-General, Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Dr. Dakuku Peterside, called on the government to establish more testing centres across the state, following the increasing number of positive cases. Peterside spoke following the temporary lockdown of Bonny Local Government Area and Onne in Eleme Local Government Area by Wike.
