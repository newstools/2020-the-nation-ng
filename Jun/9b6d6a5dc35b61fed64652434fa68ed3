 EDO State governorship aspirant, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for bringing into reality the agitation by democratic forces that June 12 be made Democracy Day instead of May 29. The All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship aspirant noted that by choosing June 12 to honour the sacrifice made by the winner of the annulled 1993 presidential election, Moshood Abiola, and other heroes, Buhari did not only demonstrate his commitment to democratic ideals without which true governance is impossible, he also showed loyalty to his message of being the President of all.  He said: “On this day in 1993, Nigerians did what many had thought impossible. They set aside all differences, including religion and ethnicity, and banded together as one people to overwhelmingly entrust their votes in the aspiration of the late Chief M.K.O Abiola and Baba Gana Kinigbe. “It was a fine expression of democracy and an unblemished display of our ability to adopt and embrace a unifying message of hope, even in the face of cynicism and great challenges. “Today, over two decades on that journey, we look back and recount progresses made, obstacles that persist, and how we can further perfect our democracy. There couldn’t have been a better choice of a day to carry out these deep, and important, reflections than June 12.”
