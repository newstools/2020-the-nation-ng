The Federal Government has said issues of multiple taxation, deductions and others related to the payment of universities workers through the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System  (IPPIS) would be addressed. Minister of Labour and Employment, Sen Chris Ngige, stated this on Sunday. Ngige said he has spoken with the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning and Accountant General of the Federation and the government has communicated with university Bursars to correct certain peculiarities and send back for the OAGF and Finance Minister to address. The Minister also said it has received the strike notice from the non-teaching staff unions in universities, saying it was making efforts to meet with the leaderships of the various unions. He said that his office will apply for a special pass from the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 for a physical meeting with the unions to address all the contentious issues raised by the various unions. However, the Joint Action Committee (JAC) which comprises of the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities, (SSANU) and the Non-Academic Staff Union of Universities and Associated Institutions (NASU), said the government doesn’t need to call a meeting before it pays members their full salaries and payment slips. President of SSANU, Samson Ugwoke, said the JAC has already issued a 14-day ultimatum to the government to correct all the problems associated with the payment of salaries through IPPIS. The union also urged the government to release their Earned Allowances before the easing of the lockdown, adding that its members will not resume duty when schools resume if government fails to pay them.
