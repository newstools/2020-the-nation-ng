The Enugu State Ad hoc Expert Medical Advisory Committee (EMAC) on de-escalation of COVID-19 transmission has advised the state government to put in place stricter enforcement measures that will help contain the spread of the virus in the state. Briefing reporters in Enugu on their findings so far, Prof. Emmanuel Ejim, who is the chairman of the 12-man committee constituted by Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, harped on the need for the enforcement of “compulsory wearing of face masks, observing of physical distancing and ensuring hand hygiene”. The committee, which has a two-week duration to submit its report, was mandated to engage with leaders of various religious groups, market associations, professional associations, labour unions, National Union of Road Transport Workers, Enugu State Chapter, Association of Tricycle Riders Transport Union, civil society groups, organised private sector and other relevant stakeholders. Prof. Ejim said their findings revealed that the stakeholders they interfaced with acknowledged the existence of COVID-19, but expressed concerns that the commitment and capacity to enforce the necessary preventive measures “were all being undermined by several factors that we continue to unearth”.
