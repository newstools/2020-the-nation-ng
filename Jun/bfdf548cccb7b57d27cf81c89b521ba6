 PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari has forwarded the name of the Acting President of the Court of Appeal, Justice Monica Dongban-Mensem, to the Senate for substantive confirmation. The President’s decision was contained in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu. It reads: “President Muhammadu Buhari, in line with his constitutional responsibility, has sent the nomination of Her Lordship, Justice Monica Dongban-Mensem, Acting President, Court of Appeal, to the Senate for confirmation as President, Court of Appeal. “Justice Dongban-Mensem is a serving Justice of the Court of Appeal and was recommended, as is the practice, by the National Judicial Council (NJC) for the nomination by the President.” One of those who faulted the President for the position was former Military Administration of Kaduna State, Col. Abubakar Dangiwa Umar (retd.), who also accused him of giving lopsided appointments. The Presidency had reacted to negative comments on President Buhari’s appointments, saying he followed the dictates of the Constitution.
