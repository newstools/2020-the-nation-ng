 The First Lady,Hajiya Aisha Buhari on Friday asked Police Inspector General Mohammed Adamu to release her staff who are in police detention. Mrs. Buhari in a series of tweets said the IGP should “release my assigned Staff who are still in the custody of the Police in order to avoid putting their lives in danger or exposure to Covid-19 while in their custody.” She did not say who among her staff are in detention or how and why they were detained. However, online publication, Sahara Reporters, said  the arrest of some of the First Lady’s staff was instigated by a personal staff of the President  following his ejection from the Presidential Villa for allegedly breaching the COVID-19 safety code. He was said to have recently returned to Abuja from Lagos and failed to observe self-isolation. As the story goes he went to the Villa but was turned back so that the First Family might not be exposed to COVID-19. The President’s aide did not take kindly to his treatment and invited the police to take action against the First Lady’s aides. Mrs. Buhari in one the tweets said:”That Covid-19 is real and still very much around in our nation is not in doubt. Consequently, I call on all relevant Government Agencies to enforce the Quarantine Act signed by Mr. President and ensure no one is found violating this law and the NCDC guidelines…” In another one, she said: “…especially on interstate travel without the necessary exemptions for movement of essentials. Anyone who does that should at the very least be made to under go a 14 days mandatory isolation no matter who the person is, no one should be above the law and the Police command…”
