 United Kingdom-based Aston University is offering between £3000 and £8,000 scholarship to foreign students for the 2020/2021 academic session. The University’s Regional Manager for Africa, Babajide Ogundeji told The Nation that the institution was still accepting students for September. He said with employability at the centre of the institution’s value to students, they could be assured of getting quality education experience.  “The university has a dedicated team working closely with UK and international employers and partner universities to source and promote placement opportunities to Aston students, and also organise employer events and recruitment fairs on campus to bring employers and students closer together. ‘’Students can take up paid placements of up to £15,000, giving them the opportunity to apply what they have learnt on their course in the real world whilst gaining valuable professional and paid experience. In many master’s courses, students can take an extended work placement of up to 12 months with the Aston Global Advantage and choose to study abroad in Europe and beyond,” he said.
