The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) on Monday launched its community policing initiative with the inauguration of a 16-member State Community Policing Advisory Committee (SCPAC). Minister of the FCT, Malam Muhammad Bello, expressed optimism that with the presidential approval granted for the implementation of community policing, Nigerians would begin to see a reduction in crime rate. “It is essential to remind them that community policing is a strategy that is anchored on trust between and the people and the security officers. “Once there is a trust deficit in any guise or form, the workability of this policy becomes highly diminished and we would have lost a great opportunity in improving the security profile of the territory,” he said.
