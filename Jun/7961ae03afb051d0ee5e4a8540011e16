A 27-year-old man, Taiwo Olatunde, was on Tuesday arraigned before an Ado-Ekiti Chief Magistratesâ€™ Court over alleged defilement of two teenagers. The defendant of no fixed address was brought before Chief Magistrate, Mrs Adefumike Anoma, on on a count charge bordering on rape. The prosecutor, Inspector Monica Ikebuilo, told the court the defendant committed the offence on June 9 in Ado-Ekiti. She alleged the defendant defiled a 13-year-old and 14-year-old girl. Ikebuilo said the two victims were friends, and the defendant, a tailor promised them to sow a nose mask for them. She added when the victims got to his house, he locked the door and threatened to kill them with a knife if they shouted, stating he defiled them one after the other, but was caught in the act with the intervention of his neighbour. She said the offence contravened Section 2 (2) of Ekiti State Gender Based Violence (prohibition) Amended Law 2019. The prosecutor urged the court to remand the defendant in the Correctional Centre pending legal advice from the office of Director of Public Prosecution (DPP). The plea of the defendant was not taken. Chief Magistrate, Anoma, consequently remanded the defendant at the Correctional Centre and adjourned the case until July 27 for mention.
