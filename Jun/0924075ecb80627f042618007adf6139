 MRS. Florence Ajimobi, ex-governor Abiola Ajimobi’s widow, has slammed the Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde administration for the way it handled her late husband’s case in the last one month that he was bedridden. She said her husband was for peace and served the state for eight years, making him to deserve better treatment, even in death. The widow denied ever contacting either Governor Makinde or anybody in his government for any support during her husband’s illness, denying claims by the governor that the family sent a proxy. She spoke while receiving a delegation of the governors who were at her Oluyole home to commisserate with the family and pay their last respect. The delegation was led by the Oyo State Deputy Governor, Mr Rauf Olaniyan. Mrs. Ajimobi said although she was not supposed to talk, she spoke for the first time since her husband fell ill about a month ago and eventually died because of the misgivings that had emanated from the government. Appealing to the govenrment to stop what she described as dirty politics, Mrs. Ajimobi said her late husband was for peace and served the state for eight years, making him to deserve better treatment, even in death.
