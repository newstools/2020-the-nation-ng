Notorious football bad boy Mario Balotelli looks to be on the verge of the sack from current club Brescia. The Italian forward, 29, is onto his eighth club having struggled to settle at any of his former employers for more than a few seasons. But local reports suggest Brescia owner Massimo Cellino has already had enough of the star, who only joined the club last August. Ex-Leeds chief Cellino is said to have written to Balotelli requesting for his contract with Brescia to be terminated.  Balotelli still has over two years of his three-year deal left to run, but Cellino has been irked by the striker persistently missing training. Mario Balotelli is set to become a free agent after getting sacked by Brescia Brescia have been preparing for the Serie A restart, but Balotelli has been missing in action, as he has failed to turn up to several sessions. His contract with the club includes a break clause at the end of this season if Brescia are relegated, which looks likely, given they are nine points adrift from safety at the foot of the table.
