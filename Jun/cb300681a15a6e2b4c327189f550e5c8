Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has unveiled plans to construct an International Infectious Disease Research Centre at the Mainland Infectious Disease Hospital, Yaba, as part of his administration’s response and infectious diseases preparedness in post-pandemic era. Sanwo-Olu stated this at the official inauguration of 150-bed Mainland Infectious Disease Isolation Centre donated by Private Sector Coalition Against COVID-19 (CACOVID) to the state. The governor said his administration would also erect a purpose-built doctors’ quarters and permanent isolation wards to ramp up capacity for any infectious disease outbreak as part of the global master plan for the Mainland Infectious Disease Hospital, Yaba. Sanwo-Olu, however, noted that beyond putting up isolation facility for COVID-19 case management, it is important for citizens to understand the need to take responsibility against the pandemic. Commissioner for Health Prof. Akin Abayomi explained that the facility has a fully contained PCR laboratory, a routine laboratory, a bouquet of administrative and ancillary facilities, a water treatment plant, a waste management system and three power generators for case management. Managing Director Access Bank Plc Herbert Wigwe hailed the government and the governor for the timely and good response against the COVID-19 pandemic. Sanwo-Olu on Monday announced the discharge of 93 more Covid-19 patients from Lagos facilities to reunite with the society. They include 16 females and 77 males of which 11 are foreign nationals.
