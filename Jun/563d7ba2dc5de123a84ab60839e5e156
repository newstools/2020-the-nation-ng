Sterling Bank Plc has donated 5,000 customized reflective uniforms to Lagos State Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) in a bid to make highways managers in Lagos State safe as they work at dawn and dusk to keep the environment safe. Regional Business Executive, Institutional Banking (Lagos region), made the donation to the Acting Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Lagos State Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) in Lagos recently. Speaking at the presentation ceremony, Mrs. Oladunni said the bank will continually engage in initiatives that will protect the environment especially those that are connected to the protection of lives through its partnership with LAWMA. She said the donation of the reflective highway managers uniforms to LAWMA “is one of the ways the bank contributes to the wellbeing of skilled and unskilled workers in the communities in which it does business across the country.” Commenting, Mr. Odunmboni remarked that, “Sterling Bank has been supporting us over the years and today they have donated another 5, 000 uniforms to us again for the kitting of our sweepers.” He said the uniforms came at a time the authority had just expanded the number of sweepers across the state, noting that the donation will be adequate for distribution to all the sweepers on its payroll. He appealed to the management of the bank to continue its good gesture to LAWMA and other agencies of the Lagos State Government.
