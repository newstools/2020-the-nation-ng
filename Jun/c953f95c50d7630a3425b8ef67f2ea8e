A middle-aged man, identified as Babangida Eluemuno has been arrested for allegedly stabbing to death, a teenager, Arinze Omeh at his residence, 9 Agba street, Inland town, Onitsha, Anambra state. The deceased, a trader at Onitsha main market but hails from Enugwu-Ezike community in Igbo-Eze North Local Government Area of Enugu state, was allegedly stabbed following a brawl. Elder brother to the deceased, Oluchukwu Omeh, told newsmen that trouble ensued when the suspect, a son to the landlord to the deceased, his tenant, told him to stop using a broom meant for sweeping inside the house to sweep outside. Oluchukwu who claimed to have witnessed the incident stated, “On that fateful day, I returned home with Arinze, my younger brother from the market. “As we sat down within the compound to rest and discuss our family matters, Babangida came out and warned my late brother to stop using the broom meant for sweeping the compound to sweep rooms. “In a reply, Arinze told Babangida that he had heard him because he had already sounded this same warning to him earlier in the morning.” Oluchukwu however said the response from the suspect angered his late brother who rushed towards his direction and landed a heavy slap on him. “It was in attempt to rescue Arinze from the grip of Babangida that he used a broken bottle and stabbed him on the left wrist and while he was still trying to control the blood, Babangida again reached for his broken down tricycle, picked up a knife,” he added. Oluchukwu however said he quickly hired a tricycle and rushed his late brother to the General Hospital but was rejected by the hospital authorities over alleged complications. “By the time we could rush Arinze to a nearby private hospital, the medical personnel confirmed him dead on arrival and his lifeless body was taken to a morgue and deposited. The Police spokesperson, Haruna Mohammed, confirmed the incident, saying the matter was being investigated.
