The Court of Appeal in Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State, on Thursday affirmed the death sentence passed on one Michael Ochong in 2016. A high court on June 11, 2016, sentenced Ochong to death by hanging for murder. The convict approached the appellate court, seeking to upturn the decision. Director of Public Prosecution Julius Ajibare, who led the prosecution team argued that the case lacked merit. Justice Obi Elechiu affirmed the trial court’s judgment and dismissed the convict’s appeal.
