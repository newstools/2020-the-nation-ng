Katsina Governor Aminu Masari has declared he has no political ambition after 2023. He insisted he won’t aspire to any political office after leaving office as a two-term Governor. Masari, who spoke with reporters at Government House Katsina, said he would rather prefer giving opportunities to the younger ones to emerge. He said that is because he would be 73 by 2023. The former House of Representatives Speaker said: ’’ I made my positions very clear, as far as my plans are concerned. “I have no intention of contesting any election after this, I never thought I will be a politician and politics was not part of my wildest imagination but fate brought me into politics. ‘’I didn’t drive myself but fate and I never thought being a commissioner will bring me into politics because if I had known, I might have not accepted it because I was not sure that I will be a good politician because I am a technical person and was never an administrator until when I reached the position so my plan is not to contest and not to retire into senate. I am not going to and God willing by 2023, I will be 73years old and by that time, I am out.’’
