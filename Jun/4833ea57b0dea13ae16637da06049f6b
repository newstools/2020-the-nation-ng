A blogging contest by Readmanna Empowerment Initiative (REI) has opened for teachers to win prizes totaling about N4 million. Chief Executive Officer, Readmanna, Mrs Edna Agusto, said in a statement that the top 25 blogs that emerge during the contest would get between N25,000 and N1,000,000 in prize money. She said teachers have until August 31, 2020 to register their blogs for the contest aimed at improving their use of technology and creativity in teaching and learning. “The Top 25 blogs will be selected by a panel of Judges and winners will be declared in October 2020. N4million cash will be given to the top 25 blogs. “Today, computer technology is the primary driver of growth in all spheres of life. COVID-19 has revealed that most teachers in Nigeria have little or no digital skills and cannot deliver online training effectively. In a post COVID-19 era, online training will become a necessity for all, including teachers. The MCE certification empowers teachers to engage students in a digital environment. “This blogging contest will encourage teachers to create relevant and current educational content required in schools. If truly data is the new currency or oil, Nigeria certainly is sitting on a huge amount of untapped data! Indeed, no country can grow or develop in this modern age without a digitally literate population. “Teachers are invited to create and register their educational blogs in this contest before 31 August 2020. Religious and political blogs are prohibited. A teacher can only submit one blog,” she said. While the overall winner gets N1 million, the second and third placed would get N750,000 and N500,000 each.  The fourth and fifth would win N250,000; while the sixth-10th placed winners go home with N100,000 each. Those that fall within 11th-15th category would be rewarded with N75,000; 16th-20th, N50,000; and 21st-25th, N25,000 each. To participate, Mrs. Agusto said all teachers must be Microsoft Certified Educators (MCE) – a certification that “validates a teacher’s ability to integrate ICT into teaching and learning”. She said teachers are required to register with N13,000 entry fee which covers the cost of MCE online training and the certification exam. Already qualified MCE teachers will get Microsoft Office Specialist practice and exam voucher in lieu. Since 2009, Mrs. Agusto said REI has been promoting digital literacy in schools through various competitions like ReadManna Under 13 Computing Fundamentals National Competition (Ages 8 -13); Microsoft Office Specialist World Championship for Students (Ages 13 – 22); Adobe Certified Associate World Championship for Students (Ages 13 – 22); among others.
