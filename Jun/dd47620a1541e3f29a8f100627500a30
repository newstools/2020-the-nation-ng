 A MAJOR strategy of Sunu Assurance Plc is to contain the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) with Personal Protective Equipment (PPE),  the Managing Director, Sunu Health, Dr Patrick Korie, has said said. He stated this when the firm donated PPE to the Lagos State Teaching Hospital (LUTH). A representative of the Chief Medical Director of the teaching hospital, Dr Chris Bode/its Deputy Chairman, Medical Advisory Committee, Clinical Services, Dr Ayodeji Oluwole, at the presentation of the items, said they came at a time the hospital was almost running out of the equipment. He said in the last few weeks, they had about 100 of Covid-19 positive patients. He said while many were still on admission, they had delivered two Covid-19 positive pregnant women. “We are really running short of these supplies of PPE equipment and Sunu Group has just donated them to us at a very good time. I am sure the health workers will be praying for the company. The equipment are exactly what we need for the frontline workers. It’s very important because we have a block with four floors and 120 beds. We have about 100 patients, meaning you need about 100 workers. They all have to wear these and they go in to check on the patients like four to five times a day. “Before you know it, all these will be consumed between two and three weeks. It’s something you use and incinerate. So, it is a very timely donation and we are appreciative of it because this is what we really need. We are running short.’’ We thought the pandemic was going to last for like four weeks but this is the second month. If you count February, this is the third month. So it’s something that we need more from well-meaning donors like Sunu Group,” he noted. The Managing Director, Sunu Assurance Plc, Mr. Samuel Ogbodu, said the company was happy to donate the consumables- masks, googles and overalls – that are  vital to health workers on the frontline of containing the disease.
