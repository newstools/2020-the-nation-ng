Ever since the news of the novel coronavirus pandemic broke in Wuhan, China and its eventual spread to other countries, governments, corporate organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), religious groups and individuals have been doing all they could to ameliorate the situation, pending when a vaccine is finally discovered. While Nigerian celebrities continue to contribute to preventing further spread of the virus, popular Disc Jockey, Akinleye Soyinka, better known as  DJ Nu Kidd, a fast rising Nigerian-American DJ in America has unveiled plans to do his bit in curbing continuous spread of the virus. According to the skilled DJ who has been making waves in the United States of America, he would be distributing fifty thousand (50,000) face masks in New York and New Jersey, as part of measures put in place to curtail further spread of the virus. He said; “This pandemic is a very deadly one. It’s quite unfortunate we have to deal with such at a time when resources should’ve been channeled into something more productive. “Distributing 50,000 face masks in New York and New Jersey is my own way of sensitizing the public on the need to always wear it to prevent further spread of the deadly virus, if we actually want it to become history.”
