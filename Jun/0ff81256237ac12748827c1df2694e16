 THE Prof. Maurice Iwu led Task Force Committee on COVID-19 in Imo State has said that contact tracing of active cases in the state is in full swing. Prof. Iwu spoke on Wednesday in Owerri on the 86 coronavirus cases recorded in the state. Briefing reporters at the Task Force Office, the task force chairman said only 12 cases are active from 86 cases, adding that they are being treated at two different centres in Owerri â€“ six at FMC Isolation Centre and another six at Well-being Centre along Orlu Road, also in Owerri. The gender spread, he said, is three females and nine males. Prof. Iwu added that the contact tracing of the active cases is in top gear as suspect cases are yet to be reached. He reiterated that Imo State has not yet recorded any official coronavirus death from those in the isolation centres. He, however, regretted that a case of COVID-19 death was reported on Saturday in Imo State of somebody who died at his house, but whose blood sample tested positive to the pandemic. The chairman said when new cases are identified or reported, they are evacuated from their homes to a Well-Being Isolation Centre from where they are distributed to other isolation centres to avoid congestion and multiple spread. Prof. Iwu urged anyone that has the trace of infected persons or suspects to the coronavirus disease to report to the committee, emphasising that the virus is real, even though many are still in doubt of its existence.
