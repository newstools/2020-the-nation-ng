Gunmen have killed two persons in the fishing communities of Ayadehe and Mbiabo in Oku Iboku, Itu local government area of Akwa Ibom State. Scores of persons were said to have sustained life-threatening injuries while others are reported missing after the hoodlums attacked the communities in the early hours of Monday and Tuesday. The council chairman, Etetim Onuk, on Wednesday called on the State and Federal Governments come to the aid of the fishing community and forestall further loss of lives and properties. “I condemn the incessant and unprovoked attack on the riverine communities of Oku Iboku, Ayadehe and Mbiabo Clans by armed marauders. “I am saddened by this unpleasant development and therefore appeal to the federal Government to beef up security in creeks by introducing a 24-hour military and police marine patrol along the waterways bordering the affected communities”, Onuk said. He said a situation where armed marauders invade from the creeks, kill and maim at will was not acceptable, hence the urgent need to act so as to complement the efforts of the military and other security agents stationed on land. While commending the Akwa Ibo Governor Udom Emmanuel for his efforts towards ending the protracted crisis, the Itu Council boss lamented the huge losses the people suffer whenever this happens. He condoled with the families of the slain fishermen and farmers, advising them to remain calm and ignore the urge to retaliate as the government would do all within its power to ensure they are safe.
