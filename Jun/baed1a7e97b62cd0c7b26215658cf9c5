Latest reports in France claimed that Lille are now ready to sell Nigeria international, Victor Osinhen for a reduced €45m (£40m) fee, as opposed the €80m (£72m) as had previously been reported. The Super Eagles forward has enjoyed a stellar debut season in Ligue 1, notching 18 goals across all competitions. The Nation reports the 21-year-old’s rapid rise has attracted the attentions of many of the Premier League’s heavy hitters, with Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham the clubs most frequently linked. Indeed, Lille president Gerard Lopez confirmed the Premier League interest when he revealed he “turned down one English” bid in the January transfer window and that he would be seeking a fee on par with the money they received from Arsenal for Nicolas Pepe last summer. However, Le 10 Sport claims in an exclusive that Osimhen’s price is actually around the €45m mark and that talks had been held over a potential move to Liverpool this summer. That’s a claim ratified by Spanish outlet Don Balon, who also claim the knockdown fee has alerted Real Madrid to his potential signing, with the Nigeria said to favour a move to the Bernabeu above all others. This follows reports in Italy on Wednesday which also state Osimhem is also wanted by Napoli as they target a replacement for departing Polish striker Arkadiusz Milik this summer.
