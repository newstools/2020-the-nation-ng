 ECOBANK Nigeria’s agency banking initiative, also known as Xpress Points, is building entrepreneurs and pushing financial inclusion to the  unbanked and under-banked. The lender says its Xpress Points enable its agents to carry out transactions for the bank and earn commission. The consumer experience is very good as customers can make simple deposits, payments and transfers in their own neighbourhood rather than travel for hours to a bank branch, Nike Kolawole, Head, Agency Banking, Ecobank Nigeria, said. According to her, the aim of the Xpress Point is to let every  household has access to Ecobank services within their neoghbourhood to provide easy banking. Kolawole urged unemployed and retired persons  to avail themselves the opportunity to earn extra income by keying into  Xpress Points. She said the Ecobank Xpress points, which are in various neighbourhoods across the country, are well-positioned to facilitate basic financial transactions, with the process and services simplified to attend to a broad spectrum of the society. She said agency banking  brings about economic and youth empowerment through job creation and earning extra income, adding that small savers could do their savings at home or near their home. This leads to financial inclusion of the underbanked.
