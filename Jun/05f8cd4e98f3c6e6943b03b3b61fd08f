  Celta Vigo host LaLiga champions Barcelona in Galicia this evening, with games running out for the Célticos to pick up the points they will need to avoid relegation. They are 16th  on the LaLiga table, six points above bottom-placed Espanyol and four above Mallorca, who occupy the last safe position. At the other end of La Liga, Barca are level with Real Madrid at the summit and boosted by their 1-0 win over Athletic Bilbao on Tuesday courtesy of a 71th minute strike from Ivan Rakitic. Lionel Messi scored a hat trick when both teams last met in November 2019 with the Catalans triumphing with a 4-1 score at Camp Nou. Meanwhile, Celta has won twice since the return of La Liga after the forced COVID-19 break. They beat Deportivo Alavés 6-0 on Sunday after suffering a 1-0 home defeat to Villareal and a goalless away draw to Real Valladolid. A slender 1-0 win at Real Sociedad leaves them 16th  in the league standings with 33 points, seven clear of the relegation zone. Barcelona on the other hand beat Mallorca 4-0 away on their La Liga return and dispatched Leganes 2-0 before a goalless draw with Sevilla allowed rivals Real Madrid top the league on a better head-to-head record. Unbeaten in three straight games, Celta have won their last two games by a combined 7-0 score but have the sixth worst home club in Spain. It worth mentioning that Barcelona won the last meeting with Celta, triumphing with a 4:1 score at Camp Nou back in November 2019. The previous one have ended in Celta victory, again at home, as none of the last eleven   head –to-head clashes was won by the visiting teams. Three of the last five encounters featured over 2,5 goals, while two witnessed goals at both ends. Barca have failed to win any of their previous five visits to Balaidos Stadium, earning just two draws in the process. These two clubs have met 115 times in the past and Barcelona holds a commanding 64-28-23 advantage. Barcelona won the reverse fixture 4-1 back in early November.
