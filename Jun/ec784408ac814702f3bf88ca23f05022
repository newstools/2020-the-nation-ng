Ondo Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, who on Tuesday tested positive for COVID-19, has begun treatment at home. Akeredolu said he is still very strong to continue working from home where he is self- isolating. The Governor stated that he had malaria few days ago and was advised to undergo COVID-19 test by a colleague Governor. According to him: “The result came out today and I tested positive. I am not feeling sick neither am I feeling odd. My doctors have decided I should take the normal treatment and self isolate. “They believe supervised home management should be ideal for me. I will be isolated and go on with home management. There are many of us like this that do not have the symptoms. It is there, you cannot see it. You will not see the symptoms.
“Work is going on. At home, I am attending to files. I appealed to my political associates to continue the work. “Few days time I will do another test. Work is going on. We are sure to win. I am gifted to get through to my destination. I am a man with special gift. My trust in God to through this is unshaken. I pray to God for his hand of healing to get through to us. I thank God for the discovery of this on time.”
