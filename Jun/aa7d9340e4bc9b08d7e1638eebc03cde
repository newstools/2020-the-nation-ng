The Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi has disclosed that his ministry is not in a hurry to commence train ride. The Minister also said when the train operation commences, the train would not move if passengers refuse to comply with safety precautions. Train operation was suspended following the outbreak of COVID-19 as part of measures to curb the spread of the virus. The Presidential Task Force (PTF), on COVID-19 had last week disclosed that rail transport would resume shortly after domestic flight resumes operation. The National Coordinator of the PTF, Sani Aliyu said rail transport would commence as soon as the ban on inter-state travel is lifted. The Minister however disclosed the ministry position via his official twitter handle @ChibuikeAmaechi. The tweet reads: “We’re not in a hurry to start train operations because of the danger of covid19 spread. “When we start, all health and safety protocols must apply. You will not enter a train if you don’t adhere to our rules. “The train will not move if passengers do not comply.
