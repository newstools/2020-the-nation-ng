Police on Monday paraded two men suspected to have been involved in the kidnap and murder of a doctor, Audu Benedict, his son, Iranum, and a family friend after collecting N7.5 million ransom in Benue State. The suspects, Tehile Tsavbee and Gwa Tekula Henry, were paraded alongside 25 other suspects for offences ranging from kidnapping, robbery and illegal possession of firearms, among others. Force spokesman Frank Mba said Tsavbee and Henry were part of a kidnap gang led by one Tena, who is still at large, that have been terrorising Benue. Mba said the victims were abducted on their way to Abuja. The gang also kidnapped one Veronica, a sister to one of the suspects, Henry, who was later released after a ransom of N500, 000. Mba said, â€œThis is the kidnapping syndicate that took Dr Audu Benedict, a native of Taraba State, his son Iranun Audu and a family friend who were on their way to Abuja, ambushed them on the way and killed them somewhere around Benue State. The family of the doctor paid a ransom of N7 million to these criminals. The doctor also raised a check N500,000 which one of the suspects personally cashed out in the bank. Tsavbee reportedly confessed that he carried out the act, but Tena, his boss, carried out the killings. He said he did not know why the victims were killed. He said he got N300, 000 as his share. Mba said the ringleader of the group, Jerome Matthew, was in custody, adding that six AK-47 rifles and several other weapons were recovered from the suspects.
