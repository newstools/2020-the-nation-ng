 Some members of the Lagos State Executive Council including the Governor and his wife Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu and Dr. (Mrs) Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu as well as the State’s Deputy Governor Dr. Obafemi Hamzat has joined officials of the State’s Ministry of Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation to make a renewed call against all forms of abuses and domestic violence. Speaking during the sensitization campaign which kicked off at the JJT Park, Alausa, the Commissioner for Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation, Mrs. Bolaji Dada decried the increasing rate of rape and other gender based violence in recent times, saying that no efforts should be spared to combat the vices. She explained that the involvement of the State Governor and some other political office holders in the campaign affirms the seriousness which the administration of Mr. Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu has for domestic related violence.  He said “This walk organised by Lagos State Government through the Ministry of Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation was to further drive home the message against the menace. I can assure Lagosians that the state government would work hard with its police command and all relevant agencies to reduce the crime minimally.” She emphatically warned that no offender of any of the domestic related crime would go unpunished, saying that rape, domestic violence and child abuse are crimes and must be treated as such and appropriate sanctions instituted again offenders. While saying that the abuses are no respecter of any gender, Mrs. Dada pleaded with women and men to co-exist peacefully and with respect for their individual differences. She, however, encouraged victims of these acts to open up to necessary authorities including the Ministry of Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation whenever their rights are infringed upon, noting that the government will take up such issues and ensure that justice prevails.
