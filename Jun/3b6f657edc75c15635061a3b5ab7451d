 FORMER FA Cup champions Manchester United and Chelsea have been pitched against each other in the semi-final of the tournament on July 18 and 19 at Wembley Stadium. Manchester United beat Norwich City 2-1 in the quarterfinal on Saturday while substitutes made the difference as Chelsea and Arsenal both won away from home to reach the FA Cup semi-finals on Sunday. Chelsea midfielder Ross Barkley turned in a cross from Willian midway through the second half in a 1-0 win at lacklustre Leicester. Spanish midfielder Dani Ceballos netted an injury-time winner in a 2-1 win at Sheffield United, which had two goals ruled offside by video replay. Ceballos pounced with a low shot, just four minutes after David McGoldrick had equalised from close range. Arsenal will face Manchester City in the second semi-final at Wembley after defending champion Man City beat Newcastle 2-0.
