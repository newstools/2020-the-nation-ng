Nigeria international, Samuel Chukwueze was voted the Man of The Match after his superb performance for Villarreal in a 1-0 victory over RCD Mallorca on Tuesday. The Super Eagles forward, who featured for the entire duration of the encounter held at the Estadio de la Ceramica was also named The Most Stylish Player of the Match. “The award @sastreriajajoan The Most Stylish Player of the Match is for Samuel Chukwueze,” the Spanish club tweeted after the match. Chukwueze set up Carlos Bacca for the only goal of the game on 16 minutes. The 21-year-old flicked past his marker, drove into the Mallorca box and delivered a low pass across for the Colombia striker to finish into an empty net in the six-yard box. The Nigerian forward, who was a torn-in-the-flesh for Mallorca defender all night, made seven successful take-on-the most by anyone on the pitch- made three passes and also won three tackles and one interception. According to statistics made available by Whoscore.com, the Nigerian got overall rating 8.1 points ahead of Villarreal goalkeeper Sergio Asenjo (7.9), Mallorca’s Juan Hernández (7.9), Villarreal duo of Pau Torres (7.2) and Raúl Albiol (7.2). Chukwueze is becoming Villarreal’s most important player since La Liga restart. He also provided an assist in Villarreal’s 1-0 win away at Celta Vigo last Saturday. He is also expected to continue his form when Villarreal take on Granada at the Estadio Nuevo Los Cármenes (Granada) on Friday.
