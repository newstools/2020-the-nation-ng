Plateau State Government has lifted the lockdown imposed on the state to check the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. But the curfew imposed by the Federal Government from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. would persist. The order, which would be in place until further notice, takes effect from June 11, the government said yesterday. The government recently reviewed the lockdown to be observed from Monday to Wednesday after consultations with stakeholders. Governor Simon Lalong at a news conference at the  Government House, Jos, said the measure was part of efforts to restore economic activities. Lalong said findings showed that attention was diverted to combating COVID-19 pandemic to the detriment of other diseases such as hypertension and diabetes, which he said, had led to many fatalities. He stressed that people must wear face masks in public places, saying defaulters would be penalised and prosecuted by the mobile courts established for defaulters of COVID-19. ”Churches and Mosques with large spaces shall be allowed to accommodate more than 50 worshippers under strict observance of the use of face masks, social distancing, hand washing, use of infrared thermometers and use of sanitisers,”he said. Lalong said cultural festivals, anniversaries and large scale gatherings remain banned, adding that commercial motorcycles were also banned except dispatch riders and other essential service operators.
