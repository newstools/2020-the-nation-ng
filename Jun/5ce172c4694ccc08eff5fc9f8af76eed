Cristiano Ronaldo has come under angry criticism from Juventus coach Maurizio Sarri after the Turin club lost the Coppa Italia to Napoli on penalties, meaning the winger has lost back-to-back finals for the first time ever. Juve went down 4-2 on penalties to Napoli in Wednesday’s final at Rome’s Stadio Olimpico following a 0-0 draw after normal time, the second consecutive domestic final Ronaldo has lost with The Old Lady of Turin after the defeat in the Supercoppa Italiana against Lazio in December, in which he also failed to score. “He’s in the same shame as the others, like Paulo Dybala and Douglas Costa, he is lacking the sharpness to do what works best for him,” Sarri said, while adding that he “didn’t say much” to the players after the game, as in times of anger and disappointment, silence is the best option.
