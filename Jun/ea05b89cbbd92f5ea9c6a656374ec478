Leganes defender  Kenneth Omeruo has hailed the impact of  late Stephen Keshi with  an emotional tribute to mark the fourth anniversary of the  death of the  former Super Eagles coach. Fondly called the Big Boss, Keshi, reportedly  died  following a heart attack  on  June 7th 2016 after he and Omeruo who made his  Super Eagles debut under him wrote on his social media account that the one- time Eagles’ skipper was more than just a coach to him. He reminisced on how it was like with him when he got his Eagles’ breakthrough, some of the obstacles to the 2013 AFCON crown, and other accomplishments in his career including his time with Chelsea and Keshi’s insatiable desire to ensure he becomes a great player. “It’s been four years already and  I am still hoping I would one day pick  up the phone and call you like I used to,” Omeruo penned. “I miss you…But I am sad I am very sad that I am beginning to get used to your absence. But one thing I will never forget, is your advice, your encouraging words. “You gave me more than one chance and you told me several times, until it stuck to my head, that everyone cannot love me. You told me to work hard always and not expect to be favoured because hard work always win, “ he  wrote inter alia.
