The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) on Tuesday said Rivers Governor Nyesome Wike lacks democratic credentials to faul activities of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) in view of his inglorious roles when the then Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) administration introduced the “16 is greater than 19” political formula. APC Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Yekini Nabena, took a swipe at Wike during a brief chat with newsmen in Abuja. Wike, on Monday, had descibed the NGF as a toothless bulldog, saying it had gone into coma under the APC over the failure to save Edo Governor Godwin Obaseki for seeking reelection on APC’s platform. But Nabena said Wike was still living in the past when impunity was the order of the day, asking him to wake up to the reality of a new era of justice, fairness and true democracy under the administration of the APC. He said: “the Governors Forum is well alive under civilised Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi. “Does Governor Nyesom Wike think Nigerians can forget in a hurry the major role he (Woke) as a PDP minister played when the then Rivers State Governor, Rotimi Amaechi scored 19 votes, but former Plateau State Governor, Jonah Jang who scored 16 votes was recognised as Chairman of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum? “Wike also needs to reminded on the major role he played as a foot soldier who engineered the banning of the then Bayelsa State Governor Timipre Sylva from participating in the PDP governorship primary election scheduled in 2011. “If the Nigeria Governors’ Forum has been “killed” as Wike states, it is clear who the killer and grave digger is.”
