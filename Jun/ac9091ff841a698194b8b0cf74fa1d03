A Federal High Court sitting in Lagos Thursday temporarily forfeited to the Federal Government the N250million diverted from the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) by a contractor. Justice Rilwan Aikawa made the interim order following an ex-parte application filed by Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) counsel Usman Buhari. Buhari told the judge that the contractor illegally diverted the sum from the NDDC, through a contract awarded by the Federal Government. He also prayed for an order directing the publication of the interim forfeiture in a national newspaper for anyone interested to, within 14 days, show why a final order of forfeiture should not be made on the sum in the governmentâ€™s favour. Justice Aikawa, in a short ruling, granted all the reliefs and adjourned further proceedings till July 9, 2020
