 The Vice-Chancellor (VC), Bowen University, Iwo, Osun State, Prof. Joshua Ogunwole, has said the institution has commenced second-semester examination online. Ogunwole noted that the second semester examination of 2019/2020 will be phased.  The first phase began on Monday, June 1, 2020. A statement by the institution’s Head of Information, Protocol and Public Relations, Mr. Toba Adaramola, noted that the VC advised the students to carefully read the guidelines for the online examination published on the University website. He also advised the students not to allow distractions and interference during the online examination, while urging parents to limit their meddling. He noted that students defaulting in fees would not participate in the online exam but would be allowed to take the examination at a later date after completing their fees. Warning against examination malpractice, he said: “Students are reminded that the university has zero-tolerance for examination malpractices and irregularities and are further asked not to block the cameras of their computers while the examination is ongoing.” Bowen University moved classes online in March with directive to Academic staff to teach, upload materials and interact with the students real-time using the Bowen Smart School Hub (SSHUB), a platform designed for robust learning interaction.
