Oyo House of Assembly on Friday approved extension of the tenure of caretaker chairmen of the 33 local government areas and administrators of the 35 Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs) by six months. The approval, which was unanimously agreed upon by the lawmakers, was sequel to a letter from Governor Seyi Makinde requesting for the action. The Nation had reported the Assembly approved appointment of all the 68 caretaker chairmen and administrators on December 19, 2019. Their six-month expires today but their tenure has been extended to December 19, 2020 While justifying the granting of the request, Speaker Ogundoyin said the extension was to avoid any vacuum in the administration of the local councils in Oyo State. The chairman House Committee on Local Government Matters, Mr Ademola Popoola, (Ibadan South East 2), who read the committeeâ€™s report on financial activities of the LGAs and LCDAs in the last six month, said the caretaker chairmen and sole adminstrators had done well to deserve the tenure extension. Popoola urged the House to direct the LGAs and LCDAs to forward their proposed list of projects to the House for approval in line with section 19 (2) and (3) of the Local Government Law, 2001.
