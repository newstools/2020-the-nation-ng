 ACADEMIC activities will not resume until adequate safety measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 are put in place across schools in Delta State. Commissioner for Information Mr. Charles Aniagwu stated this while briefing reporters in Warri, adding that schools may not open next week. Reports had indicated that primary and secondary schools were to resume on Monday, June 8. But, Aniagwu noted that necessary precautions, including fumigation of schools’ environment, have to be done before pupils and students could return to classrooms. “Schools might not resume in next week. We will put all measures in place before children will be allowed to resume academic activities. “We will fumigate the schools to ensure the safety of our children. So, schools might not resume next week,” the commissioner stated. The Nation visited some private and public schools located in Warri and observed that there were yet to be signs of preparation for resumption. Most were deserted and filled with overgrown weeds, especially the public schools.
