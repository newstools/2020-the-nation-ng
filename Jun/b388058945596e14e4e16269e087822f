Nantes have confirmed the permanent transfer of Super Eagles forward, Moses Simon from Levante of Spain after the player agreed a four-year deal that will see him remain with the French club until 2024. The French club announced this on its website yesterday that Simonâ€™s new deal takes effect from July 1 to 2024 after joining the team on loan from Spanish side, Levante. The Eagles striker has been efficient throughout this season as the most prolific offensive player (9 goals and 8 assists, all competitions), and he quickly adapted to French football, causing a lot of damage in the opposing defenses. Fast, punchy and technical, he quickly proved to be to his advantage in the left lane of the yellow and green attack but also as a center-forward. Stirring and very skillful in front of the goal, it turned out to be a real offensive solution for Christian Gourcuff. He is also comfortable with the right foot as the left foot, having played 30 matches this season under the Nantes colour and this made the fans to vote for him as Nantes Player of the season while his goal was awarded the strike of the season.
