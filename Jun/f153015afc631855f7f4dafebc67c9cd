 Badagry Local Government Area (LGA) Chairman, Olusegun Onilude, has advised farmers to be productive to prevent a shortage of food supply during and after the Coronavirus pandemic. He gave the advice during the distribution of farm implements to 100 farmers and food packages to the aged. Onilude said farmers’ empowerment became necessary to boost food production and ameliorate the effect of the lockdown on the people. “To maintain an all-round food supply at affordable prices to our people during and after COVID-19 pandemic, our administration has deemed it fit to give out incentives to farmers. We believe this will increase agricultural food supply in the local government,” he added. Onilude said that two weeks ago, the council distributed deep freezers, food stimulus packages and financially supported traders across the local government through the Department of Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation (WAPA).
