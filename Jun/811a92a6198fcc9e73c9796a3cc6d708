Following confirmations from within and outside the North-Central state that the COVID-19 index case in Kogi State was not in any way controversial, Governor Yahaya Bello, is gradually beating a very humble retreat and changing his approach to the fight against the pandemic virus without his usual media fanfare. The governor, who up until last weekend accused the NCDC of trying to force fictitious patients on the state, while insisting that his darling state is still uninfected by the ravaging virus, is now suddenly aligning with the centreâ€™s earlier claims which he publicly despised. It was gathered that the governor, during the week, at meetings he held with stakeholders, openly accepted the fact that there is need for the state to do more in its push against the virus now that it has found its way into the state. The fact that the index case is a prominent religious leader is not making things easy for Bello as he is having to retract some things he said when news first broke that the state had recorded two cases. But, like the smart politician he is, the governor is cleverly re-ordering his ways and surprisingly talking less.
