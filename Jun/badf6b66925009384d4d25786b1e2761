The funeral of former Oyo Governor, Sen. Abiola Ajimobi, has been postponed. His spokesman, Bolaji Tunji, told reporters in his Oluyole, Ibadan residence on Friday morning the family would soon make an announcement of the burial programme. Tunji said: “The funeral arrangements will be announced soon by the family but it will be observed privately so as to be in accordance with the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) guidelines.” He appealed to sympathisers, who have been thronging his residence, to continue following NCDC guidelines by washing their hands, using face masks and keeping social distancing, among others. Ajimobi died in a private hospital in Lagos on Thursday at 70.
