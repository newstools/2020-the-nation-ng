DESPITE the effect of the deadly COVID-19 on the entertainment scene, Akachukwu Emmanuel Uche aka Mmzy is still working hard to put finishing touches on his Extended Play (EP), which will be released later this year. With the release of his latest single, ‘Social Distance,’ the Abia State-born artiste has prepared the foundation for a body of work. His new single, according to him, is in response to the global Coronavirus pandemic. He said, “The song is already doing well across different platforms. So far, I have enjoyed huge followership from Nigerian music lovers.”
