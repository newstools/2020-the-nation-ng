Early morning travellers and motorists using the ever-busy Lagos-Ibadan Expressway had a horrendous time on Sunday following explosions caused by three oil tankers on Kara Bridge, Ogun State. Lagos State Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Commission, Mr Olusegun Ogungbemide, said a body burnt to its bones was recovered from the scene. But eyewitnesses put the number of deaths at four. One of the tankers laden with fuel was said to have lost control and rammed into an articulated truck,  resulting  in an  explosion around 12. 30am. Two other tankers, one loaded also with fuel and the other with gas, ran into the flame, causing another round of explosions. As of 3.30pm yesterday, gridlock  on the  highway had  yet to ease in spite of travel advisory issued 9.30am by the  FRSC. The Lagos FRSC sector boss also said  two injured persons were rushed to Gbagada General Hospital, Lagos at about 9am. He said, “It (accident) resulted from loss of control. One of the tankers that rammed  into other vehicles either had brake failure or got distracted. So far, we have been able to move two casualties to General Hospital Gbagada. One was burnt beyond recognition. “The accident involved three tankers and one truck. Two of the tankers were carrying petrol, another carrying gas and an articulated truck.” Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) Director-General,  Dr. Femi Oke-Osanyintolu, said the identities of the victims could  only be ascertained  through  DNA, since only their bones were seen. He  said: “We cannot even know for now  the number of people who died. You can see that it is only human bones we have seen so far. It will take pathology examination to ascertain the number of persons and identify them.”
