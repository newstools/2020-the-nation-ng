 The Director General of Voice of Nigeria and a chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) Mr. Osita Okechukwu has described the Court of Appeal judgement upholding the suspension of the national chairman of the party, Comrade Adams Oshiomole as a vindication of his position. Reacting to the appellate court order, Okechukwu in a statement titled “Is a Daniel come to judgement?” in Abuja on Tuesday night. According to the VON boss, ” It is good riddance to bad rubbish. He was playing God. One is vindicated, as I had maintained that Comrade Adams was no more a valid chairman of our great party. “That out of narcissism he glossed over his valid suspension by his ward executive and with culture of impunity failed to adhere to the provisions of APC Constitution. A man who lost his ward, LGA and State Exco has no reason to remain chairman.  “The good thing is that his suspension will afford a golden opportunity for the leadership of our party to overhaul and reposition our great party along the core progressive tenets, as we enshrined during merger in our constitution. “Lets be frank, and do a careful review of Adams stewardship and take our party as a company in stock market. As MD of APC Plc and taking states controlled in 2019 as stocks, did Adams pass or fail? He failed woefully,” Okechukwu maintained.
