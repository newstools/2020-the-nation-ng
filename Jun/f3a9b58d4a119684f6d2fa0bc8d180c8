An Osun State High Court, Osogbo, presided over by Justice Kudirat Akano has discharged one Gideon Aycent for the offence of conspiracy and armed robbery. Aycent was charged with armed robbety on  December 28, 2015 and prosecution counsel told the court that Aycent was a logger who had cut a log of wood which some armed robbers used in blocking the road for robbery along Iwo-Ikire Road. Aycent who did not have any legal representation for his defence for the first three years of his trial pleaded not guilty to the charge. A lawyer Mr Odunayo Henry took over his brief and argued that the evidence given by the prosecution counsel against Aycent was worthless and insufficient to secure his conviction. The presiding judge, Justice Akano, in her judgement agreed, stating that the prosecution’s case was predicated on mere suspicion. She discharged and acquitted Gideon Aycent.
