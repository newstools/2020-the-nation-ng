Naby Keita could get his wish to leave Liverpool with Jurgen Klopp reportedly keen on a move for Wolves midfielder Ruben Neves. Keita has not lost a single Premier League game since he arrived on Merseyside for £48m from RB Leipzig, but is yet to truly establish himself as a first-team regular. The Guinean midfielder has only appeared in 18 matches in all competitions this season, providing two goals and an assist, failing to hit the heights of his days at Germany. He has come under microscope this season, despite Liverpool‘s amazing campaign, with Jamie Carragher commenting in February that Keita’s statistics show “a top player”, but “I don’t feel like I see that with my eyes”.
