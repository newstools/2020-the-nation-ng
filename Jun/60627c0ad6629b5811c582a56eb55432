Edo Governor Godwin Obaseki failed to appear before the screening committe for the Governorship primary slated for June 22 on Wednesday in Abuja. Four of the six aspirants however participated in the exercise. The committee verfied the credentials of Hon. Osaro Obazee, Engr. Chris Ogiemwonyi, Dr. Pius Odubu and Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu. Obazee, Ogiemwonyi, Odubu and Iyamu took turn to appear before the panelists between 2pm to 6pm. The verification was done behind closed doors with reporters barred from attending the screening session. Obaseki, who is seeking for re-election, showed up on the first day of the screening exercise at the National Secretariat of the party in Abuja, the venue of the verification at about 1:10pm. He however hurriedly left five minutes after with a pledge to return for the exercise. The chair of the committee, Prof. Jonathan Ayuba, told newsmen his committee was not a judical panel of inquiry but assigned to carry out verification of credentials submitted by all the aspirants. Efforts by newsmen to get comments of the aspirants failed as none of them was willing to speakÂ  ready to speak. As at the time of filing the report, committee members, journalists and supporters of Governor Obaseki, decked in a white T-shirt with inscription of his picture and a fez-cap were seen loitering around the party secretariat for his return. The committee is expected to attend to the duo of Obaseki and Hon. Matthew Aigbuhuenze Iduoriyekemwen on Thursday before rounding off its assignment.
