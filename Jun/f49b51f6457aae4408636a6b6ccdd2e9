As part of efforts geared towards revitalising the nation’s dwindling mining sector, and boosting food security, the Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA) has consolidated its collaboration with Australian government on mining and agricultural sectors respectively. The National President of NACCIMA, Hajiya Saratu Iya-Aliyu disclosed this during a courtesy visit to the Australian High Commissioner, Ms. Claire Ireland at the Australian High Commission office in Abuja, over the weekend. She pointed out that increasing collaboration between the Australian private dector and the Nigeria private sector, as well as between the Chambers are important areas of her administration’s agenda. She commended the contributions of the Australian High Commission towards the success of NACCIMA Mining Road Show in August 2018, adding that the roadshow showcased potentials of the Nigeria’s mining sector and also exposed Nigerian miners to Australian mining investors. The NACCIMA national President assured the Australian High Commissioner that contacts which were made during the Melbone and Perth Mining roadshows have started yielding results for NACCIMA members. While assuring the Australian High Commissioner of NACCIMA’s commitment for deeper engagement with the Australian private sector in the area of mining and agriculture, Iya-Aliyu noted that the Director General of NACCIMA, Ambassador Ayoola Olukanni, who was a former High Commissioner of Nigeria to Australia, has been an active participant in the quest for NACCIMA to establish contact with the Australian private sector operators. In his address, Engr. Auwal Ibrahim Bununu, who represented the Miners Association of Nigeria, stressed the need for collaboration to develop the services in the mining sector and also development of business clusters to offer such services in the entire solid mineral value chain.
