 The Federal Government is considering increasing the number of electricity distribution companies (Discos) in order to improve electricity supply. Speaking during an inspection visit to the Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) yesterday in Abuja, Minister of State for Power, Mr.  Goddy  Jedy  Agba said government is not thinking of dismantling distribution companies (Discos) because of poor performance but rather considering adding to them to make them better. He said government is seeking ways to improve the operations of the Discos, noting that his visit to AEDC was part of engagement process to understand the operations and challenges of the Discos. Agba expressed satisfaction with the performance of AEDC, which has metered about 65 per cent of its customers, urging other energy distributors to emulate AEDC performance.  Managing Director, Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC), Mr. Ernest Mupwaya, said the firm tabled the problem of Customs Duty on meters in order to meet its customers’ demand and it received a favourable response. “One of the issues we brought to the minister’s notice is that issue of Customs Duty for meters so that we can meet our customers. I am glad to inform you that the government is waiting now to resolve this issue so that meters can be available,” Mupwaya said. He said the company has the capacity of installing 3,000 meters daily but it is constrained because thousands of meters are stagnant at the ports because of import duty. According to him, the government is working actively to resolve the issue in the bid to support the firm’s operation. He said the AEDC management also brought the issue of Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) payments of debts to the minister.
