Ojezua, who is a loyalist of Governor Godwin Obaseki, said he did not recognise Hon. Hillary  Eta who inaugurated the Uzodinma committee and that  he “had reservations with the entire process because the NWC did not first obtained the approval of the National Executive Committee as required by the Constitution of the party. “In the light of the above, we have no option but to reject the Hope Uzodinma-led Committee,” he said.
