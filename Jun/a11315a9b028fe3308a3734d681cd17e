 Lazarus Chakwera has been sworn in as Malawian President after winning an electoral rerun in the East African country. “Time has come for us to wake up and to make our dreams come true,” Mr Chakwera Sunday Sadiq in his victory speech.  He defeated incumbent Peter Mutharika with 58.57% of the vote in Tuesday’s poll. In February, Malawi’s constitutional court annulled Mr Mutharika’s victory in the May 2019 election, citing vote tampering.
