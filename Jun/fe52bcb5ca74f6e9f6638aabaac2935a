The Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) has declared its support for the Infectious Diseases Bill, saying that it will better equip the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to carry out its statutory responsibilities of infectious disease prevention and control across the country. It, however, said there is an urgent need to amend some provisions in the Bill in order to get widespread acceptance and buy-in of all the stakeholders involved. The NMA said since healthcare workers are on the frontline in the fight against dreadful and infectious diseases, just like the current COVID-19 pandemic, they should be adequately provided with personal protective equipment (PPEs) in order to significantly reduce their risk of exposure. Also, the PPEs should be part of the supplementary budget for the year in view. The President of the NMA, Prof. Innocent Ujah, made this known during the asociation’s presentation at the public hearing of the Infectious Diseases Bill at the National Assembly. Represented by the Secretary-General of the NMA, Dr. Philips Ekpe, in Abuja, he said: “We support the Infectious Diseases Bill but with some amendments. “Adequate personal protective equipment (PPEs) must be given to healthcare workers in the public and private sector. It should be included in the Bill such that the government will know that it is actually illegal not to supply adequate PPEs to healthcare workers because they can be infected and in turn infect many other patients. “They should include the funding of the PPEs in the supplementary budget for that period. Right now, we are using donations from well-meaning individuals, organisations and countries. “What would we have done if such donations did not come in? “There should also be special incentives such as life insurance, hazard allowance and compensation for injuries for the healthcare workers. “Also, vaccination and quarantine should not be by force, because it infringes on the fundamental human rights of the citizens.”
