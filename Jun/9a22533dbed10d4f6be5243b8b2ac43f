The Court of Appeal sitting in Calabar has dismissed the appeal filed by Stephen Anona who was sentenced to death by hanging for murder. Anona, a native of Anambra State, murdered an Uyo-based barber, Daniel Solomon Bassey in 2015 and was sentenced to death by hanging in 2019 by an Akwa Ibom High Court. The 37-year old Anona had approached the appellate court to stop the execution of the judgment of the Akwa Ibom High Court which in 2019, sentenced him to death by hanging. In a unanimous decision,Â  the appellate court upheld the judgment of Justice Ifiok Ukana and dismissed the appeal. Anona is heading to the Supreme Court to challenge the decision of the Appeal Court.
