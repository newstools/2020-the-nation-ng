Health Programmes Officer of DOEM, Catherine Olukotun, said the event was aimed at sensitising the beneficiaries on the prevention, treatment and management of vitamin deficiencies, process of dispensing de-worming drugs and multivitamins. She said: “We had to come with measures to alleviate the healthcare challenges faced by our children especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. This measure is aimed at supporting this health deficit by executing this de-worming and vitamins supplements which would combat with intestinal worms and boost the immunity of the children against and other diseases”. Christ the Light of Hope, Akute-Ogun State, Out of School Children Shelter Oshodi, Lagos and the Magnificent Therapy Home for Children, Yaba are the homes for vulnerable children where the activities were held.
