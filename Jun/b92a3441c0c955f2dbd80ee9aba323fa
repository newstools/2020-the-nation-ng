Quadri also had a new teammate at TTC as Hong Kong’s Lam Siu Hang will also be dornign the colour of TTC. The central German-based team will be relying on Quadri to spearhead the squad which also has German international Ruwen Filus and German youth international Fan Bo Meng. Meanwhile, Quadri has resumed training with Sporting in Portugal after three months inactivity due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Nigerian who has guided the Lisbon-based team to the semi-final stage of the ETTU Cup is expected to quit Portugal in September to move to Germany. Quadri, who is yet to pick his ticket to Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, told NationSport yesterday that he started training early this week and he hopes to keep in shape ahead of the resumption of the Olympic Qualifiers which may resume later this year.
