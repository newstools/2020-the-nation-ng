Femi Otedola’s household is presently in a merry mood as the billionaire’s heir, Fewa, turned 20 earlier in the week. While celebrating Fewa, his sister, DJ Cuppy, shared: “Happy birthday Fewa. My brother turns 20 today. He has autism and there’s definitely no shame on the spectrum. He is my God-given gift. I love you so much.” According to Temi Otedola, who is a fashion enthusiast, Fewa is her greatest joy. She wrote: “In the midst of the socially turbulent time, I was lucky enough to celebrate one of my greatest joys of life yesterday. Happy birthday to the best brother I could have ever wished for. You will be my baby forever. I love you.” Otedola’s first born and a singer, Tolani, said his brother reminded her that there could be much love and light in the world despite darkness. Her words: “Happy birthday to my brother whose day was yesterday. There’s been so much darkness in the world lately but you are my constant reminder that there can be much love and light too. I love you to infinity and beyond.” Fewa may not be active socially like his sisters, but it is pretty conspicuous that he is abundantly loved and cherished by the Otedola’s dynasty.
