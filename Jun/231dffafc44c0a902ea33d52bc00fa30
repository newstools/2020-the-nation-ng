 COOL FM presenter, Mannie Essien, recently took a swipe at Nigerian singers saying many of the current music acts encourage young men to disrespect women. The On-Air Personality made this statement during an Instagram interview where he expressed his disappointment at the lyrics of the love songs which litter the airwaves. “Somebody used a term to describe a woman saying ‘I will chop you finish’, what is chop you finish? When a boy listens to that song and sees a woman he would think he can chop the woman finish,”, Mannie began during the interview. He further expressed that after analysing some love songs, he found them to be demeaning and very suggestive. “I sat down one day and I analysed a number of love songs that have been released in this country, is love the only thing to sing about? And the love songs are very suggestive and demeaning. When you hear a song like that how do you want a guy to have respect for a woman when all the songs he listens to describe women as objects you can pound and chew. And if you don’t like me I have somebody else who will like me if you like pack and go. We have songs like that that are not encouraging boys to respect women”, Mannie noted. Mannie further said that artists turn deaf ears to situations happening around unlike in the past where musicians sing about current issues. “When we were growing up and there’s something happening musicians will sing about it and the situation will calm down. Now everybody is shouting black lives matter but who has sang a song about it?”. Mannie, a radio presenter, voice-over artist, singer, and compere, is the co-host of the Good Morning Nigeria Show on Cool FM, in Lagos.
