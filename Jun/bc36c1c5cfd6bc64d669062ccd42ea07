The Board of Trustees (BoT) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has called on party stakeholders to unite and rally round the party’s candidate in the September 19 Edo State governorship election, Mr Godwin Obaseki. In a congratulatory message to Obaseki, the chairman of the BoT, Senator Walid Jibrin, urged the various party organs to avoid pre election bickering that could cost the PDP the state. Obaseki, who on Friday defected to PDP from the All Progressives Congress (APC), won the ticket to fly the PDP flag in the election. The BoT chairman charged the various organs of the party to ensure peace in the Edo chapter before, during and after the election. Stating that winning Edo would brighten the chances of PDP winning the 2023 presidential election, Senator Jibrin thanked the National Working Committee and the PDP Governors Forum for ensuring a seamless defection of the governor to the PDP. BoT chair said, “On behalf of the BoT members, who serve as conscience of the party, I wish to sincerely congratulate first the entire people of Edo state, especially members of our party who encouraged Governor Obaseki to quickly move to PDP. “My biggest congratulations to Governor Obaseki who quickly understood the APC’s dirty game in their effort to mock and disgrace him. “I want to appeal to the leadership and all members of PDP to continue making our party strong and more united in our efforts to rule Nigeria come 2023. “Party members should shun actions that could affect the progress of rte party. The BoT is ever ready to work with party members, especially our NWC and the governors. “We congratulate all the South South governors for producing all PDP governors from their zone and we appeal to other governors to do same. “I want to assure the party and all members that the BoT is one and united and is ever ready to carry out its responsibilities as the conscience of the party”.
