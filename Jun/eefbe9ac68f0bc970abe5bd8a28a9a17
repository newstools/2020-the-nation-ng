 Mr. Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede and the Private Sector Health Alliance of Nigeria (PSHAN) have unveiled a new initiative geared towards significantly improving the healthcare at the grassroots. The innovative strategy, in furtherance of a vision from an earlier stakeholders’ roundtable, entails delivering one Primary Healthcare Centre (PHC) in each of Nigeria’s 774 Local Government Areas (LGAs) at global standards. Under this private sector driven initiative, universal health access will be provided for low-income citizens residing in rural and urban areas through the Adopt-a-Health Facility Programme (ADHFP). Chief Executive Officer, Private Sector Health Alliance of Nigeria (PSHAN), Mr. Sonny Nwarisi said the ADHFP would be sponsored by a group of angel investors and other institutions, who will each take responsibility for one or more PHCs “They will build and operate the PHCs for the period of adoption under strict rules and guidelines. The ADHFP is a multi-impact initiative with several benefits including: saving lives, improvement in health outcomes, job creation, and gender empowerment,” Nwarisi stated. Aig-Imoukhuede and PSHAN recently initiated the ADHFP design phase which will be handled by Vesta Healthcare Partners, a global healthcare consultancy firm. This consultancy engagement is expected to deliver key programme components such as: legal and regulatory framework, private-public partnership (PPP) framework, PHC facility and management standards, financing arrangements, governance arrangements, supply chain management, and technology and systems. The design phase will involve active participation of notable development-focused organisations including: Global Citizen, ABCHealth, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, World Bank, International Finance Corporation (IFC), MTN Nigeria Plc, Dangote Group, Zenith Bank, Access Bank, Stanbic-IBTC Bank, PwC, Cisco, Ford Foundation, Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) and Flying Doctors Nigeria.
