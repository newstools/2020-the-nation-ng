 The Ondo All Progressive Congress (APC) has asked the deputy governor of the state, Hon. Alfred Agboola Ajayi, to resign his position following his defection to the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). The party in a release by the publicity secretary, Alex Kalejaye, said the APC received his Ajayi’s decision to defect to the PDP with mixed feelings. The statement reads in parts “We wished Hon. Ajayi had not taken this decision, after series of efforts and attempts by royal fathers and party leaders, from within and outside the State to forestall this migration” The party also expressed displeasure with the deputy governor, for saying that he would remain the deputy governor, “as long as his people have not asked him to quit.” The statement added, “This statement is vexatious. It is imperative to remind Hon. Ajayi that he ran on an APC ticket given to Arakunrin Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, SAN, and both were sponsored by the party. Now that he chooses to defect, the party advises Agboola to tow the path of wisdom, and resign honourably as the Deputy Governor of Ondo State. “Ondo State APC wishes him and his followers a safe trip to the People’s Democratic Party, PDP. We will, however, be willing to reabsorb them whenever they opt to retrace their steps.”
