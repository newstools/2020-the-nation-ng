 Liverpool moved within one game of the Premier League title after returning to their irrepressible best to beat Crystal Palace 4-0. A goalless draw against Everton on Sunday had raised questions about Jurgen Klopp’s side following the return of the Premier League earlier this month. What did you miss? The latest from Europe’s top leagues But the Liverpool manager made four changes to the side that struggled in the Merseyside derby, restoring Mohamed Salah, Andrew Robertson and Georginio Wijnaldum to the starting line-up in the process and he wasn’t made to wait long for any doubts to be dismissed.  Trent Alexander-Arnold’s stunning 23rd minute free kick beat the visitors’ defensive wall and goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey before nestling in the top corner to give Liverpool a deserved lead. Salah doubled the hosts’ advantage in the 44th minute, latching onto Fabinho’s lofted through-ball before beating Palace full-back Patrick van Aanholt to score past Hennessey from close range. Fabinho added a third on 55 minutes with a long-range rocket of a strike from around 30 yards out that left Hennessey no chance. Salah turned provider from Liverpool’s defensive half for the fourth goal after 69 minutes, an incisive first-time through-ball playing in Sadio Mane to bend a shot into the corner of the net. Second-placed Manchester City play on Thursday against Chelsea and should they fail to win Liverpool will be crowned champions of the Premier League.
