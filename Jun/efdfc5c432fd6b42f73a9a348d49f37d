Manchester City are lining up a move for Burnley winger Dwight McNeil if Leroy Sane does make his expected exit from the Etihad. Germany international Sane, who made his first league appearance in an injury plagued campaign last week, has rejected numerous offers to extend his contract at City past its current expiration at the end of next season. Pep Guardiola is therefore likely to cash in on the 24-year-old when the transfer window reopens, with Bayern Munich heavily linked with a £50million swoop. City are considering whether they need to replace Sane, but according to ESPN, Burnley ace McNeil is on their radar. The 20-year-old has become one of the most exciting talents in the county following his debut in 2018, with five goals in 59 senior appearances. Guardiola has vowed not to go crazy in the market to succeed Sane, with plenty of options already employed by the club. “Firstly, Leroy is our player,” said Guardiola. “I don’t know if he will leave in the summer or at the end of his contract. “We have enough good players up front. Gabriel can play on the left, Foden can play on the left. We have Raheem. “Most of them are in good condition, like Phil, Riyad, Gabriel and Raheem. Players like that can play quite regularly for a long time. They are so stable in terms of injuries. “I think we have other priorities, maybe. I don’t know if after the Coronavirus, whether the financial situation for the club will change. “We will see at the end of this season.” Redknapp said: “It was a quality goal. Dwight McNeil is such a good player, lovely left foot, doesn’t stop running. I really like him. “Every time I watch him he gets better and better, he’s got real quality and certainly a player that the top six to eight clubs will be looking at, and that’s no disrespect to Burnley because I don’t like saying that sometimes, but he is that good. “He’s got great energy from midfield.” (www.newsnow.co.uk)
