President Muhammadu Buhari has forwarded the name of the Acting President of the Court of Appeal, Justice Monica Dongban-Mensem, to the Senate for substantive confirmation. The decision of the President was contained in a statement issued by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu. “President Muhammadu Buhari, in-line with his constitutional responsibility has sent the nomination of Her Lordship, Justice Monica Dongban-Mensem, Acting President, Court of Appeal to the Senate for confirmation as President, Court of Appeal. “Justice Dongban-Mensem is a serving Justice of the Court of Appeal and was recommended, as is the practice, by the National Judicial Council for the nomination by the President,” the statement said. It would be recalled, however, that the appointment and the question of confirmation of Justice Dongban-Mensem had recently stirred public interest, with many insinuating that the President was foot-dragging on her effective confirmation for ethnic or religious reasons. One of those who took the President on over the development was former military administration of Kaduna State, Col. Abubakar Dangiwa Umar, who also accused him of giving lopsided appointments. The Presidency had reacted to insinuations negatively depicting the President’s intensions with regards to appointments, claiming that President Buhari’s appointments had followed the dictates of the Constitution.
