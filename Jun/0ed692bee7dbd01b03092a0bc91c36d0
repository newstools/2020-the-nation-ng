African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank)   shareholders  have voted and re-appointed Prof. Benedict Oramah as President of the Pan-African multilateral financial institution for a second five-year term. The decision was announced in Cairo following Afreximbank’s 27th Annual General Meeting (AGM) of shareholders, which was held by circulation of resolutions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In an acceptance statement released shortly thereafter, President Oramah told shareholders that the bank’s ultimate goal under his second term would be the realisation of Africa’s strategic ambition to create an integrated market. “We want an Africa where the foundations of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) are laid expeditiously so that the 84,000 kilometres of borders that have divided us for ages can begin to come down,” said Oramah. He added that AfCFTA would “drive the industrialisation of Africa, support the emergence of regional value chains, turn Africa’s creative and cultural assets into engines of growth, grow jobs for the continent’s youth, convey respect to Africans wherever they may be and better prepare the continent to compete more effectively in the global markets.”
