 Fresh move to reconcile Players’ Union factions has taken off as leaders of National Association of Nigerian Footballers (NANF), and Association of Professional Footballers of Nigeria (APFON) converge in Lagos to seek an end to the lingering problem. Initiated by a former footballer turned politician, the leadership of NANF led by Clement Temile and Kelvin Etemike informed of their readiness to toe the line of peace for the betterment of Nigerian footballers. The grassroots politician and football promoter had met with APFON president Tijani Babangida and other leaders on the need to sheath their swords and have a unified union that would fight for players’ welfare. For close to two decades, the groups have been mired in controversy which has affected the welfare and well being of Nigerian footballers.  Welcoming the development, Lagos state AFCON chairman, Tajudeen Disu said it is important that leaders of both factions meet and fashion a way to unify themselves. “What we need is to have a single Player Union to push the course of Nigerian players. Anything short that will be counterproductive.” Reliable source further revealed that plans to bring the factions together are nearing conclusion and football stakeholders and ex-internationals such as Christian Chukwu, Segun Odegbami, Peter Rufai, and are expected to be present at the occasion. “We are missing a lot from International Federation of Professional Footballers   (FIFPro) and other quarters which we would make a difference in the life of ex-players and those still playing if we are together,” Disu added.
