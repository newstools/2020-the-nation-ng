 Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has  yet underlined the addition of Nigerian striker Odion Ighalo  to his side  ahead of today’s Premier League action against Tottenham Hotspur. Ighalo’s six  loan deal was further extended in the wake of the EPL shut down as a result of COVID-19 lockdown since March. But speaking yesterday during the presser to preview Manchester United’s return to action against Tottenham Hotspur, Solskjaer admitted that Ighalo has brought so much to the side since his deadline loan deal in January from Chinese Super League side Shanghai Shenhua. “We’re delighted Odion is staying with us,” remarked the Norwegian. “We had a good conversation with his club and Odion’s made a great impact when he came, so that’s very pleasing.”  Since his arrival, the Manchester United’s number 25 has  scored four times in eight games but Solskjaer reckoned the 2019 AFCON top scorer  has given the Red Devils so much more. He said: “He gives us another option up front, he is a goal scorer and what he does in and around the dressing room as well is great. “I hope he’s going to continue and finish off what he has started.” In a related development, Manchester United legend Peter Schmeichel has hailed Ighalo, believing the Nigeria international deserved his loan extension. “I think he’s been one of the most positive surprises ever,” he said. “First of all his personality around the club, he’s been a revelation around the club. Everybody has tagged on and liked him straight away. “When you have that kind of personality, it changes the whole team. Someone who brings a laugh into the dressing room, rather than coming in grumpy or not saying anything. “It changes the dynamics. And what he’s done on the pitch that really has surprised me.”
