Anxiety has gripped the camps of Edo All Progressives Congress (APC) aspirants as they await outcome of the screening committee of the party. The aspirants screened by the committee are: Governor Godwin Obaseki, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, Dr. Pius Odubu, Engr. Chris Ogiemwonyi, Hon. Osaro Obazee and Hon. Matthew Iduoroyekemwen. By the schedule of activities by APC National Organising Secretary, Barrister Emma Ibediro, aspirants seeking the party’s ticket were to be screened on Wednesday and Thursday while aggrieved aspirants have up till Friday to appeal. Supporters of the aspirants and journalists waited on Thursday for report of the screening committee to no avail. But as at the time of filling this report, the Prof. Jonathan Ayuba-led committee was still sitting at the Conference room of the National Secretariat, heightening tension in the camps of the aspirants. Agents and supporters of some of the aspirants were seen hanging around the party secretariat in anticipation of the findings and recommendation of the screening committee. A supporter one of the aspirants, who spoke in confidence to our reporter, decried the delay in the release of the finding of the screening committee. “How can the screening committee keep everyone in suspense, knowing fully well that any candidate that is disqualified has only Friday to appeal? This delay may ignite legal action against the good intention behind the exercise,” the supporter complained. However it was realiably learnt that the committee may have recommended the disqualification of two of the aspirants over alleged anti-party activities. The appeal committee is expected to sit on Friday at the party’s secretariat.
