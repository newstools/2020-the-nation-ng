 THE Ministry of Youth and Sports Development  has  reportedly supported ailing coach Kadiri Ikhana with a sum of money to augment his medical bill. It could be recalled that Ikhana  was in  Abuja some months ago for medical treatment which included surgery and had solicited for financial assistance. Speaking  on the gesture, the Minister Sunday Dare  said: “Coach Kadiri Ikhana is an ex-international of note, he served the country, he was part of the historic team in 1980 and a one-time Super Falcons coach. He brought smiles to the faces of football loving Nigerians on the  when he became the first Nigerian coach to win the CAF Champions League trophy. “I heard his plea for assistance and I sent one of my aides to him while he was in the hospital to ascertain the level of assistance required by the coach. What better way to show support than to foot part of his medical bills? That’s what we have done. “Like I have always maintained, the welfare of athletes, ex-internationals and that of those who still represent us remains our priority and we will continue to be on the lookout to assist in any way we can. We wish Coach Kadiri Ikhana a quick recovery,” he noted.
