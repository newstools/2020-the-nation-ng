 THE Federal Government has declared Friday, June 12, as public holiday to mark this year’s Democracy Day celebration. Interior Minister Ogbeni Rauf Adesoji Aregbesola, who announced this on Monday in Abuja on behalf of the Federal Government, congratulated all Nigerians for the entrenchment of democratic rule in the country. The minister hailed the heroes of democracy for their dogged determination and sacrifice which eventually birthed government of the people by the people, for the people in Nigeria. A statement by the Permanent Secretary in the ministry, Georgina Ehuriah, quoted Aregbesola as urging Nigerians to continue to cherish the selfless efforts made to attain democracy. He urged Nigerians to collaborate with President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration to realise democratic ideals which the nation’s patriots fought for, even at the risk of their lives.
