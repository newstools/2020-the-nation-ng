Book Reviewer: Asamani Frederica Queen Amarachi Desert Breed; as the name suggests unveils a life of pain, confusion, torture, uncertainty, strife and an undying stance to outlive the woes attached to surviving in the wild. The masterful writer, Obinna Oke, through his portrayal of the protagonist, Uche Ojemba, paints a gripping gory picture of how some orphaned children strive to survive in a cold world of hate, harsh treatments, betrayal, rejection and near-deaths in order to live a life of normalcy. The character of Mama and her children: Amaka, Nweke and Angela illustrate the lack height of hate as evident in some polygamous homes. Using rapt and easy-to-understand diction, the writer makes the language of the text reader-friendly and through complex plot structures and diverse settings, he unmasks the paradoxical truth that, one can still breathe even in the height of misfortune and the continuous race towards survival. Finally, as the end shows, in every tough journey, ‘the resilient’ emerge with resounding turns of victory. Desert Breed is an intrigue and a must read as every new scene reopens to a breathtaking and pulse raising journey, showcasing the inhumane treatments meted out to these individuals; with the quest to educate readers, making life. The writer with his skill as a craft master, weaves all these together with his aim geared towards achieving his themes. Obinna Oke is surely a writer that I look forward to reading more. His style of writing offers a unique pattern of hunger and thirst for more, with a deep satisfaction that comes only from born master story tellers like him. I have read Desert Breed twice and I know it won’t be long before I yield to the urge of reading it the third time. Grabbing a copy of this book will be doing one’s self a deserving favour.
