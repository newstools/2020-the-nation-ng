 NOLLYWOOD filmmaker Victor Okpala has threatened to sue actress and producer, Kemi Lala Akindoju over a rape accusation. Okpala, through his lawyers, Aghogho Akpojotor & Associates, made the threat a few days back. In his reaction to the rape allegation, Okpala threatened to slam Akindoju with an N100 million lawsuit for defamation of character and libel. The filmmaker also petitioned the Assistant Inspector-General of Police, Zone 2, Onikan, Lagos, demanding for Akindoju to physically produce the faceless actress to substantiate her claims as well as the Police to launch a full-scale independent investigation into the allegation leveled against him. In a letter to the AIG, and signed by Barrister Aghogho Akpojotor, Okpala urged the police to charge the matter to court after the conclusion of its investigation. On June 5, Lala Akindoju claimed via her Instagram page that Okpala, the Chief Executive Officer of Dope 7 Media, raped and sexually harassed Oshevire Divine and Sharon Osiyerimo Ohunene Jatto. The claim was made in a video format with written printing, narrating how the said incident happened. Okpala’s lawyers urged the police to commence investigation saying, “We implore you to accordingly use your good office to investigate on the complaints and this matter be accordingly charged to court in the interest of justice, equity, and good conscience, as the person, marriage, reputation and good standing of our client is been maligned.”
