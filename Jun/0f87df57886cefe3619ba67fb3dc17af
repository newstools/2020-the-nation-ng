The leadership of Computer Village, Ikeja,  on Monday described as lies from the pit of hell, allegation purporting that the Iyaloja-General of Lagos State, Mrs Folashade Tinubu-Ojo, asked it to mobilise N5million daily from the market for her. It said rather than asking for money, the Iyaloja-General had been spending her money to provide for the needs of the ICT market. Speaking with reporters in Ikeja, the Iyaloja Mrs Abisola Isokpehi and Babaloja Mr Adeniyi Olasoji of Computer Village, said the media campaign was orchestrated by a handful of disgruntled elements within the market that have vowed to ensure the board constituted and inaugurated by the state government never succeeds. Mrs Isokpehi, who said the masterminds of the atrocious smear campaign had since gone to apologise to Mrs Tinubu-Ojo, said nobody asked for N1000 daily from the shop owners, adding that the cash was a monthly contribution meant for the clean up of the market, payment of salaries of day and night security guards and others, such as replacement of batteries and other accessories of the solar- powered street light. She said Mrs Tinubu-Ojo never asked the leadership for any cash, stressing that the peaceful administration of the market was paramount to her. The Iyaloja of Computer Village also dispelled the rumour that the market was closed because of breakdown of law and order. According to her, a certain group of individuals had vowed to frustrate the board in spite of genuine efforts made to reach out to them. She said it was the same group that have embarked on this campaign designed to smear the reputation of the Iyaloja-General and her illustrious family. Mrs Isokpehi said: “We are committed to working harmoniously with associations/tribes in the market to run an all-inclusive administration.’’
