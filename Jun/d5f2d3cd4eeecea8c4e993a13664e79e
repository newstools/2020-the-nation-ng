Minister of Mines and Steel Olamilekan Adegbite has said Nigeria can fall back on mines and steel as an alternative income generating sector following the COVID-19 crisis. He said the Federal Government has lured UK and other foreign investors with mineral potentials and incentives to Nigeria. According to him: “Investors in the United Kingdom (UK) and other advanced countries should consider investing in Nigeria’s mineral and mining sector, as it feature attractive incentives and potentials.” The Minister, who spoke during a webinar by the Nigerian Global Business Forum in association with the Nigerian British Business Forum, said the current administration has started to look into the challenges and neglect in the sector. He said it recognises mining as a strategic income stream in the face of dwindling oil revenue and looks forward to increasing its contribution to the national GDP by 3%. “President Muhammadu Buhari’s Administration met serious challenges in the mining sector occasioned by long neglect. It was apparent that we must re-enact the ‘Nigeria before oil’ policies when the sector contributed as much as 5.6% in 1980 to the national GDP,” he said. He noted the sector is an investment opportunity in Nigeria that creates jobs and increases revenues earnings. Titled Invest Nigeria (Opportunities, Guidelines, Incentive), the webinar witnessed the attendance of the CEO, Nigeria Export Promotion Council (NEPC), Olusegun Awolowo, who said the agency has devised the Nigeria Diaspora export programme (NDEX) to use Nigeria large diaspora to more effectively increase non-oil exports. CEO/Executive Secretary NEPC, Ms Yewande Sadiku, harped on investment opportunities profiling across Nigeria, standardised template and data base of investment opportunities. Moderator and Publisher, Fin Magazine, Mrs Yinka Fayomi, commended the government on the guidelines, opportunities and incentive made available for investors to enjoy a peaceful atmosphere in the country.
