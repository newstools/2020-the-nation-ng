An Ondo- based journalist, who was discharged from the Infectious Disease Hospital in Akure, has claimed he had malaria and not COVID-19. Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu on Monday said the journalist tested positive for COVID-19. Speaking after he was discharged, the 33-year-old journalist, who resides in Ore, Odigbo Local Government, urged the public to ignore reports that he tested positive for Coronavirus. He insisted he had malaria without having any symptoms of COVID-19 and had recovered three weeks ago before he was invited by contact tracing officials. The journalist said another test conducted at the IDH confirmed him negative, he was still held at the facility where he was given chloroquine and vitamin C. But Ondo Commissioner for Health, Dr. Wahab Adegbenro, dismissed the claims, saying there was nothing to gain by lying about anyoneâ€™s status. Adegbenro insisted that the first samples returned positive from the molecular testing centre in Ede, Osun. He urged the journalist to desist from spreading falsehood as it could hinder the fight against the virus. Meanwhile, nine persons have died from COVID-19 related illness in the state.
