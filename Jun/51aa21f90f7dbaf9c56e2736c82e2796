Three members of the Gombe State Executive Council, a Special Adviser to the Governor and five legislators in the State House of Assembly have tested postive for COVID-19. The nine persons were among 63 cases who tested positive for COVID-19, the Stateâ€™s Taskforce on COVID-19 said on Tuesday. The Chairman of the taskforce, Prof. Idris Mohammed, who made this known while updating journalists on COVID-19 said in the last four days, 609 samples had been taken and 63 had returned positive. He raised the alarm on community transmission of the disease even as he said the increase in positive cases may not be unconnected with the ongoing massive test, following the death of a Director in the government house. The chairman further said the taskforce would have community monitors to liaise with communities across the state to ensure proper contact tracing and testing.
