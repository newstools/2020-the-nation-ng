Police in Lagos on Sunday said they arrested 185 suspected cultists terrorising Ikorodu and environs. Spokesman Bala Elkana said eight locally-made pistols were recovered from the suspects within the last two weeks during raids of Ikorodu, Ipakodo, Igbogbo, Ibeshe, Shagamu Road, Agbowa and others. Elkana said the raids followed a directive from the Commissioner of Police Hakeem Odumosu to the Special Strike Force on social miscreants to tackle the menace of cultism in Ikorodu district. Elkana said the operatives launched an intelligence-driven operation that targeted top cult leaders and members especially those who engaged in supremacy tussles that took lives. “Operatives of the Special Strike Force were given clear instructions to reclaim and dominate the public spaces and ensure that no cult groups or gangs operate in any part of Lagos State. “The Strike Force has so far arrested 185 notorious cultists and recovered eight locally made pistols and other dangerous weapons from them. “Suspects arrested confessed to belong to Eiye, Aiye, KK, Buccaneers, Vikings confraternities, among others. One Gbadamosi Mohammed, 30, suspected to be among the cultists, who reportedly killed one Madariola Sunday at Ibeshe on May 21, was among the suspects arrested. “Also arrested are Onibudo Afeex, Habeeb Isa, Felix Igwoke, Taiwo Iyanu at Femi Taiwo Street, Ikorodu. They were arrested in an uncompleted building holding cult meeting. One Adeoye Daya, 25, a hit man of Aiye confraternity, was arrested at Ikorodu garage with one locally made short gun.”
