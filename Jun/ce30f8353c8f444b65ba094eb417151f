The President is unhappy with the current state of the security situation in the country. Disclosing this to State House Correspondents on Thursday, after a security briefing, the National Security Adviser (NSA), Maj. Gen. Babagana Monguno (Rtd.), said the President had charged managers of the nation’s security to redouble their efforts. According to Monguno, the President said, though the security chiefs had been doing their best, their best had not been good enough for the challenges facing the nation. He has therefore declared that excuses will no longer be tolerated, even as he said he expects everyone to live up to expectations. He also expressed displeasure over the lack of synergy amongst security forces and charged the various aspects of the security architecture to work together to solve the nation’s security challenges. He said the President charged the office of the NSA to meet with governors of the Northwest states and that of Niger State, for briefing and strategic organisation of a response to the Banditry problem in their domains.
