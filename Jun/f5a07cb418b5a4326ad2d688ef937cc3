Inter Milan are yet to agree loan extensions for Alexis Sanchez and Victor Moses despite their current deals almost being at an end. Sanchez joined the Italian giants from Manchester United last summer, while Chelsea full-back Moses was reunited with his old boss Antonio Conte in January. Inter want both players to remain in Italy to finish the delayed season, but they are yet to make a breakthrough in talks. Conte’s side, which are third in the table, still have 10 Serie A games to play as they attempt to chase down Juventus and Lazio. Sanchez and Moses are also eligible for Inter’s Europa League campaign, with Spanish side Getafe next up in the last 16 of the competition. However, Giuseppe Marotta has revealed that it is not yet certain that the Premier League duo will complete the season with Inter.
