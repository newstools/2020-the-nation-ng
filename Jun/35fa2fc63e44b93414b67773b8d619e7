Secretary to the Government of the Federation and Chairman of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 Boss Mustapha on Thursday said he would return Nigeria to lockdown if he had the powers to do so. Mustapha said that although a return to lockdown might not be popular, it was the right thing to do considering the attitude of some Nigerians to the virus. The PTF is expected to submit its assessment of the first three months of waging war against coronavirus pandemic to President Muhammadu Buhari next week. The Task Force had continued to lament the flagrant disregard for the protocols developed by the PTF to contain the spread of the virus. Speaking during the briefing of the task force on Thursday, the SGF lamented some persons are “already romancing with Covid -19” in the manner of Tom and Jerry. Latest figures from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control showed that Nigeria has 22, 020 confirmed cases of COVID -19 with 542 deaths from the deadly virus. Mustapha said: “You want to hear the truth? If it were within my powers this is the time to lockdown. Lockdown might not be a popular thing but this is the time to lockdown because I can see the attitude of Tom and Jerry, we are already romancing with Covid -19 and it is not good.” The SGF said Nigerians must continue to take responsibility to reduce community transmission of the virus. He urged Nigerians to take the virus serious and continue to observe the guidelines developed by the task force. Mustapha added: “I saw a real romance with Covid -19 today. Romance of people behaving as if the matter (virus) is over. It is a very serious issue and my appeal to Nigerians listening is that; let us take this thing (virus) serious. By now, with 500 plus fatalities you can’t be ignorant, you can’t say you don’t know of any body that has fallen victim either by way of name or pictures but today they are no more.”
