 Southwest National Vice Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP), Eddy Olafeso, has insisted that no aspirant was prepared to step down for Ondo Deputy Governor Agboola Ajayi. Olafeso was responding to comments by a National Working Committee member of the PDP that the Deputy Governor might the candidate of the party on the condition of serving only one term in office. He said Agboola was not yet a member of the PDP and has not collected nomination or expression of interest forms.  According to him: “I can confirm to you that as of today only six people have collected the PDP governorship form for the election. Erewa, Okunomo, Ayorinde, Jegede, Eddy and Oba Akingboye. “In tradition of PDP it is only the delegates who determine who become their governor. You can check the interview od our National Chairman of yesterday, and he has already established that while we encourage people to join us, due process is constantly followed whatever you want to become in the party. “The NWC has not taken any decision, people can participate but nobody is stepping down for anybody. The decision of who becomes governor is taken by the people.”
