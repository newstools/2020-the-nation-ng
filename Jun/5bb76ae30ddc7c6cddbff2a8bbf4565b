SIR: The latest Executive Order 10 of President Buhari granting financial autonomy to the judiciary and the legislature at both the federal and state levels appears not to be resonating with the Bar, the voice and alter ego, as it were, of the judiciary, and the Houses of Assembly of the states. While the muffled excitement in the various Houses of Assembly of the states is understandable, same being reduced to a mere appendage of the governor of the state, and has never really experienced freedom in the real sense of the word, but always timidly approach the performance of their legislative functions at the behest of the respective governors, however, the silence from the judiciary which has always prided itself as the bastion of the rule of law is beyond explanation. While it is understandable that the judiciary, by its ethical codes, cannot be heard outside of its adjudicatory role; however, the Nigerian Bar Association, NBA, which by the age-long tradition, is the alter ego and voice of the judiciary, is on a mute mode, choosing to preoccupy itself more with its forthcoming bar elections, and unwittingly foisting on the polity, a miniscule members of the Bar on narcissistic voyage to regale the rest of the public with their own interpretation of the “unconstitutionality of the said Executive Order as if the same constitution does not contemplate such autonomy for the judiciary ab initio. Pray, what really is the intendment of the drafter of Section 121 (3) of the extant constitution specifically charging the fund due to the judiciary to the Consolidated Revenue Account of the federation, and equally providing for the corporate so-called the “heads of courts” entitled to the receipt of payment of that fund, when same is read and understood alongside the interpretation of the community reading of PART 2 encapsulating Sections 4,5,6, of the extant Constitution? Why acknowledge the existence of the judiciary as distinct from the other two organs of government in the light of the much-hallowed doctrine of independence of the judiciary if the argument is that there is still a further need to amend the constitution to give effect to the financial autonomy of the judiciary? From my sophomore years in the university, lawyers and legal scholars alike have always agreed on the nagging issue of lack of judicial independence as one factor militating against justice delivery in Nigeria. To stretch it further, at the core of our agitations for restructuring of the polity is the quest for social justice in the distribution of wealth, resources and personal opportunities to the people. Independence of the judiciary, unbeknownst to many, is the missing link in the value chain of this quest as the judiciary will be strengthened and emboldened to be able to right the wrong of unjust social relations among the federating units, through aggressive judicial activism in the interpretation of the law in the light of social matrixes and facts when it operates from the pedestal of independence, nay, financial independence. Regrettably, the Bar, the voice and alter ego of the judiciary in this agitation has suddenly gone on silence mode, failing in this bounden duty to lend its voice and influence to this laudable step by the president to grant the judiciary the much-desired independence in a pragmatic manner it has come. It goes to show that the much-bandied agitations in the polity are all lip service and self-serving political gimmickry intended only to feather the nest of a few leading the agitations in some circumstances. The Nigerian Bar Association will do well to focus on the bigger picture of the pragmatic independence of the judiciary and all its concomitants that the Executive Order 10 guarantees by setting forth at dawn to articulate, synthesize and champion advocacy and opinions favourable to this new deal for the judiciary. This will invariably provide source materials from which the silent bench can draw in adjudication when the shylock Lords of the manor who seek to reap and rip us apart from our common patrimony would bare their fangs against the Executive Order in court. If only we can sit back for a moment to imagine the new day it would be for the state judiciary or state House of Assembly not to depend on the governor to provide the required facilities in the performance of their respective functions, we would have seen a clearer picture of a scenario of a real practice of checks and balances required for the elusive dividends of democracy being ushered into our political governance system.
