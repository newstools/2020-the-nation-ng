President, Muaythai Federation of Nigeria (MFN), Comrade Paul Egonu has called on the Minister of Youth and Sports development, Sunday Dare to strengthen the country’s anti-doping system while updating athletes from time to time. Speaking from Port Harcourt, Rivers state, he said Nigerian athletes need to be reminded of the dangers and adverse effects of taking banned drugs. Egonu’s advice is coming on the heel of recent provisional suspension of Nigeria-born athlete Ebelechukwu Agbapuonwu (now known as Salwa Eid Naser) for missed drug tests allegation leveled against her by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU). The Bahraini athlete, who raised eyebrows at the World Championships in 2019 by running the fastest 400m time since 1985, is facing a potential two-year ban over an alleged ‘whereabouts’ violation. Under the rules, three missed tests or filing failures in a rolling one-year span will trigger a charge – Naser admitted on Saturday that she missed three tests ahead of the worlds in Doha, prompting bemusement in the sport over why she was cleared to run, and it has now been confirmed that she went on to miss a fourth test in January of this year. Naser, 22, took almost a second off her personal best in beating Olympic champion Shaunae Miller-Uibo in 48.14sec – the third quickest time in history. Egonu said it is imperative for the Sports ministry to step up its anti-doping campaign and continually educate its athletes on rules of doping. “It is not every day you break a record and to be striped of it is painful. It is important athletes know doping rules, what to eat, drink and stay away from.” The curious case of Naser’s missed drug tests deepened last week when it emerged she was allowed to run at the world championships last year despite missing three tests beforehand and was provisionally suspended only after missing a fourth in January.
