Faithia Williams has raised the alarm over an Instagram page using her picture to defraud the people. Faithia wrote a disclaimer on her Instagram page distancing herself from anything that has to do with the said account. She wrote; “I have been informed of @gra_e657 using my image to scam people of their hard-earned money, let me state this clearly that I do not have anything with this account, scheme or anything that tells people to bring their money. Please beware of this account or any other account using my name or face for any illegal business. “Let me state this unequivocally, I know the country is hard and I know a lot of us are trying to survive but please we need to stop doing fraud, encouraging fraud and defending those who do fraud simply because they flash money or they have talent. Fraud is a fraud, it is illegal and it hurts other people. “Many have been sent to early graves because of some people’s fraudulent activities, it is bad when we use celebrity image or status to scam people. Please note that fraud has consequences and let us not encourage it”.
