The Nigeria Police has said it deployed personnel to the National Secretariat of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to ensure there was no breakdown of law and order as the two factions of the party remain at daggers drawn. According to a statement by the Force Public Relations Officer, DCP Frank Mba, the presence of its personnel at the secretariat was not to seal off the place but to prevent any untoward situation within and around the premises. “Personnel of the Nigeria Police Force have been deployed to the National Secretariat of the All Progressive Congress, located at Blantyre Crescent, Wuse II, Abuja. The deployment is a proactive move by the Force to maintain peace and ensure there is no breakdown of law and order at the Secretariat. “The presence of police personnel at the Secretariat is not to seal-up the Complex as has been reported in some quarters but rather to prevent any untoward situation within and around the APC National Secretariat. ” Members of the APC as well staff of the Secretariat are therefore at liberty to conduct their legitimate businesses, in and around the Secretariat as always,” the statement read.
