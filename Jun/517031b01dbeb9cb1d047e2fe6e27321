 Nigerian players have been locked out of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) COVID-19 relief fund following the dwindling fortune in global ranking. According to the President of the Nigeria Tennis Federation (NTF), Ifedayo Akindoju, the relief fund by ITF is meant for players in top 700 in the world and no Nigerian player in men and women is rated within this range. “I don’t think any Nigerian player will benefit from the fund because we don’t have any one of them in the range of those considered to benefit from the relief fund. However, as a national association, we are making efforts to appeal to the world body to support national associations in this trying period,” he said.  The ITF is in the process of finalising a range of additional measures to support stakeholders impacted by COVID-19, including a relief fund to help tour players ranked 501-700 not covered under other relief programmes. David Haggerty, ITF President, said: “We are doing everything within our power to ensure that the talented players climbing the ITF pathway receive the support they need and continue their development during these uncertain times. Many professionals and organizations in the tennis world have been significantly impacted by this hiatus in our sport due to COVID-19. “ However, the NTF boss said the federation would continue to support talented players in their quest to put Nigeria on the world map.
