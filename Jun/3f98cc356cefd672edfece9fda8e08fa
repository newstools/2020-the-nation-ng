A battle between two of the current struggling sides in the Bundesliga as Koln and Union Berlin both desperately seek to snap their winless runs. The hosts have failed to secure victory in any of their previous six league fixtures while the same can be said for Union’s last eight. Both were also held to draws last weekend. Union aren’t quite safe from relegation yet and there is a lot more riding on this game for them than Koln. Given Dusseldorf’s clash with Dortmund and Bremen’s meeting with Paderborn, they know that this is an opportunity to move seven points clear with nine left to play for.  Last weekend suggested that Union are better equipped for this game than Koln and if they can sort their finishing out, they will hit the net a couple of times en route to victory. Recent showings have failed to demonstrate that Koln justify their even money price; particularly against an opponent whose performances have picked up as time has progressed.
