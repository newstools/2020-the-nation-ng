 The Rivers State All Progressives Congress (APC) has said it would not be distracted by the comments of the state Governor, Nyesom Wike, on the disqualification of his counterpart in Edo State, Godwin Obaseki from contesting the party’s governorship primaries. The party in a statement signed by its Caretaker Chairman, Igo Aguma, told Wike that the National Chairman of APC, Adams Oshiomhole, would lead the party to victory in Edo noting that Wike’s recent outburst would not distract the party. Aguma, who said Oshiomhole was leading a revolution in the APC, highlighted some of the missteps by Obaseki that led to his loss of relevance in the APC. He said even if Obaseki eventually defects to the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) members of his new party would be wary of him. He said: “There is a revolution going on in the APC spearheaded by the National Chairman of the great Party, His Excellency Comrade Adams Oshiomhole. It is a known political philosophy that a collective effort cannot bring you to power and you turn around and abandon the system. “It is unfortunate that the crisis in Edo state has been allowed to fester to the extent that 14 legislators of same party that brought the governor to power have not resumed for over one year after they were elected by their constituencies because of the sole political interest of the Governor of Edo state. “This has denied the people of the respective constituencies’ representation in the government of Edo state. I am indeed confident that even the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) irrespective of the defection of the Edo state Governor will be wary of him. “As for the All Progressives Congress, we are confident that as the system that produced him, we will successfully produce another APC governor during the next governorship election come September 19, 2020.”
