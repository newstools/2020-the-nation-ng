Chairman House Representatives Committee on Aviation, Nnolim Nnaji has appealed to the Federal Government to immediately release the intervention fund it pledged to aviation agencies. The release of the funds, he said will ensure a smooth and gradual restoration of air transport services as announced by the Presidential Taskforce on COVID-19. Nnaji said the appeal became necessary because agencies were already finding it difficult to pay salaries due to the impact of the three months lockdown of the sector. According to him ,Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria, (FAAN) ,  Nigerian Airspace Management Agency, (NAMA)  and Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority, (NCAA)  rely  solely on aeronautical charges as their major source of internally generated revenue, (IGR) which had been eroded by the closure of airports. He also appealed to the Presidential Taskforce to support the sector with some items including  personal protective equipments, (PPE) and sanitizers. He said the  paucity of fund  has made the agencies unable to fulfill their obligations to their  workers especially in the payment of salaries. Such development,  he said has created tension in the sector and the workers were  threatening to embark on strike  few days to  the reopening of five airports for   local flights. He said : “As we speak, four industrial unions in the sector, the National Union of Air Transport Employees, (NUATE), the Air Transport Services Senior Staff Association of Nigeria, (ATSSSAN), Association of Nigerian Aviation Professionals, (ANAP) and the Amalgamated Unions of Public Corporations of Civil Service Technical and Recreational Services Employees, (AUPCCSTRSE) have issued a notice of warning strike over the issue of salary and we must resolve this otherwise the planned opening of the airports will not materialise.” He stated.
