The Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai (IBBUL) has got full accreditation from the National Universities Commission (NUC) for Mass Communication, Biology and Computer Science. In a letter addressed to the Vice-Chancellor and signed by the commission’s Director of Accreditation, Dr. Maryam Sali, the approval is the result of an accreditation exercise conducted late last year as part of its statutory mandate to accredit academic programmes in universities. The letter stated further that while Mass Communication is in the Social Science, Biology and Computer Science are in the Science category, and that the full accreditation runs for a period of five years. Commenting on the development, the Vice -Chancellor, Prof Abu Kasim Adamu, appreciated the efforts of Niger State Government for the financial support given to the university for the exercise  while canvassing for more support towards  the 2020 exercise which will involve 14 programmes. The Vice Chancellor also  thanked  the Ministry of Tertiary Education, Science and Technology under Professor Abubakar Baba Aliyu as commissioner for all the encouragement and support. The  National Universities Commission had organised the accreditation exercise of academic programmes in the university in October/November 2019 to ascertain their viability.
