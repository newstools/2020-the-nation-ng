A windstorm has destroyed a primary school building and a church building in Amakohia Uratta in Owerri North council area of Imo State. It was gathered that the incident, which happened at the Orlu Road Primary School, Amakohia Owerri, on Sunday May 31 2020 also affected the ongoing church building at the Immaculate Conception Catholic Church, Amakohia. The Nation learned that the building is one of the 305 upstairs Rochas Okorocha administration built during his first term. The disaster affected the church fence, ongoing church building, car park and coconut tree among others. The roof of the school building was blown off by the windstorm, which flew the roof of the school to the new church building at Emmaculate Conception beside Rapour Hotel, Owerri The development forced members of the church and residents to express shock, fear and worry. Parish Priest of the church, Rev. Fr. Raphael Akuchie said the church had reported the incident to both Ministry of education and State Universal Education Board. The priest lamented that the commissioner visited scene and asked the church to find way to remove the debris and thereafter apply for fund. He said that the magnitude of the disaster was much, and that the church had been managing since the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown associated with it. A member of the church Frank Chiedozie said it was a thing of thanksgiving that the disaster did not happen during church service. He noted with concern how the entire roof was removed showing the substandard work done by the government. Chiedozie also faulted the position of the commissioner for telling the church to remove the debris and thereafter apply for refund. “It is the duty of the school to undertake the removal of the debris of their building damaged be storm. In doing so, some of the woods and zincs that are okay, they will safekeep them. “Asking the church to do the work looks like it was the church that told the storm to damage the building”.
