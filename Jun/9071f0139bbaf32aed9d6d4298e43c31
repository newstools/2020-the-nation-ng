Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege has extolled the leadership qualities of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rt. Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila on the occasion of his 58th birthday. In his goodwill message to the nation’s Number Four Citizen, Senator Omo-Agege specifically commended him for piloting the affairs of the Green Chamber in tandem with the Next Level Agenda of the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led administration. According to him, Speaker Gbajabiamila’s high intellect and deep knowledge of the legislature is a testament to his rise from the position of Minority Whip in 2005 to Speaker of the House of Representatives in 2019. The governing party, Omo-Agege noted, is proud of the federal lawmaker’s passionate commitment to progressive ideals. “Honourable Speaker, your seventeen years in the Green Chamber dearly attest to your personal qualities including high intellect and deep knowledge of the workings of a legislature; your 14 years as a principal officer, first as a Minority Whip from 2005 to 2007, Minority Leader (Opposition Leader) from 2007 to 2015 and later as Leader of the House/Majority Leader between 2015 and 2019 all reflect your populist and patriotic disposition. “As the first Nigerian to have risen from the position of Minority Leader to Majority Leader and then to Speaker, your passionate commitment to progressive ideals and the people-focused objectives of our party have never been in doubt. “Today, as you mark your 58th birthday, I join members of my family, my constituents in Delta Central Senatorial District and your teeming admirers across the nation and its political divides in wishing you many more years of good health and inspiring leadership,” Omo-Agege said.
