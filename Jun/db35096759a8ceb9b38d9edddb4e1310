Gov. Samuel Ortom of Benue on Wednesday signed three bills passed by the state House of Assembly into law. Ortom signed the bills into law when the Speaker of the House, Mr Titus Uba presented them to him in Makurdi. The bills included the State Health Insurance Agency bill, the Akawe Torkula Polytechnic bill and the Akawe Torkula Polytechnic bill. “What we have done is not just a mere change of names of the institutions but we will restructure them so that they will produce skilled manpower. “We will secure the necessary regulatory approvals in no distant time,” he said. The governor also said that the essence of repealing the laws was aimed at revamping as well as repositioning the education sector in order to meet the challenges of the ever changing world. He stressed that the change in technology had called for reshaping of the education system in the state in order to meet global realities. He called on public spirited individuals to support the smooth take off of the institutions, stressing that government cannot do it alone. He further commended the speaker and his colleagues for the speedy passage of the bills. Meanwhile, the state’s Commissioner for Education, Prof. Dennis Ityavyar, said that the sum of N500 million had been earmarked for the smooth take off of the institutions. Ityavyar further said that N300 million was for Akawe Torkula Polytechnic while N200 million was for Akperan Orshi Polytechnic. Earlier, Uba said that the bills were of immense importance to the people hence their speedy consideration.
