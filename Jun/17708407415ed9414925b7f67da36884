A late penalty from Bruno Fernandes secured a 1-1 draw for Manchester United against Tottenham on Friday night. Fernandes struck from the spot in the 81st minute after Paul Pogba was brought down by Eric Dier. Paul Pogba returned to action for first time since 26 December to earn the late penalty that helped Manchester United with a crucial point in a match with Tottenham Hotspur. Pogba, who has not played for almost six months because of an ankle injury that needed surgery, emerged as a second-half substitute. United keeper David de Gea failed to stop Steven Bergwijnâ€™s powerful 27th-minute drive. Meanwhile, Spurs survived a last-minute scare as referee Jon Moss pointed to the spot again when Dier collided with Fernandes but the video assistant referee correctly reversed a poor decision.
