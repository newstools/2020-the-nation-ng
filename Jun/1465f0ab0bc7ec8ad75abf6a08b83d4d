The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) Ministerial Task Force on City Sanitation on Thursday raided the dreaded Gudu hard drugs colony and recovered some drugs after demolishing their shanties. Three persons suspected to be leaders of the drug syndicate were reportedly arrested with various deadly substances, including packs of India hemp, one knife, bottles of codeine and tablets of other banned drugs, amongst others. Chairman of the task force, Ikharo Attah said there was no going back on the plan to clean up the nation’s capital, and discourage activities that threaten security and safety of residents. He said 11 vehicles believed to be abandoned by roadside mechanics were impounded.
