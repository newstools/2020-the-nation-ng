The Senate on Wednesday confirmed the appointment of Mr. Lamido Yuguda as Director-General of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Also confirmed alongside Yuguda were three Executive Commissioners Nominees namely; Mr. Reginald Karawusa, Mr. Ibrahim Boyi and Mr. Temidayo Obisan. Their confirmation followed the submission of the report of the Committee on Capital Markets which was presented before the Senate by the Chairman, Senator Ibikunle Amosun. Amosun in his presentation, said the nominees were experienced and suitable for the job and therefore,  recommended their confirmation. Recall that the President Muhammadu Buhari had last week asked the Senate to confirm Lamido Yuguda as the new Director-General of the SEC. The president also sought confirmation of Karawusa, Boyi and Obisan as full-time Commissioners of the Commission. Speaking after the nominees were confirmed, the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan,  said, “the Security and Exchange Commission must be efficient and effective in ensuring that we are able to attract and sustain not only domestic investment but foreign direct investment. “People should bring their monies and feel safe with their investments here. This is essential to create the very enabling climate for investors to be attracted and retained here in the country.”
