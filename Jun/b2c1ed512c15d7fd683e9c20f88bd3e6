An official of Ifo Local Government Area of Ogun State who assaulted a woman, Mrs. Tolu Adesh, for refusing to part with N15,000 bribe has been arrested, it was gathered. The woman, who was arrested for allegedly flouting lockdown order, recorded the official demanding bribe. The incident occurred on Saturday afternoon inside Ojodu-Abiodun LGA secretariat in the presence of the woman’s husband. The woman beater identified as Mr. Peter was captured in the video spinning acrobatics, slapping and even pushing down the woman’s phone and ordered that their tyres be deflated for refusing to pay N15,000. On the video shared on Twitter the woman said she and her husband were on their way to a mall. “We were stopped at the intersection between Lagos and Ogun State (which isn’t properly marked) by Ogun State Taskforce officials who informed us that there was total lockdown in Ogun State during weekends and since we were in their territory, we had to get a pass from their LG office which is about three minutes away. “They seized my husband’s ID card and requested that we drive them to the office. We refused. I agreed to walk with the official while my husband drove behind us to their office. “When we arrived, we were handed over to the man in the video who told us we would pay a fine of N15,000 for disobeying the lockdown that was in place.” The woman tagged Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun and some human rights activists to the post, demanding justice. The LGA Transition Chairman, Fola Salami in a statement said the man has been arrested and all members of the team suspended without salary.
