 A close associate of the Super Eagles midfielder  Wilfred Ndidi has said for the umpteenth time that the former Nath Boys FC star  will  not quit Leicester City despite huge interest from top European clubs. Yesterday, Leicester City placed a  70m Euros price tag on Ndidi amid interest from Real Madrid, Manchester United, Juventus, PSG and Chelsea. Ndidi has become one of the most sought-after players in the world but the  close associate who pleaded for anonymity  told NationSport that the player would  see through his contract with The Foxes. “I am aware of the offers from various teams in Europe willing to sign up Ndidi but I must tell you that he is happy at Leicester City and he has a contract with them,” the source told NationSport. “Apart from this, he is happy and appreciated at Leicester City, so he is not in a hurry to join any team for now; he is also a regular with the team and the news of a possible exit is not true.”  The source however, said that the interest from clubs is a confirmation of Ndidi’s quality and he hopes to continue to improve his game at Leicester City. Meanwhile, Ndidi reportedly worth around 45m Euros, which placed him as one of the priority of Real Madrid boss, Zinedine Zidane, as he’s way cheaper than other options available. But Leicester City,  according to  owngoal.com, are known to be very tough in negotiations, has insisted on their asking price even if the player push for a move when the transfer window opens. Although Zidane is a strong admirer of the 23-year-old Nigerian, the Coronavirus crisis means clubs do not have enough to spend big on transfers and Ndidi isn’t particularly keen on a move from the King Power stadium.
