 Following Nasarawa State Governor, Abdullahi Sule’s, decision to sack the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Alhaji Aliyu Ahmed-Tijani, there are claims his decision may have angered certain interests. Before the sack, the state House of Assembly’s ad-hoc committee investigating the release of N1billion for the renovation/fencing of public secondary schools in the state in 2018, had indicted the former SSG. But many were certain the SSG wouldn’t get the axe. This was because of the relationship between him and the immediate past governor, Umaru Al-Makura. There is now talk of a rift between Sule and his predecessor. Not a few well-placed party chieftains claim the former SSG’s sack is not unconnected with the alleged brewing disagreement. What is left to be unraveled is the correlation between the assembly’s probe of the SSG, his eventual sack, rumours of rifts and Sule’s second term. For now, all fingers are crossed.
