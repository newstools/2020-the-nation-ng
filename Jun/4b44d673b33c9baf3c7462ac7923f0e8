 The coronavirus pandemic has made many schools across Nigeria, including Igbinedion University, Okada (IUO) to strengthen e-learning offerings.

Over 70 per cent of the institution’s students have enrolled on the OLMS and take lectures in modules. Daily, lecturers upload their notes complete with reading list, course outline, assignments and seminar topics. Students, on their part, are expected to complete their assignments and send via the portal to the respective lecturers for grading, and result sent back to them. Postgraduate students are not left out. They are expected to present seminars through the e- conferencing system which allows the accessors interface with students. Arrangements are being made to enable students also defend their thesis through Zoom, a tele-conferencing software. So far, the university has conducted continuous assessment tests (C.A.Ts) on the platform and the results were released last week of May. From today, final year students are to begin their project defense virtually on the OLMS in line with the approved 2019/2020 Academic calendar.
