Oyo State COVID-19 Task Force headed by Governor Seyi Makinde on Tuesday said it is yet to relax the ban on religious activities and curfew imposed as a result of the pandemic. Speaking through his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Taiwo Adisa, Makinde said the decision was reached after a meeting of the Task Force which held online for over two hours. The Governor added the Task Force is still evaluating the situation in the state and would not be able to follow the decision by the Presidential Task Force, which relaxed the ban on religious gathering and curfew. He explained the position was informed by the ongoing risk and situation analysis being undertaken by a team of experts. Makinde said: “The Oyo State COVID-19 Task Force wishes to alert the public that the ban on religious gathering remains in force in the state. The 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew earlier imposed on the state as a result of the ravaging pandemic, will also remain in force until further notice. “This is because the Task Force is awaiting a risk, situation analysis report by a team of experts earlier commissioned to do so. “The report is expected at the end of the week and it is only after the report has been analysed by the Task Force that it can be in a position to make further clarifications. “The Task Force will always make its decisions in relation to the behavioral patterns of the novel Coronavirus in its domain, relying on science, logic and data. “We assure residents that the state is leaving no stone unturned in curtailing the spread of the dreaded virus.”
