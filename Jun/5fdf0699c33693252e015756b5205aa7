Nigerian striker Brown Ideye is weighing up his options at Greek club Aris amid Coronavirus epidemic. The vastly-travelled joined Aris in June 2019, on a one-year contract, said he would decide his future at the end of the on-going 2019/2020 season campaign. “I had a conversation with the director of the club (Aris) and I’ve told him that I will finish the season in Greece,” the former Bayelsa United was quoted as saying in the interview aired on Greek Mega Channel. “But I will travel to my homeland, I’ll then decide if I will continue next season with Aris.” The 31-year-old who was sign by Aris last year on a reported annual fee of 500,000 Euros said his final decision will not be motivated by what would accrue to his pocket. “The most important thing is to have a good time in the club; then comes the money because we are professional athletes and live from it,” he said. The 14 top-flight Greek league had been on break since March due to the Coronavirus pandemic and Ideye said the lockdown gave him the opportunity to improve his culinary skills as well as his dexterity with FIFA PlayStation. “I spent my time reading books and also improved on FIFA PlayStation but as per cooking, I ‘m very good at everything,” he said.
