Members of the Unity Forum of the Ondo State All Progressives Congress (APC) and 28 support groups have given Chief Olusola Oke N22.5m to enable him purchase nomination and expression of interest forms of the APC. Oke was last month named consensus aspirant of the Unity Forum but other nine aspirants refused to step down from the race. Presenting the cheque to Oke at Akure, Ondo State capital, former Deputy Governor and leader of the Unity Forum, Alhaji Ali Olanusi, said they decided to make direct financial contribution to the electioneering expenses of their flag bearer to promote a sense of belonging by all party members. Olanusi noted that the contribution would remove the toga of winner takes all from the Governor when elected. He stated that the acceptance of Oke has continued to rise daily and convinced all that the choice was apt. He said the display of political maturity and decorum by Oke was an assurance that Ondo State would break away from despondency and nepotism when he becomes governor. The former Deputy Governor called on all members of the Unity Forum to brace up for the direct primary mode of election on July 20, 2020. He urged the APC national leadership to organise a credible and transparent primary so that the most popular candidate emerged. Oke, who thanked the forum for the support fund, said Ondo needed a new leadership to give the people hope. Oke stated that the people were hungry and angry with the Akeredolu’s administration. He said the party’s experience at the 2019 general elections where it lost two senatorial seats and five House of Representatives seats showed that something urgent needed to be done to change the present leadership.
