The Federal Controller of Work in Lagos, Mr Olukayode Popoola, has restated the Federal Government’s resolve to deliver the Apapa/Oshodi/Ojota/Oworonshoki Expressway project on schedule. The Nation recalls that President Muhammadu Buhari flagged off the N73 billion project in November 2018 to address gridlock on the axis, promising to deliver it in two years. During inspection of the highway on Friday in Lagos, Popoola said that the road had achieved varied proportions of completion levels on different sections. He explained that the progress was better to be presented in segments, but that a merger brought the entire projects to about 40 per cent completion level. “On section one here, we have achieved about 22 per cent completion and on section three, it is about 55 per cent. On section four, we have achieved about 20 per cent completion,” he stated. On the completion date, the controller quoted the Minister of Works, Mr Babatunde Fashola,  earlier pledge, as saying “it is still November this year”. While inspecting section one of the project, Popoola said the ministry is carrying out purification; which means, removing  the existing asphaltic concrete and replacing it with stone base”. He explained that several layers of construction went underneath, with up to eight inches thickness of concrete, to make the rigid pavement strong for durability.
