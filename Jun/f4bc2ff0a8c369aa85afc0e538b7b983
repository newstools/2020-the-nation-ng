 TECNO Foundation has donated essential medical supplies to the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) in support of the fight against the coronavirus pandemic in Nigeria. The items handed over to the Lagos office of the NCDC by officials of TECNO Foundation include 100,000 medical masks, 10,000 medical gloves, 1,000 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and 5,000 goggles. Speaking during the handing over, an official of TECNO Foundation, Mr Attai Oguche, stressed the importance of adequately equipping medical personnel at the forefront of the battle against the virus. “Health care workers are the most exposed to the virus because they deal directly with the cases. For Nigeria to win the fight against coronavirus, medical personnel should get all the support needed in terms of equipment and motivation”, Oguche said. “There is a need for material intervention at this time as we collectively battle COVID-19. Obviously, health care workers need more protective equipment to fight the virus and care for the cases. That is why TECNO Foundation is donating today”. Mrs Olajumoke Babatunde, Deputy Director and Head of NCDC, Lagos office, while receiving the donation on behalf of the Director-General of NCDC, Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu, acknowledged the kind gesture of TECNO Foundation. “NCDC is working very hard to protect the health of Nigerians against infectious diseases. We are supporting response activities in the 36 +1 states and the items received will be judiciously utilised to support response activities in these states”, she said. Also speaking during the occasion, Dr. Everistus Aniaku, Deputy Director & Team Lead Emergency Operations Centre Establishment, NCDC, stated, “TECNO Foundation’s goodwill will go a long way in helping us to respond to COVID-19 pandemic in Lagos state and Nigeria because we are here to support Lagosians and protect the life of Nigerians. We sincerely appreciate”.
