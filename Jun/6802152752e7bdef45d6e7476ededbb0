The Chairman House Committee on Aviation, Nnolim Nnaji has urged the Ministry of Aviation and its agencies to ensure adequate personnel is deployed to airports to maintain crowd control and appropriate distancing both at the screening points and boarding gates. This is just as the committee called on the Ministry of Aviation and stakeholders to ensure there is strict observance of safety protocols designed to contain the spread of the pandemic in the industry ahead of flight resumption. Nnaji while acknowledging the successful flight simulation carried out between Abuja and Lagos by the Ministry at the weekend to test run security arrangements put in place in line with the set guidelines issued by the Presidential Taskforce on COVID-19 to safeguard air travelers said authorities were working round the clock to ensure airports are reopened down to unlock the economy. He said: “The test flight which conveyed members of the Taskforce from Abuja to Lagos to assess the various safety measures put in place was necessary to ascertain the safety operational standards of the airports and we are satisfied with the progress and commitment of critical stakeholders in the whole arrangement”. “I’m particularly thrilled by the use of robots to profile passengers and the use of facemasks by passengers for security checks and identification during the flight which showed that the industry was fully determined to provide world standard practice in maintaining first class safety guards at our airports as we gradually reopen some airports to unlock the economy.” The House Committee Chair, Nnaji who represents Nkanu East/West Federal Constituency of Enugu State in the House of Representatives assured the Ministry and its agencies of his committee’s support in ensuring that that industry is rejuvenated as soon as possible because of its pivotal role in the stimulation of the economy. He also stated that his committee will work closely with the Ministry and its agencies to monitor the progress of the entire operations stressing that the success of the first phase of the reopening would determine how soon the entire industry would be unlocked. He reiterated his call for the quick release of grant promised to the sector by the Federal Government to enable the industry bounce back strongly adding that over three months shutdown of flight operations has taken a devastating impact on all the agencies because over 90 percent of their internally generated revenues were dependent on charges directly or indirectly connected to fight operations. Nnaji further appealed to citizens who have no businesses to do at the airports to stay away to avoid unnecessary crowding when the airports reopen stressing that “coronavirus is real and we must exercise every precaution to stay safe”. He stressed: “‘As the nation prepares to gradually open up the air space, Nigerians should be rest assured that the House Committee on Aviation will in line with our oversight mandate, continue to collaborate with the Ministry of Aviation and other critical stakeholders not only to ensure smooth resumption of flight operations but strict observance of safety protocol to contain the pandemic in aviation industry “.
