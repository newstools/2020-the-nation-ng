Chairman of Senate Committee on Army, Ali Ndume, has said his standing as surety for former Pension Reform Task Team (PRTT) Chairman Abdulrasheed Maina was premised on his duty to represent the good, the bad and the ugly among his constituents. The senator representing Borno South told reporters on Wednesday in Abuja that it took him six months to make up his mind to stand as surety for Maina. The Federal Government is currently prosecuting Maina for alleged fraud. Ndume said it was a hard decision for him, adding: “I took me over six months to agree to be his surety. First, the bail condition requires a serving senator, and I happen to be the one. “Second, his health condition is deteriorating and needs special medical attention.  Third, his offence is bailable and, lastly, I am not saying the court should discharge and acquit him. If he is guilty, he will be sentenced.  It was a hard decision I had to make. I have a duty to represent the good, the bad and the ugly of Borno South.”
