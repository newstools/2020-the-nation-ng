Founder of Christ Embassy, Pastor Chris Oyakhilome, has lashed out as church leaders again for complying with the COVID-19 ban on religious gatherings. He described the guidelines as “wicked”, stating they were initiated to muzzle the body of Christ. Some of the guidelines, according to the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), include wearing of face masks, suspension of Holy Communion, social distancing and body temperature check, among others. Oyakilome, The Nation reports, had alleged the coronavirus pandemic was linked to the 5G technology. He also berated church leaders for compliance with government directives on religious gatherings. In his latest televised service, he stated it was odd church leaders were afraid of the virus. He argued that one can’t believe in Jesus and be afraid of touching coronavirus patients and other virus. He insisted what church leaders were inadvertently planning is “persecution of Christians”.
