The Federal Government has re-arraigned former Justice Minister and Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Mohammed Adoke (SAN), at a Federal High Court in Abuja for money laundering-related charges. Adoke, who served during the administration of President Goodluck Jonathan, was arraigned with an Abuja businessman, Aliyu Abubakar, on a seven-count charge. Six of the counts were on Adoke while the remaining one was against Abubakar. Both defendants were, in the charge filed by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), said to have committed the alleged offences involving about N400 million, in Abuja in September 2013. Adoke was accused of, among others, receiving the United States (U.S) dollar equivalent of N300 million from Abubakar and paid the dollar equivalent of N367,318,800 to one Usman Mohammed Bello. He was also accused of using N300 million, which was alleged to be part of the proceeds of unlawful activities, acts classified as offences under the Money Laundering Prohibition Act 2011. The ex-AGF was equally accused of making “structured cash payments in 22 tranches” amounting to N80 million, and another of such structured payments in 13 tranches, estimated at N50 million, into his Unity Bank account. Abubakar was accused of making a payment of U.S dollar equivalent of N300 million into Adoke’s account, in violation of the money laundering law.
