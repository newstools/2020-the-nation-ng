 AKWA Ibom Governor Udom Emmanuel, at the weekend, inaugurated a 300-bed international infectious disease treatment centre. The centre, which was constructed within 30 days, is situated in the premises of the Methodist General Hospital, Ituk Mbang, Uruan Local Government Area. It has a category 3 Virology and Clinical Lab capable of doing a wide range of blood fat and other tests for those who have core morbidities and polymerase chain reactions with PCR machines for testing COVID 19 and HIV as well. It also has 20 self-contained rooms for health personnel and other workers. Emmanuel stated that 25 more containers  of medical equipment acquired by his administration have arrived and would soon be deployed to health facilities in the state. He said his administration decided to set up a PCR laboratory to handle COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. Emmanuel said more ambulances have also been purchased, adding government would acquire many more to be placed at strategic locations to transport people to any general hospital so that we can be well assured of effective health care delivery. He said the situation room set up to tackle COVID-19 would outlive the pandemic and be available for medical emergencies. “Once you call any of our numbers, the ambulance should be able to take you to the nearest hospital or transport you from one facility to the other,” the governor said.
