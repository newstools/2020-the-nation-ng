Chelsea has reportedly tabled an astounding £80 million bid for the Bayer Leverkusen playmaker, in an effort to outbid the other interested party in Real Madrid. Earlier this month, Los Blancos were tipped as favourites in the pursuit of Havertz. However, Chelsea’s latest bid is £8 million higher than the £72 million Real Madrid are willing to pay. In addition, the Premier League giants are also ready to offer the midfielder a five-year contract, worth £8.6 million per year. In contrast, Real Madrid were only willing to pay £8.1 million per year, which, though not bad, could certainly affect Havertz’s decision even though the player himself had reportedly favoured a move to Santiago Bernabeu this summer. Stamford Bridge might not be a bad destination either, especially if we consider Chelsea’s intent in the transfer market this time. The Blues have already secured the services of Hakim Ziyech and Timo Werner, with the latter being a teammate of Havertz in the German national side. The RB Leipzig sensation is already expected to make a major impact in the offensive department for Chelsea next season with his versatility, productivity and pace. The addition of Havertz, in that regard, should add an extra dimension to the club’s offensive unit that has already looked quite promising under Frank Lampard. At the same time, however, it remains to be seen whether or not Chelsea can really afford to sign another marquee attacker, especially when they are in imminent need of reinforcements at the back. They were notably going after Borussia Dortmund’s Roman Burki last month, which might have been a disastrous choice.
