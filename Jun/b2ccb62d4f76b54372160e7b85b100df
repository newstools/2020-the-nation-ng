 Governor Samuel Ortom is not a very happy man as we speak. The Benue helmsman is reportedly wondering how a man he has high regards for as a ‘hunter’ is now being hunted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over allegations that he diverted monies meant to fight criminals in the state to personal use. It is no longer news that the commission days back arrested George Mbessey, Commandant of Benue State Vigilante Group (BSVG), following a petition over alleged conspiracy, abuse of office and diversion of N449.5 million public funds. What is strange to many is why officials of the state government allowed the suspect to collect funds meant for an agency using a personal account on a monthly basis for newly two years unchecked, unreported. According to the EFCC Makurdi Zonal Office Head of Media and Publicity, Dele Oyewale “the BSVG receives its official funding of N20 million monthly directly from the Bureau of Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs through official account. “Between October 2018 and May 2020, the suspect allegedly collected funds meant for the group to the tune of N449.5 million, using personal account,” the commission spokesperson said. One thing the EFCC has not disclosed is whether the suspect was aided and abetted from within the government. Sentry, however, gathered that the agency may be keeping that close to its chest in order for ongoing investigation not to be jeopardized.
