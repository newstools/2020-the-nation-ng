Lionel Messi and Ansu Fati scored in Barcelona’s 2-0 win over Leganes in La Liga earlier this week. That was Messi’s 56th penalty goal in the Spanish league and is drawing closer to arch-rival Cristiano Ronaldo in the penalty record. Now a Juventus player, Ronaldo, who played for Real Madrid between 2009 and 2018, had converted 61 penalties out of 72 attempts into goals. Messi, who has attempted 58 shots from the penalty spot since his Barcelona debut in 2004, is currently tied with Mexico’s Hugo Sánchez on the list of penalty goals. The Real Madrid legend bowed out of the game with 56 La Liga penalty goals. Next on the list are Barcelona star Ronalad Koeman with 45 penalty goals on his La Liga account ahead of Lubo Penev (Valencia, Atlético Madrid, Compos, and Celta), who had scored 44.
