Immediate past South-South chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Archbishop God-Dowell Avwomakpa, has lost his wife. Pastor (Mrs) Victoria Avwomakpa reportedly died last Friday at 68. The deceased was married to the music-loving cleric for 48 years. She was said to have been down with an undisclosed ailment for several months. Avwomakpa is the founder and General Overseer of Christ Missionaries Crusaders Church in Ekpan near Warri in Delta State. A son of the deceased, Tareri Avwomakpa (Esq.), confirmed the death of his mother via telephone on Sunday. Describing her passage as “a great loss”, he noted that his mother was pivotal to the growth of the church, which has branches across the state and beyond, as well as a great support for their father, Archbishop Avwomakpa. The lawyer added his mother would be greatly missed and prayed for the repose of her soul.
