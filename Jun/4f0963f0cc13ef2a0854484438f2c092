Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, has raised the alarm over the increasing cases of Covid-19 in the state. He attributed the rising numbers to the fact that the virus has reached community transmission phase, adding that the virus had reached an alarming and frightening proportion. In a signed statement yesterday, Okowa said it was regrettable that many persons still think that the coronavirus disease was a hoax. “It cannot be hoax when over 20 persons have died, including some prominent citizens. “Therefore, I want to make a passionate appeal to all Deltans to please realise that the coronavirus disease is real,’’ he said, disclosing that as at yesterday, the number of confirmed cases of the virus in the state was 781,’’ he said. He explained that the state government allowed normal business activities to go on in essential sectors of the economy to enable citizens take care of their families. It does not in any way suggest that the danger is over. “We made this decision with all sense of responsibility while counting on your partnership with the government to defeat this virus. Regrettably, it does appear our people have not taken this matter as seriously as they should. “Our isolation centres are currently overwhelmed with the number of cases and unless we proactively and collectively take drastic actions to reverse the trend, we stand the risk of becoming another epicentre for the pandemic. “In the absence of a specific curative drug, the only way to check the transmission of the virus is for all of us to adhere strictly to the NCDC-issued guidelines and safety protocols,” he said.
