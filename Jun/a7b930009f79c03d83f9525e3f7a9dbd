Suspected herdsmen have reportedly attacked some farmers in the Mutum Daya area of Nasarawa State. President of Tiv Development Association (TIDA) in the state, Boniface Ifer said some of the farmers were wounded while some fled following the attack last week. Ifer said the assailants took over the farmlands after the farmers fled. “We are no longer safe except Nasarawa State and the federal government take our security seriously because we cannot defend ourselves,” he said.
