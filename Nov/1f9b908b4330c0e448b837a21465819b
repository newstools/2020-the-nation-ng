 FIRST City Monument Bank (FCMB) has urged business owners to keep pace with current and emerging realities in the corporate environment, especially on taxation, in order to make their respective businesses competitive and enhance overall performance. The lender would want stakeholders to build a more robust relationship that would enable Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs) to effectively understand the country’s tax laws and how it applies to them. FCMB made the submission at a virtual tax seminar it organised in partnership with the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS). The seminar, the third in the series, was under the theme, “Tax and Your Business: An In-depth Discussion”. It recorded over 500 registered SME participants in attendance.
