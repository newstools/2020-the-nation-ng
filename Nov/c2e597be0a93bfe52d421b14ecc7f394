Small and Medium Enterprises, SMEs, as well entrepreneurs can achieve more business successes by engaging in cooperative societies rather than through traditional bank loans. According to the Chief Executive Officer, MBBOV Co-operative Society, Mrs Valerie Ayodele, at the opening of the 15th branch of the company in Isolo, Lagos, many small business owners have been denied the opportunity of expanding their businesses as a result of exorbitant interests on loans from traditional banking institutions. She said the age-long cooperative societies, if revived, could go a long way in strengthening the nation’s economy. “Given the rapid changing banking environment attributed to a lot of factors, including changing demographic composition , digital disruptions, changing aspirations, increased middle class, financial literacy and competition among MFBs, MBBOV plays a very crucial role in fostering joint effort and network. “Our aim is to demystify the gruesome challenge of funding for those who genuinely have entrepreneurial visions and are willing to make a bold step towards the seemingly distant future,” she said. She added: “We believe people can achieve much more together than individually. Entrepreneurs and SME owners can achieve their dreams with or without traditional bank loans. We are convinced that there is post-modern approach to thrift and credit co-operation and we can develop our individual abilities while we grow our collective opportunities and strength our economy.” Mrs. Valerie further said small business owners should bury the impression that cooperative societies “have come to take their money but rather see them as partners in growing their businesses”. She added other places the company is operating include Port-Harcourt, Warri, Abeokuta, Ekiti, Eket, Ogbomosho, Ibadan, Uyo, Mowe, Abuja, Jesse, Mosogar, Agbarho, while plans are underway to open more branches in Ijebu-Ode and Ilorin before the end of the year.
