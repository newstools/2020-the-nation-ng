The Chairman of the Progressives Governors Forum and Governor of Kebbi State, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, has led some governors of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on a solidarity visit to Plateau State. They were there to commiserate with the government over the looting and destruction of public and private properties by hoodlums, who hijacked the ENDSARS protests. Governor Bagudu, accompanied by his colleagues from Yobe, Mai Mala Buni and Jigawa, Abubakar Badaru, said their visit was to sympathise with Governor Simon Lalong over the unfortunate events that led to the destruction of properties worth billions of Naira. He said although the protests were legitimate and supported, criminals hijacked the agitation to perpetrate crimes under the guise of searching for palliatives. He maintained that the governors did not hoard any palliative as wrongly insinuated. The Progressives chairman said: “We have the best interest of our youths at heart and believe that without empowering them, development will be difficult to achieve. This is why the APC government, right from the federal to the states, continues to roll out empowerment initiatives that will build the capacity of the youth and make them productive. We shall continue to engage in dialogue with them to enhance their well-being, so as to address restiveness.” Governor Lalong thanked them for the solidarity and goodwill over the unfortunate incident. He said the destruction has taken the state back, as some of the properties looted, vandalised and destroyed were sources of job creation and industrialisation. Lalong told the delegation that over 31 public and private properties were affected, with losses estimated at over N75billion, which will be difficult to restore. He said he has engaged youths and other stakeholders after the incident to ensure that there is no repeat of such incident.
