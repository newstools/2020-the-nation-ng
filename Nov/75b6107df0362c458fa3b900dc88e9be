 AN emergency meeting of the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has been scheduled for December 8. The party held a similar emergency NEC meeting held at the Presidential Villa. Its Deputy National Publicity Secretary Yekini Nabena said in a statement in Abuja last night that the meeting will review the party’s position and set agenda for its next move. According to the statement, formal invitation has been sent to APC NEC members by the National Secretary of the Party’s Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Sen. John James Akpanudoedehe. It further stated that in line with the COVID-19 public health protocols, “the NEC meeting will be virtual. Login details will be sent to APC NEC members in due course. The meeting is slated for 11am at the Council Chamber, State House, Abuja.” At its last emergency NEC on June 25, the Comrade Adams Oshiomole’s National Working Committee (NWC) was dissolved and a 13-man Caretaker) Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committ (CECPC) under the Chairmanship of Gov. Msi Mala Buni was inaugurated. The Committee got a mandate to reconcile all aggrieved members of the party, resolve all intra-party crises and conduct a national convention or the election of new members of the NWC. Buni-led caretaker committee plans to commence registration and revalidation of party membership register, a move that may be ratified at the next week NEC meeting.
