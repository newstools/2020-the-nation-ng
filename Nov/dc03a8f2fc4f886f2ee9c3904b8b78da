 IN a bid to improve rice production in the state, the Niger State government has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Elephant Group PLC for the concession of the $1.8 million Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) rice mill. The 2.5 ton per hour capacity rice mill which was established at over $1.8 million and commissioned in December 2016 has not been used since its commissioning. Signing the MoU in Minna, the Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Zakari Haliru Jikantoro, explained that after commissioning the mill, the state government considered the need to ensure concrete arrangements for its sustainable operation and management to justify the enormous investment made, hence the decision to the concession it. Jikantoro, who said that the concession period is ten years, stated that other terms of the concession of the mill include an annual concession rate of N25 million and periodic monitoring of the mill by a joint team of representatives of the federal and state ministries of Agriculture, KOICA-Nigeria office and the Elephant Group PLC. The commissioner expressed optimism that the partnership will not only provide more employment opportunities in the upstream and downstream of the rice sector but further solidify the state position as leading producer of quality rice in Nigeria. The General Manager of Elephant Group PLC, Dr Rotimi Fashola, said that work in the mill will take off in December, saying that the mill will produce 40 tonnes of rice daily. He said people in the state should expect good quality and stone-free rice, employment and off-taking the raw materials from the farmers in the state.
