Three Niger State Commissioners have tested positive to COVID-19. Two of the commissioners reported to have tested positive are from Niger South Senatorial zone, while the third is said to be from Niger East Senatorial District. This development has generated tension in the executive council and amongst the staff of the affected ministries. The commissioners were tested when they showed symptoms of the disease after the state executive sitting last week. Secretary of State to the Government (SSG) Ahmed Matane, when contacted, said that directive had been issued to all Commissioners in the state to subject themselves to COVID-19 test. He said  four commissioners have already submitted themselves to the test and the results were negative adding that others are yet to be tested because they are currently out of the state. Matane added that when they return, all commissioners will be tested. He, however, ruled out the investigation are of a spike in COVID-19 cases in the state while advising the people to adhere to the safety protocols. “We are not thinking of another lockdown, but we will continue to watch as things unfold”.
