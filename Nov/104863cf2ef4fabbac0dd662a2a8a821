 THE Federal Government on Monday declared that six states – Kaduna, Lagos, FCT, Oyo, Plateau and Ogun, – account for 84 per cent of the 1,235 COVID-19 cases reported in one week from 22 states. It stated that so far, only eight states account for 72 per cent of confirmed cases because they are testing and reporting steadily. It, therefore, urged citizens with symptoms suggestive of COVID or those who had contact with confirmed COVID patients to present themselves for testing and, if positive, comply with instructions for treatment. Minister of Health Dr. Osagie Ehanire stated these during the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 briefing in Abuja. He said: “Eight states account for 72 per cent of confirmed cases largely because they are the states still testing and reporting steadily. Of 1,235 cases reported in 22 states in the past week, Kaduna, Lagos, FCT, Oyo, Plateau and Ogun, were states accounting for over 84 per cent of cases. “Ten states have shown improvement in testing rates, while 27 unfortunately even recorded a decline between September and October. We shall continue to engage them to strengthen their capacity for active case finding and testing. “We continue to keep vigilance with regards to the exploding cases of COVID-19 in Europe and America by strengthening our capacity for treatment of COVID-19, ensuring that our health workers are kept updated as we continue to see that our health facilities have adequate supplies of medical consumables, including infection prevention and control commodities.”
