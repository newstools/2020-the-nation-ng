There is an urgent need for mathematicians to intervene in the crisis currently rocking the Ondo State House of Assembly. Members are currently at war over what exactly should be the two-thirds of 26 members. It was also gathered that interventions by both the executive and judicial arms of government over the matter have been futile in helping the lawmakers arrive at an acceptable answer. While some members led by Speaker Bamidele Oleyelogun, believe that 17 is the required two-thirds of members of the assembly needed to impeach embattled Deputy Speaker, Iroju Ogundeji, nine other members loyal to Ogundeji are insisting 18 is the correct figure. The impasse over what should be the two-thirds of 26 is the reason why there are two people claiming to be the Deputy Speaker of the house as we speak. Oleyelogun had led 17 members of the House to impeach Ogundeji on allegation of gross misconduct, claiming they secured the required two-thirds majority of the house, and replaced him with Samuel Aderoboye. But nine members of the house have written to Bamidele Oleyelogun, denouncing the impeachment as according to them, seventeen cannot be two-thirds of 26. They added that Ogundeji remains the Deputy Speaker of the House. This explains why Sentry believes mathematicians are needed to end the stalemate.
