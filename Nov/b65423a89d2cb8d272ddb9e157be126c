WHILE Maradona was known for his brilliance on the field, he struggled with drug and alcohol throughout his professional career off the field. Maradona began taking cocaine in the mid-1980s – during the height of his playing days, going on to develop an addiction to drugs and alcohol over the next two decades. His drug use reportedly  began in 1982 and reportedly grew worse in 1984 when he moved to Napoli and had connections with the Mafia. Maradona later made headlines at the 2018 World Cup claiming he ‘drank all the wine’ ahead of their win over Nigeria and was filmed passing out in an executive box.
