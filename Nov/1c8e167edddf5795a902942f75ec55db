 Super Eagles manager Gernot Rohr has acknowledged that the Leone Stars of Sierra Leone will not easy meat to dislodge in today’s 2021 AFCON qualifier in Benin City due to their robust and physical style of play. Rohr hinted that he hopes they would qualify for the 2021 AFCON with games to spare while admitting that he is wary of the tough style of the Leone Stars from what he has seen of their games. Said Rohr: “We are determined to get the job done; we will not underrate them. We already know they are a physical side and they may adopt a similar pattern to frustrate our boys. “We are focused on the goal and the objectives which are to qualify for the 2021 AFCON without putting ourselves in danger of mental sum. We have gone this far and we can turn back,” he added. Yet Rohr expressed worries over the late arrival of his players which he said would have given the team enough time to train together as a team, but relish the discovery of new players  during  the last International break when Nigeria played two international friendly matches against Algeria and Tunisia. “It has not been easy preparing the players for this game because they didn’t arrive on time. Osimhen arrived yesterday (Wednesday) and a few others too. We didn’t have enough training sessions together but we shall cope with it. “We were able to organise two friendly games for the Eagles last month and we were able to see new players like Zaidu Sanusi, Kevin Akpoguma and others who are with us.”
