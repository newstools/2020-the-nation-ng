Paul Pogba is reportedly looking to run down his contract at Man Utd in order to leave on a free transfer. The Frenchman’s current deal expires at the end of next season after United triggered their option to extend it by a further year last month. Pogba has weighed up committing to United for the long-term but, according to The Athletic, now sees next summer as the perfect exit point. By that time he will have turned 29 and will likely be chasing the last big contract of his career. Leaving Old Trafford as a free agent would bring plenty of offers to the table, and Pogba believes he could have “his pick” of the clubs. United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer admitted in his press conference on Friday that Pogba was unhappy after a disappointing start to the season. Only last week Pogba hinted at his discontent while away on international duty. “It’s not that in the club we don’t have fun, but here [with France] it’s not the same. We laugh. It really is a family,” Pogba said. The subject of a new contract for Pogba has been broached but he has shown little interest in committing his future to United, which could force them into a compromising position. Pogba has made no secret of his desire to complete a “dream” move to Real Madrid, and United may look to offload the midfielder in the summer rather than lose him for nothing the following year. United have already seen Pogba depart once already on a free when he left the club’s academy to join Juventus, before buying him back for £89million. Losing him again for nothing would raise further questions over United’s recruitment strategy and bring added scrutiny on executive vice-president Ed Woodward and transfer chief Matt Judge. Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher was in no two minds about what United should do when discussing Pogba earlier this month. (www.newsnow.co.uk)
