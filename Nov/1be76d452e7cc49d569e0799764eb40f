Police in Niger State have arrested three men for allegedly vandalising petroleum pipelines and selling siphoned fuel to the public. The suspects Daniel Joseph, 37, Sunday Ezekiel, 33, and Suleiman Madaki, 29, were arrested in Numba Gwari village in Suleja Local Government Area of the state by police operatives attached to A Division Suleja following a tip-off. One of the suspects, Joshua, said, “Bursting of NNPC pipeline is a thriving business we don’t joke with. It is the quickest way to put food on our table. Any time we burst the pipelines, we are sure of making reasonable money that will last for four months and then we start thinking of how to burst another pipeline,” he said.
