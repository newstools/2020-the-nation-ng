 Nollywood actor, Uche Maduagwu, has thrown shades at Davido and his fiancee, Chioma Rowland, over their relationship. The controversial Maduagwu took to his Instagram account to shade Chioma’s relationship with Davido saying she shouldn’t be deceived by the singer’s constant assurance.  Maduagwu wrote, “Chioma wake up, if Davido wants to get married what will it cost him to do it with you? I am advising you to go on 40 days of prayer and fasting because this is no longer ordinary, your leg has not settled in the Adeleke dynasty without that wedding ring on your finger. Yoruba tradition is very serious, right now the same right other women that have given him a child has is what you have don’t let assurance song deceive you if he can wed you in a music video, why is it taking ages to become real life? Or is he planning to become a Muslim? That beautiful religion accommodates one man and many wives oh.” In 2019, the 27-year-old singer and DMW boss welcomed his third child and first son with Chioma in a UK hospital. He had proposed to Chioma the same year after his father and family members visited Rowland’s home.
