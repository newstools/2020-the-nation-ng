Arsenal forward, Nicolas Pepe, was sent off for a head butt as Leeds’ wasteful finishing cost them a Premier League victory. The Marcelo Bielsa’s Leeds squandered a host of chances before and after Pepe was dismissed after video assistant referee consultation for sticking his head into Ezgjan Alioski’s face. Substitute Rodrigo, Patrick Bamford and Raphinha – deep into injury time on his first Premier League start – struck the woodwork. The Gunners were poor – yet again – and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s 60th-minute effort was their first of two shots on target. Both sides came into the game out of form – with three defeats in their previous four league games. Leeds boss Marcelo Bielsa will be happy with his side’s performance, bar the finishing with opposite number Mikel Arteta relieved to pick up a point. Arsenal remained in the bottom half of the table, moving up to 11th, two points above Leeds in 14th.
