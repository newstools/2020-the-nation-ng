 SIXTY-Six graduates in Ondo State have benefitted from the Federal Governmentâ€™s Graduate Attachment Programme under the National Directorate of Employment (NDE). The graduates were recruited for temporary jobs and they are to be paid N15,000 monthly as stipend during the programme. Ondo State Coordinator of the NDE, Dare Awokoya, said the internship programme was aimed at addressing high rate of unemployment through the provision of transient jobs to youths. Awokoya, who spoke while delivering posting letters to the beneficiaries, said they would be posted to corporate organisations in the state and are expected to serve for three months. He hoped that the beneficiaries could secure permanent jobs at their places of primary assignment or could become self-employed.
