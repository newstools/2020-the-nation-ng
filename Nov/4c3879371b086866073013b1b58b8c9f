The results of the 2020 West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) conducted between August 17 and September 12 show that only 65.24 per cent of the candidates who sat for the examination have Credits and above in a minimum of five subjects, including English Language and Mathematics. The West African Examinations Council (WAEC) announced this on Monday at a media briefing on the release of the results of the 2020 Senior Secondary School Certificate Examination (SSSCE). The examination was earlier scheduled to start on April 6 but could not because of the outbreak of Coronavirus. WAEC’s Head of the National Office, Patrick Areghan, noted that 1,549,740 candidates registered for the examination, while 1,538,445 sat for it. Areghan said 1,338,348 candidates, representing 86.99 per cent, obtained Credits and above in a minimum of any five subjects – with or without English Language and/or Mathematics. He said 1,003,668 candidates, representing 65.24 per cent, obtained Credits and above in a minimum of five subjects, including English Language and Mathematics. Areghan said the results of 215,149 candidates, representing 13.98 per cent of the total number of candidates that sat the examination, were being withheld. He said: “A total of 1,549,740 candidates registered for the examination from 19,129 recognised secondary schools in Nigeria. Of the number that registered for the examination, 1,538,445 candidates sat the examination.” The examination was also taken by candidates from schools in Cote d’Ivoire, Benin Republic and Equatorial Guinea, where the Nigeria curriculum for Senior Secondary School is being used. The spokesman also said the results of candidates representing 13.9 per cent of the total number of candidates that sat the examination were being withheld in connection with cases of malpractice. “The cases are being investigated and reports of the investigations will be presented to the appropriate Committee of the Council for determination in due course,” he said. Candidates who sat the examination and have duly fulfilled their financial obligations can check their results on the examination body’s website: www.waecdirect.org.
