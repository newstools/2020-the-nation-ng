 WIFE of Abia State Governor,  Nkechi Ikpeazu has donated a Toyota Sienna van to para-badminton players just as she pledged her support to the sport in the country. The donation was made on Tuesday when the Badminton Federation of Nigeria (BFN) led by its president, Francis Orbih paid Ikpeazu a courtesy visit at the Government House in Umuahia. The First Lady promised to make the Nkechi Ikpeazu National Para Badminton Championship an annual event while assuring that the second edition will come up during the first quarter of next year alongside a zonal U-17 Championship. She promised to lend support to para badminton players who are on the verge of qualification for the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games. Speaking earlier, Orbih stated that the BFN members were in Umuahia to express the board’s gratitude for the immense contribution of the First Lady to the development of para badminton in the country. He said: “We really appreciate your contribution to the development of para badminton which has led to the growth of the game in the country. You have also shown commitment to the game by sponsoring the Dr. Mrs. Nkechi Ikpeazu National Para Badminton Championship in 2016, the National Para Badminton Team’s trip to the 2018 Uganda International Para Badminton Championship and the 2018 African Para Badminton Championship in Uganda.” “Her Excellency’s support also made it possible for some of the team’s members to be selected by the Badminton World Federation for part sponsorship towards qualification for the Paralympic Games in Tokyo,” Orbih added. The BFN boss lauded the Abia First Lady for her decision to sponsor the second edition of the Dr. Mrs. Nkechi Ikpeazu National Para Badminton Championship with a view to making it an annual event.
