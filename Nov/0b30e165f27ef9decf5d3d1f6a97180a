DAVID Alaba’s agent is reportedly trying to arrange a move to Chelsea for the Bayern Munich defender. Barring a significant U-tun, the Austrian international will leave the European champions on a free in the summer after Bayern recently withdrew their offer to extend his current contract. Alaba had previously been keen on sealing a move to Spain, but has reportedly become more open to the idea of a switch to the Premier League, with Liverpool and Manchester City both credited with interest last month.  Now, though, it seems Chelsea are his most likely English destination, with Sport Bild journalist Christian Falk indicating that Pini Zahavi, Alaba’s agent, is looking to utilise his close contacts at Stamford Bridge. “The clubs who have made contact so far are not Real Madrid and Barcelona, they, at the moment, cannot simply afford him,” Falk told Bild – as quoted by Sport Witness. “Paris Saint Germain are the first option I’ve heard but he doesn’t really want the move. “What will be interesting now is Chelsea. His agent Pini Zahavi lives in London and has close contacts with the club.
