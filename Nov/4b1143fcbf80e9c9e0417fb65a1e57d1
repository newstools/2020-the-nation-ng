A wheelbarrow pusher was on Tuesday crushed to death by an articulated truck in Upper Iweka, Onitsha, Anambra state. The deceased was reportedly killed by the truck driver along Onitsha-Owerri road axis of the commercial city. A witness who identified himself as Okey Umeh said the truck driver veered off his lane due to excessive speeding and crushed the deceased who they described as popular in the area. He said the angry youths were forced to set the truck on fire after the driver and his conductor were whisked away by some group of persons. “The angry youths revenged by setting the truck ablaze. They almost lynched the driver and his conductor if not that they were taken away,” he added. State Sector Commander, Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Andrew Kumapayi confirmed the incident, saying the corpse was taken away by the angry youths. He warned motorists especially truck drivers to abide by the stipulated speed limits in built-up areas to avoid unnecessary road traffic crashes. He said, “At about 0955hrs this morning 10th November, 2020 a male adult whose identify was not captured was crushed to death in a fatal road traffic crash involving a Dangote Truck without a registration number near Zenith Bank Onitsha, along Onitsha- Owerri road. “FRSC rescue team from Upper Iweka Outpost was immediately mobilized for rescue operations only to be intercepted by the angry youths who took the corpse of the victim away.” While commensurating with the family of the deceased, Kumapayi admonished pedestrians to always use the pedestrian bridges where available.
