A Federal High Court in Abuja has issued a bench warrant for the arrest of former Chairman of the defunct Pension Reformed Task Team (PRTT), Abdulrasheed Maina. Justice Okon Abang, in a ruling on Wednesday, revoked the bail earlier granted Maina, who is being tried by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for alleged money laundering. The judge ordered that Maina be arrested in any part of the country he may be found and brought to Abuja to face trial. He also ordered that the trial be continued in the absence of the defendant. Justice Abang gave the defendant’s surety, Senator Mohammed Ali Ndume, up till November 23 to show cause why he should not forfeit the N500 million bail bond he signed to ensure that Maina was always in court. The ruling was on the application by lead prosecuting lawyer, Mohammed Abubakar, who argued, among others, that since Maina had consistently failed to attend court since September, this year, it was obvious he had jumped bail. Ndume, who was on the last date, ordered to produce the defendant yesterday, told the court that his efforts to locate Maina proved abortive. The judge adjourned till November 23 for Ndume to show cause and for the continuation of Maina’s trial in absentia.
