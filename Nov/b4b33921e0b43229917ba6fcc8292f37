The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) at the weekend offered clarifications on the criteria adopted by the Federal Government in re-opening airports for international flights. Its spokesperson, Mrs. Henrietta Yakubu, said re- opening of international flights does not reside with the authority but the Federal Ministry of Health, which gives approval for restart of international flights in line with the Covid -19 Protocols. She explained while airports, such as Lagos and Abuja have since resumed international flights in the first phase, following easing of the lockdown and restriction of flights by the Presidential Task Force on Covid -19 pandemic, the Federal Ministry of Health has the mandate to give clearance for international flights at any airport. She told The Nation it was not FAAN’s responsibility to determine which airports are re- opened but that of the Ministry of Health. She said: ” Recall that airports are re- opened in phases after the easing of the lockdown and restriction on flights. Lagos and Abuja have since re-opened for international flights. Though Enugu Airport, it is the duty of the Federal Ministry of Health to give approval for the re- opening of any airport for international flights.” Kano, Enugu and Port Harcourt International Airports are yet to resume international flights.
