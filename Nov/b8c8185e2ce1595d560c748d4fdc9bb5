Residents of the Oluwa community in Ibeju-Lekki area of Lagos State have pleaded with Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to shelve plans to evict them from the area. They claimed that they were lawful residents of the area, adding that the Oluwa Family’s status as owners of the land was judicially settled two years ago. The community’s Baale (traditional leader) Alhaji Adewale Rosululahi told journalists that on January 16 2018, Justice I.O Harrison of the Lagos State High Court Igbosere declared the Oluwa Family as owners of the land. A copy of the judgment seen by The Nation, declared the claimants, Chief Michael Oluwa, Chief Talibi Mutairu, among others, as the lawful owners of the 888 acres of land in Abule Oluwa. He said the nine-year suit followed attempts by the state to unlawfully evict them. According to him, officials of the state’s Ministry of Urban and Regional Planning recently visited the community and marked several buildings for demolition, a prelude, he said, to their eviction.
