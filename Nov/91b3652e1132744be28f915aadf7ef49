Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde has assured workers of Osun State origin at the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH) that they have nothing to fear because they will not be sacked. He gave the assurance while featuring on Ibadan-based Fresh 105.9 FM Saturday morning. He featured on Southwest Political Circuit, a political interactive programmme anchored by Isaac Brown. Sole ownership of LAUTECH was ceded to Oyo State on Friday by the National Universities Commission (NUC). Makinde also commended his Osun State counterpart Gboyega Oyetola for making the institutionâ€™s splitting possible. He said the success would have been impossible without his cooperation. He insisted that there was no winner in the development but the students who will now enjoy hitch-free sessions. Makinde also pledged better funding of the university with a promise to return it to its old leading position in Africa.
