 Speculative trading on the shares of Nigeria’s leading banks has increased substantially as investors anxiously await third quarter earnings of Nigeria’s largest banks. Five leading banks-Guaranty Trust Bank (GTBank), Zenith Bank, United Bank for Africa (UBA), Access Bank and FBN Holdings, are expected to release their third quarter earnings in the next few days. The five first-tier banks, which control more than two-thirds of the banking industry, traditionally have major influence on the direction of the investment market. The Nation’s check at the weekend indicated that all the banks have concluded arrangements for the release of the nine-month results, which most pundits expected to give clearer pointer of the earnings trend for the fiscal year 2020. The first-tier banks have dominated trading activities at the stock market in recent period, as investors take positions ahead of the release of the third quarter results. Last week, the trio of Access Bank, FBN Holding and Zenith Bank were the three most active stocks at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), accounting for 33.2 per cent of the total turnover for the week. Analysts agreed that third quarter earnings of the ‘big banks’ would have a major influence on the overall share pricing trend in the next few days. Analysts at Cordros Securities said they expected “investors to shift their attention to yet to be published results from the big banks in the week ahead”. Nigeria’s seven topmost banks had grossed N1.77 trillion as top-line earnings in the first half of 2020 despite the COVID-19 lockdowns that disrupted activities for the most part of the period. The seven first tier banks included Guaranty Trust Bank (GTBank), Zenith Bank Plc, Stanbic IBTC Holdings, Access Bank, United Bank for Africa (UBA), FBN Holdings and Union Bank of Nigeria (UBN). They account for more than three quarters of the Nigerian banking industry and are generally refer to as systemically important banks, in reverence to their size and operations. Total gross earnings within the top seven banking group had risen by 7.8 per cent to N1.77 trillion in first half 2020 compared with N1.65 trillion recorded in corresponding period of 2019. Total pre-tax profit dropped marginally by 0.74 per cent from N463.79 billion in first half 2019 to N460.38 billion in first half 2020, driven largely by steep decline in the profit of a bank. Profit after tax rose by 10.13 per cent from N388.87 billion to N428.29 billion. However, the underlying profit-making capacity of the sector declined during the period with average pre-tax profit margin for the top seven banking group dropping from 28.46 per cent in first half 2019 to 26.94 per cent in first half 2020. With the exception of Stanbic IBTC Holdings and FBN Holdings, the two bank-led holding companies within the group, all the other banks suffered decline in underlying profitability. Nigerian banks are required by extant regulations to maintain the Gregorian calendar year as their financial year, with half year ending June 30, every year. A market intelligence report by The Nation had shown that GTB, Nigeria’s most capitalised financial institution, remained the most profitable with a pre-tax profit margin of 48.73 per cent in first half 2020, more than three basis points below 52.19 per cent recorded in first half 2019. Stanbic IBTC Holdings recorded the biggest improvement with pre-tax profit margin rising from 38.04 per cent to 41.41 per cent. FBN Holdings’ pre-tax profit margin also improved from 12.93 per cent to 13.97 per cent. In actual figures, Access Bank had displaced Zenith Bank to emerge with the highest gross earnings but Zenith Bank also displaced GTBank to assume the lead in actual pre and post tax profits. Access Bank’s gross earnings rose from N324.38 billion to N396.76 billion. Zenith Bank’s profit before tax rose from N111.7 billion to N114.12 billion while profit after tax increased from N88.88 billion to N103.83 billion. The two leading banks- GTB and Zenith Bank, generally recorded above-average performance across major indices. On the basis of the first half results,  GTBank and Zenith Bank distributed interim dividend per share of 30 kobo. Stanbic IBTC Holdings paid the highest interim dividend of 40 kobo per share. Access Bank retained its 25 kobo per share while UBA distributed interim dividend of 17 kobo per share.
