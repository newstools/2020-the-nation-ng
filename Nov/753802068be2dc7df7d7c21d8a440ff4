A resident of Ogun State and victim of stray bullet from a yet-to-be-identified police officer in Abeokuta, the state capital, Mr. Kamol Ganiyu, has begged the state government to give him financial help to treat his injured leg to walk well and live a normal life again. Ganiyu spoke yesterday when he appeared before the Magistrates’ Court 1 at Isabo in Abeokuta during the sitting of the State Judicial Panel of Investigation set up to probe cases of police brutality, human rights violations and extra-judicial killings by security operatives in the state. “I need government’s support because in the x-ray I took, it was revealed that my joint has been damaged by the gunshot and a huge amount is needed to fly me out for adequate treatment,” Ganiyu said. The shooting which reportedly caused the damage to his leg occurred on July 17, 2017. The petitioner added that after the incident, “the police officers handling the case called me to Elewe-Eran Police Station, offered me N250,000 and asked me to sign a form that I would not pursue the case in court. But I refused to take the money and sign,” he said. Presenting his case before the panel, the petitioner said: “I was driving and right under Ibara Bridge in Abeokuta, I heard a gunshot which penetrated my car and destroyed my right leg. I fainted after losing so much blood and was taken to the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) at Idi Aba in Abeokuta where I spent over six months receiving treatment.” The respondents, ASP Akeem Jimoh and Inspector Lola Onifade, who were accused of offering Ganiyu N250,000 to bury the case, denied the accusation. But they did not reveal the police officer who shot the victim. Chairman Justice Solomon Olugbemi said the panel got 207 medical bill receipts, eight photographs and a cloth with bloodstains. He added that it also inspected and marked the car with bullet hole as the evidence the petitioner presented to the panel.
