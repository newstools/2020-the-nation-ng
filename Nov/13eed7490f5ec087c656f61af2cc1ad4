 The new Vice Chancellor of Benue State University (BSU), Prof. Tor Iorapuu has, vowed to reposition the institution by enhancing the learning environment and ensuring  stability. He spoke after a thanksgiving mass at Goodshepherd Catholic Chaplaincy of the university to mark his assumption of office. Iorapuu also  promised to set up a centre of entrepreneurship to promote skills acquisition by students. He said: “We want to produce students who can think strategically and not engage in bureaucracy. BSU is the heart and soul of Benue State and, as such, all stakeholders must own it. “My approach and desires are to model the way by building on existing blocks, inspire shared leadership and vision, promote academic excellence, enable others to act through staff welfare and training and encourage the heart with the right attitude. “These pillars will help us in achieving the objective of repositioning the university as a centre of innovation, knowledge-creation, technology-enhanced enterprise learning and adaption as core competencies.” He appealed for cooperation from stakeholders, students and unions including ASUU, SSANU, NASU, and NAAT to enable him succeed. He  urged unions at the national level to call off their strike in the interest of students.
