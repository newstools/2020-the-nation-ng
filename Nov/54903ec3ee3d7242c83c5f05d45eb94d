 GOVERNORS will meet today (Wednesday) to review the effects of the just-ended #EndSARS protests on internal security, the distribution of COVID-19 palliatives and other related issues. Head of Media and Public Affairs of Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF), Abdulrazaque Bello-Barkindo, announced this in a statement on Tuesday in Abuja. The spokesman said the issues would form the main focus of the 21st NGF teleconference meeting scheduled for 2 p.m today. He noted that by the invitation sent to NGF members by the forum’s Director General, Asishana Okauru, the governors would review the internal security situation in the country and the status of the disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), whose activities in some parts of the country led to the recent nationwide demonstrations. The statement added: “Along with this is the overview from different quarters arising from the CACOVID palliatives flag-offs cum distribution and the subsequent indiscriminate looting of various warehouses throughout the country, which resulted from the demonstrations. “As usual, the Chairman of the forum and governor of Ekiti State, Dr. John Kayode Fayemi, will remark on the most contemporary issues affecting the country since the last (20th NGF teleconference) meeting. “In this regard, the Ekiti State governor will be addressing his colleagues on several issues, including a feedback from the villa on the UBEC counterpart funding as schools are beginning to reopen nationwide and the 50th anniversary of Arewa, which took place in Kaduna at the weekend where the chairman and a host of northern governors were in attendance.”
