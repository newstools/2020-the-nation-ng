The Senate on Thursday, urged the State House officials to stop President Muhammadu Buhari, from embarking on foreign medical trips by ensuring that the State House clinic becomes fully functional this year. The Senate Committee on Federal Character and Intergovernmental Affairs, gave the charge when the Permanent Secretary of the State House, Tijani Umar, defended his 2021 budget estimates before the panel. Umar had presented a total budget proposal of N19.7billion for the 2021 fiscal year, out of which N1.3billion was earmarked for the State House Clinic. The Chairman of the Committee, Senator Danjuma Laâ€™ah, in his reaction said the panel would approve the budget for the State House Clinic but that the President and other top officials of his government should no longer be flown abroad for medical treatment.. However, Umar while answering questions from reporters said the State House administration would put necessary arrangements in place to meet the medical needs of the President and other top officials of the presidency once the budget was approved.
