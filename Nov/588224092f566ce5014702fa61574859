Kano, Port Harcourt, and Enugu airports may resume international flight operations before the end of the year, the Federal Government has said. This is just as the government announced the lifting of ban on Lufthansa, KLM and Air France. With the lifting of the ban, the airlines can resume their operations in and out of the country. The government also granted Qatar Airways approval to start operations at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport Abuja. Federal Ministry of Aviation said it was working with the Federal Ministry of Health, the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 and other relevant bodies to ensure that the airports meet all the safety and health requirements and protocols before resuming international flights. Only Abuja and Lagos airports have been operating international flights following the reopening of airports by the government. Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, who broke the news in a statement on Tuesday, said all hands are on deck to ensure that all logistic and policy necessities are in order to address the difficulties encountered by international travellers, especially with the impending yuletide season. In the statement by the Director, Public Affairs, Ministry of Aviation, James Odaudu, the minister expressed appreciation for the understanding and cooperation of Aviation stakeholders in ensuring the smooth reopening of the nation’s airspace. The statement explained that the lifting of the ban on the foreign airlines followed the approval of their respective flight plans and schedules submitted to the ministry of aviation. “In granting the approvals, Senator Sirika emphasised the need for airlines operating in the country to employ international best practices in handling Nigerian passengers, as government will not tolerate any form of maltreatment of its citizens by any airline,” the statement said.
