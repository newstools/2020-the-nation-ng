 CRYSTAL Palace scored three times in an entertaining first half, with Scott Dann grabbing the opener when heading home an Eberechi Eze corner to beat Leeds 4-1. Eze then converted a set-piece of his own, slamming home a free kick to open his account, after Patrick Bamford saw an equalizer controversially ruled out for offside. Bamford did score one which counted, only to see Patrick van Aanholt cross take a big deflection off the sliding Helder Costa, and past goalkeeper Illan Meslier. Palace kept Leeds at bay with relative ease in the second half and wrapped up the win when Jordan Ayew tucked home a Wilfried Zaha pass. It left Leeds with back-to-back 4-1 defeats after losing by the same scoreline at home to Leicester on Monday. An inspirational performance from Eze ensured that Palace moved up to sixth spot as Leeds suffered a second successive 4-1 defeat, although Bielsa must still be wondering why Patrick Bamford’s first-half equaliser was disallowed for offside. But having seen his side fall behind to Scott Dann’s early header, the former Argentina manager will know his defenders made things too easy for their opponents thereafter as Eze’s superb free-kick, a bizarre own goal and Jordan Ayew’s first of the season sealed victory for the hosts.
