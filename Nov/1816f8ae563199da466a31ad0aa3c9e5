Ahead of their visit to Rennes in the French Lique 1, Bordeaux manager Jean-Louis Gasset has revealed that Samuel Kalu won’t be rushed back into action too soon. The Bordeaux number 10 suffered a hamstring injury during the 1-0 loss to Algeria in an international friendly in Austria last month and subsequently missed the double header against Sierra Leone in November. Though Kalu has resumed full training with the rest of his teammates, Gasset has suggested that the Nigeria international is unlikely to be named in the starting lineup in the matchday 11 fixture at the Roazhon Park (Rennes).  “Samuel Kalu resumed training with us on Monday after five weeks of hiatus. You have to be very careful, patient,” Gasset stated. “I don’t think he will start but we will gradually increase him so that he will be there during the month. December. “The matches will be close together, we will need everyone. We sent this message to the group.” Prior to Kalu’s spell on the sidelines, he started Ligue 1 games against Lyon, OGC Nice and Dijon.
