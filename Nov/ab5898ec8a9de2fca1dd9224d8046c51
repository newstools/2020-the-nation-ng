 After a disappointing outing at the 2020 ITTF World Cup, Nigeria’s Quadri Aruna is left to redeem his image at the ITTF Finals to be held between November 19 and 22 in Zhengzhou, China. At the World Cup, Aruna failed to progress to the second round after losing 4-1 to Germany’s Patrick Franziska and Slovenia’s Darko Jorgic 4-2. “I think I was a bit tired after playing with every strength in me in the first match against the German and this really affected me in the second game,” Aruna told NationSport.  “ I have put this competition behind me and I am looking forward to the ITTF Finals which begin on Thursday;  I hope I can do well in the finals to compensate for my early exit in the World Cup.” There are 16 men and 16 women across the globe to compete in the ITTF Finals with the draws taking place on Wednesday November 18 at JW Marriott Hotel Zhengzhou. Meanwhile, it was China’s Fan Zhendong  that beat World and Olympic champion Ma Long 4-3 to retain his  world title for the third time in a row.
