Sierra Leone Coach John Keister said he would not look down on Super Eagles despite Friday’s 4-4 draw in Benin as they approached the reverse AFCON 2021 qualifiers in a different manner. “That we played 4-4 to Super Eagles does not mean we had arrived but we will continue to work harder with the quality of the players we have with the hope that we will continue to improve,” he explained. “I know in Freetown, we are going to be under pressure to get results as it is going to be like Nigeria is playing at home but we will approach the match differently in Freetown,” he added. Meanwhile, President of Sierra Leone Football Association Isha Johansen has tipped her team to score more goals than the  Super Eagles in Freetown.  She  branded the Leone Stars good ambassadors who have written their names in football history against one of the best African teams after Friday’s frenetic draw in Benin. “I must commend the players for their display because before the match I told them that I had a feeling that something good would come out of the match. Fortunately it turned out the way I had predicted. “I am so happy and I had also told my good friend who is the FA boss in Nigeria that we will allow Nigeria to squeeze one goal past the post while we do all the other goals in the match.” she insisted.
