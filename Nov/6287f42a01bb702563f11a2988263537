MANCHESTER CITY full-back Kyle Walker scored the winner against his former club as Sheffield United’s winless start to the season continued. Pep Guardiola, who had suffered his worst five-game start to a season after taking just eight points, saw his team’s domestic frustrations alleviated by Sheffield-born Walker’s 28th-minute strike at Bramall Lane. City, buoyed by Tuesday’s 3-0 Champions League win in Marseille, were on top from the outset and only a fine display from Aaron Ramsdale limited the damage.  The result leaves Chris Wilder’s side still winless, while providing a confidence boost for a City outfit whose next top-flight clash is at home to champions Liverpool. Ferran Torres’ glancing header from Joao Cancelo’s cross forced a fine early stop from Ramsdale, who also saw Aymeric Laporte steer a close-range effort just past his near post. Rodri’s ferocious 25-yard strike was too hot to handle as the goalkeeper parried it over the crossbar in slick conditions amid heavy rainfall in Sheffield.
