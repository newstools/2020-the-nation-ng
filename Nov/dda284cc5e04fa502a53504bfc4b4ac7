 PAUL Obazele, former President of the Association of Movie Producers, has endorsed Bebuzee, a new free-to-watch online source for Nigerian entertainment and news content. Obazele, who noted that the platform is a well-packaged medium for entertainment and news, was delighted to see Bebuzee unveil its upcoming video and content streaming service. Already, the Bebuzee has partnered with more than fifty Nollywood producers to gain exclusive rights to their content before launching its free to subscribe platform to the public. With its brand ambassador program, Paul Obazele becomes the newest popular personality to affiliate with Bebuzee in spreading the word of this unique and localized service set to debut in December. Bebuzee claims over sixteen million users so far in the African continent and is expanding to more African countries first in its effort to become a worldwide force in video content, challenging Netflix and Amazon.
