 Jesse Adesotu Woghiren’s Bigmanity music group is planning big as the last quarter of the year gradually winds down. Adesotu and his label teammates at the Bigmanity Music group are majorly working on musical contents that are poised to reshape the face of the Nigerian music scene. The multi-talented actor, songwriter, and label owner said ‘most major record label executives are greedy song sharks. “They don’t have the gift and ability to write and or craft great song materials, and therefore have no respect for true value and appreciation for the process (the hard work, pain and time) in which a hit song comes alive, neither are they able to comprehend or empathize from the point of the up and coming struggling real talents,” Adesotu said. He further said that his Bigmanity Music is positioned for the passion of the industry and the core understanding of real and genuine talent is a requirement. “Our industry connections speak for itself, as we have done business with or dealt directly and indirectly or been contacted by labels in the U.S.A from Universal Records, to Capital, Hollywood Columbia/Columbine, even my dear brothers Lil Wayne and Dr. Dre, we have had positive and negative situations that short-changed us in the past, but once bitten, twice shy,” he said.
