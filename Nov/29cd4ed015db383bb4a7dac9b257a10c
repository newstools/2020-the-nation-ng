 MANCHESTER City ended their paltry Premier League goal return in style. After scoring only 10 in eight previous matches this was Pep Guardiola’s side at their silken best beating Burley 5-0. Riyad Mahrez was the star turn with a hat-trick completed on 69 minutes, his header created by Phil Foden’s clever dink, the youngster having only entered moments before. With Liverpool dropping two points earlier in the day, the win closes City to six points from the champions, having played a game fewer. Despite starring against Olympiakos Foden began as a replacement, alongside Raheem Sterling, while Sergio Agüero was not in the 18 as City welcomed visitors who could not gaze at recent history for a boost. Guardiola’s side had beaten Burnley by an aggregate of 15-0 in their last three outings here and today City needed only six minutes to open proceedings. James Tarkowski’s loose pass that went to Rodri was punished as the latter fed Ferran Torres. Suddenly City were in as Kevin De Bruyne tapped possession to Mahrez and his left foot finish beyond Bailey Peacock-Farrell was slide-rule precise.
