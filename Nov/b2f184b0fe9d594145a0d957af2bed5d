 OVER 300 persons suffering from goitre, lumps, fibroids, appendicitis, hernia and eye-related diseases were successfully operated in a free surgical festival in Kontagora, Niger State. Patients from across the state and parts of other northern states benefitted from the surgical festival which was held to commemorate the 78th birthday of the father of the state governor, retired Colonel Sani Bello. Speaking with newsmen while visiting the beneficiaries of the surgical festival and the surgeons, the former Governor of Old Kano state, Colonel Sani Bello said, “If I had given a party, it would only be attended by the elites in the society but I have decided to give this birthday gift to the public. As you can see, it is only the sick who are here to celebrate with me. “I feel happy when I see smiles on the faces of the people. That is the reason why I gave up the normal celebration of birthday and embark on medical surgeries like this one. It is my way of thanking God for sparing my life.” Director-General of the Sani Bello Foundation, Mr. Zakari Ikani said the medical outreach is one of the legacies of the Colonel Sani Bello who is the Chairman and Founder of the Sani Bello Foundation.
