Sixteen persons have been confirmed dead in last Saturday’s road accident in which a trailer conveying bags of rice rammed into a market. The accident, which occurred at the Ibaka area of Akungba Akoko, South-West Local Government Area, was said to have been caused by break failure and loss of control. The deceased included eight men, four children and four women. The bodies were reportedly deposited at the Specialist Hospital, Ikare and General Hospital, Iwaro Oka mortuaries by the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) emergency rescue teams. Corps Marshal Federal Road Safety Commission Boboye Oyeyemi, who gave the figures in an update, called for the relocation of markets from the highway. Dr. Oyeyemi, in a statement by the Corps Public Education Officer, Bisi Kazeem, said the relocation of markets from the highways was necessary to reduce crashes and help operational efforts of the FRSC. The statement said: “The Corps is concerned about the rising statistics of innocent citizens who have lost their lives as a result of building markets close to the highways and has since initiated impact oriented operational strategies to curb the menace. “The strategies, no matter how good, will not yield desired results if the government at the grassroots did not rise to the responsibility of relocating those markets.” Some protesting youths blocked the Ikare-Owo highway over incessant accidents on Akoko roads. They carried placards with the inscriptions: “Incessant motor accidents a danger to our existence ,” “Untimely deaths too many in Akungba,” “Akeredolu come to our aid “ They had earlier burnt the trailer conveying the bags of rice. Injured victims of the accident are to be treated for free.Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, who said this yesterday when he visited the scene of the accident, commiserated with the bereaved families. He attributed the cause of accidents to recklessness on the part of drivers and faulty vehicles.
