The Federal Government has said an outbreak of yellow fever is responsible for the recent “strange deaths” in some states, including Delta and Enugu. Health Minister Dr. Osagie Ehanire made the clarification yesterday while addressing State House Correspondents after this week’s virtual Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari at the Aso Rock Presidential Villa in Abuja. The minister said the government was investigating the disease outbreak by collecting samples and conducting research to ensure accuracy about what happened. “Yes, there was an outbreak that started in Delta and was found in Enugu and then two other states, making it a total of four states. The analysis we have done so far shows it is yellow fever. “So, the response has been going on from the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC); vaccination is going on in all these areas. “Few days ago, there was also a report from a member of the National Assembly. He said in his constituency, there were unexplained illnesses and deaths and that alarm also immediately triggered a response. The NCDC has been directed to carry out investigation. “As we speak, they have to collect samples, do tests and do some laboratory investigations before we are sure of what exactly it is and what the cause is. So, the response is going on automatically and we shall get result very soon,” he said. Enugu State has been battling to contain the outbreak of the disease in two communities – Ette Uno and Umuopu – in Igbo-Eze North Local Government Area. But the disease has now spread to Nsukka, Isi-Uzo. Delta State recently reported that 22 deaths were recorded in Ika North East Local Government Area of the state due to the outbreak of the disease.
