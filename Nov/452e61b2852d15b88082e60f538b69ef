 THE Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Mr. Sunday Dare has charged that the maiden edition of the National Youth Day celebration should be used to reflect, take stock and chart a new youth action plan that tackles the issues that confront Nigeria’s teeming youth population. The Federal Executive Council this year approved every November 1 as National Youth Day. In his address at the event, the minister noted that now is the best time to celebrate the youth and validate their contributions to national economic development against the backdrop of all that the country has witnessed in the past three weeks. He said: “with the protests that have occurred across the country Nigeria stands at the cusp of change in youth development. Already, that change has begun. What is needed is to deepen the youth initiatives and accelerate the onboarding of beneficiaries in a transparent and effectual manner. “Nigeria must license a new tribe of youth investment banks with single digit loans dedicated to our youth. Through the NYIF, the FG has set the tone and is leading the way. “Today, on the occasion of the National Youth Day we showcase to the world 10 winners of the 60-day APP challenge competition and 5 young innovators in different fields. 15 youth who represent the lot and remind us of the power of our youth.”
