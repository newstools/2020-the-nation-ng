Former Barcelona midfielder Ivan Rakitic has denied that there’s a rift between star player Lionel Messi and French forward Antoine Griezmann. Griezmann signed for the Catalan giants in the summer of 2019 from Atletico Madrid, but has struggled to properly integrate himself into the Barca starting XI. It’s been reported that Messi and Griezmann don’t see eye-to-eye. However, former Blaugrana midfielder Rakitic has denied this, stating that the pair do indeed get along. “What I saw was that they got along very well. I got along wonderfully with Antoine and Leo,” Rakitic told Spanish outlet El Pelotazo. “The two drinks mate together and spend a lot of time together in the dressing room.”  “If both of them start to score goals, there will be no more talk – that’s the requirement and expectation of a great team like Barcelona. I don’t worry, though, because they’re two spectacular guys. I wish them all the best.” Arsene Wenger has previously claimed that Griezmann isn’t being utilised in his correct position, due to the presence of Messi. Barcelona paid £107m (€120m) for the French star’s services two summers ago. He has scored 17 times in 57 games in all competitions.
