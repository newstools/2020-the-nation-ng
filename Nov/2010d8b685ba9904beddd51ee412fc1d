A new wave of COVID-19 infections could further disrupt life-saving health services, WHO Regional Director Dr. Matshidiso Moeti has warned. The analysis by the foremost health agency of five key essential health service indicators, which include outpatient consultation, inpatient admission, skilled birth attendance, treatment of confirmed malaria cases and provision of the combination of pentavalent vaccine in 14 countries, finds a sharp decline in these services between January and September 2020 compared with the two previous years. According to Moetti, the gaps were the widest in May, June and July, corresponding to when many countries had put in place and enforced movement restrictions and other social and public health measures to check the spread of COVID-19. During these three months, services in the five monitored areas dropped on average by more than 50% in the 14 countries compared with the same period in 2019. “COVID-19 pandemic has dealt a heavy blow to key health services in Africa, raising worries that some of the continent’s major health challenges could worsen.” Figures Monday showed that the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide has surpassed 50 million. A WHO dashboard showed that globally, as of 10:45 am CET (0945 GMT) yesterday, a total of 50,030,121 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 1,252,072 deaths, had been reported to the UN health agency. Monday’s figures showed that the U.S. remains at the top in both confirmed cases and deaths, reporting 9,763,730 COVID-19 cases and 235,562 deaths. “The COVID-19 pandemic has brought hidden, dangerous knock-on effects for health in Africa. With health resources focused heavily on COVID-19, as well as fear and restrictions on people’s daily lives, vulnerable populations face a rising risk of falling through the cracks,” he said. He, however, advised that in order to withstand future shocks, a strong health system should be the bedrock for emergency preparedness and response.
