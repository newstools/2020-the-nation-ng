 NIGERIA International Victor Osimhen has apologized to his Napoli’s teammates and specifically coach Gennaro Gattuso after his sent-off in the 90th minutes in the Europa League tie against Real Sociedad. With the red card, Osimhen will miss their next Europa League match against Rijeka and this has been described as a major blow to Napoli. But yesterday according to La Repubblica, Osimhen apologized to Coach Gattuso and his teammates for the mistake made, while promising to repay their confidence in the Serie A. Osimhen was shown a red card in Napoli’s 1-0 triumph over Real Sociedad in the Europa League clash. The Super Eagles striker who joined Napoli in a record transfer from Lille of France was sent off by referee Craig Pawson in the third minute of added time for a second caution. Osimhen replaced Italian forward Andrea Petagna in the 61st minutes but got his first caution in the 81st minute before being given his marching orders 12 minutes later after elbowing Robin Le Normand while trying to control David Ospina’s goal kick. This was the first time the 21-year-old striker was sent off since he moved to Europe in 2017. He is expected to miss the Blues’ trip to Stadion Kantrida for a date with HNK Rijeka on November 5.
