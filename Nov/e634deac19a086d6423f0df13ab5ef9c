A 50-year old man Kamoru Smaila has been arrested by men of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC) for allegedly raping a 10-year old girl. Smaila was almost lynched by a mob when NSCDC officials got to the scene and rescued him in Akure, the Ondo state capital. Spokesperson for the Ondo NSCDC, Olufemi Omole, confirmed the arrest and promised to issue a statement on the incident. He was yet to do so as at press time.
