Adamawa Governor Ahmadu Fintiri has accused opposition forces of sponsoring critics and thugs to undermine his administration Fintiri, who spoke to newsmen in the course of inspecting projects around the state capital, Yola, charged the opposition to appreciate his projects and join him in advancing the cause of the state. “They should not be sponsoring thugs to destroy our Commonwealth, they should come and see what we are using public funds for,” the Governor said. The governor, who said unconstructive criticisms serve no public good, stressed he is using funds for capital projects, which he said should be appreciated. Ongoing projects which the governor inspected during the weekend include Dougire Lane, Government House back gate road, Doctors Quarters, Zumo Street and Link, Lagos Street Off Army Barracks road, Falu Road and links, among others, all within the metropolitan Yola North and Yola South local government areas. Fintiri, who said his intention is to build a state that can compete with other developed states, vowed that no amount of pressure will deter him from executing people-oriented projects. “I expect the opposition forces to come and see how government’s funds are judiciously utilized for the common good of the citizenry,” he reiterated, declaring that despite the activities of hoodlums who last Sunday and Monday vandalised government and private warehouses and stores, his administration would not be distracted from its projects. He expressed satisfaction with projects being carried out under the Urban Renewal Programme, assuring that he would continue to strive to meet with the yearnings of Adamawa people. Out of the eight road projects that Fintiri reached during the inspection of Saturday, those of Dogirei Lane and Lekki Tabba streets, both in Jimeta, Yola North LGA, had been completed.
