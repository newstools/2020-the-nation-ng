We worked closely with our customers to gradually recover from the economic impact of the pandemic and the attendant effect of the lockdown” said Fidelity Bank CEO Nnamdi Okonkwo. He explained that the drop in Gross Earnings was due to the decline in interest and similar income caused by lower yields and drop in fee income.  ”Net fee income declined by N1.3 billion largely due to a reduction in FX related income on account of the revaluation gains recorded in first half of 2020. Fidelity Bank has over the years implemented a retail digital banking strategy and that has continued to deliver, with the bank on course to achieving the seventh consecutive year of double digits growth. “The growth in Savings Deposits accounted for 40.2 per cent of total growth in in Customer Deposits and Savings Deposits now represent 25.7 per cent of total deposits, up from 22.3 per cent in 2019” he enthused.
