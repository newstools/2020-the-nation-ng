Vice-president Yemi Osinbajo has emphasised the essence of peace-builders and mediators in tackling some nation’s challenges. Osinbajo spoke on Tuesday while hosting a delegation from the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue (HD) at the Presidential Villa in Abuja. A statement by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Office of the Vice-President, Mr. Laolu Akande, said Osinbajo also noted that those involved in peace-building process and mediation should be home-grown. “Every discussion around peace and mediation in solving some of the security challenges that we have is one that we consider of utmost importance given where we are today,” he said. The Vice-President lauded the work of the organisation, which has been in the country since 2013. Osinbajo stressed the need for collaboration with such an organisation in order to address some of the nation’s challenges. He welcomed a notable feature of the centre for engaging and employing locales in the work of peace and mediation in their communities and country. “It is important that those that mediate are homegrown, like yourselves; those who have an understanding of the space, who have more or less grown up here, worked here, because they understand the issues,” he said. Osinbajo added: “I am glad to see a strong team of professionals and diplomats, people who have an understanding of our society and what the issues are. This will greatly help the quality of the work.”
