 If you run into Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State, don’t be surprised if he is not smiling. This is because currently, he is in a fierce battle to save the state’s purse from pilfering ghosts. Yes, ghosts. Only that they are actually human beings working in various local government secretariats across the state. Last Wednesday the state government announced it lost N230m annually to ghost workers. It also said not less than 362 absentees (workers) were discovered on the payroll of the local government service after thorough screening and verification. Consequently, the governor wasted no time in moving against the ghosts and their collaborators. According to him, the money recovered would be used to attend to other government obligations to workers. But findings by Sentry revealed that the governor and the Commissioner for Local Government Affairs, Prof. Adio Folayan, are now under immense pressure to leave the ghosts and their promoters alone in the name of party politics. Reliable sources hinted that some prominent chieftains of the governor’s party may have some knowledge of how the ghost workers came to be, given their interest in seeing that Fayemi allows the harmful practice to continue. Sentry learnt the governor is determined to end the practice in spite of efforts to make him do otherwise.
