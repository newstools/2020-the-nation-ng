 SINCE returning to action after a six-week lay-off, the performance of Joe Aribo has continued to thrill fans of Rangers FC in the Scottish Premier League (SPL). Following Aribo’s performance in Rangers’ 1-0 win over Kilmarnock at Rugby Park on Sunday, the fans could not hide their excitement over the quality of the Nigerian as some of them took to their social media to express themselves. The fans have been drooling over Aribo in the first half of the action against Kilmarnock. Aribo, 24, is clearly back to full fitness after a two-month spell on the sidelines with an ankle injury he sustained in mid-August after impressing in the opening stages at Killie. Although it was James Tavernier’s penalty that put Rangers ahead, Aribo’s creativity and flair in and around the box was one of the biggest talking points among fans on Twitter. With him in the side, Rangers just always seem to have that extra bit of threat in their attack and fans really enjoyed watching the Nigerian in full flight on the plastic surface in Ayrshire, with one saying that he is “in love” with him. In several of their tweets captured after the encounter, the fans believe the Nigerian has the quality to lift the fortunes of Rangers in the SPL.
