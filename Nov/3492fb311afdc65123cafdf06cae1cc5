 OMONIA Nicosia midfielder Shehu Abdullahi  been drafted by Coach Gernot Rohr as a replacement for FC Midtjylland ‘s injured defensive midfielder Frank Onyeka for the 2021 Africa Cup of  Nations(AFCON)  qualifiers against Sierra Leone. Onyeka  reportedly completed the 90 minutes of action in FC Midtjylland 4-0 home win over FC Copenhagen on Sunday but news filtered in that the midfielder sustained an injury in the  course of the game. He was therefore excused from the double header  against the Leone Stars  slated for November 13th and 17th  respectively at the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium in Benin City and Siaka Stevens Stadium in Freetown.
