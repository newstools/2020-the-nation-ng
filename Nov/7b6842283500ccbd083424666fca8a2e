The Speaker of the House of Representatives Rep. Femi Gbajabiamila on Tuesday said the House was determined to pass a Petroleum Industry Bill that will be acceptable to all Nigerians within the next six months. Speaking when he received a delegation of the Oil Producers Trade Section (OPTS) of the Lagos State Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Gbajabiamila said “there are two things that the House would want to do. First, the House is determined to pass the bill within the next six months, or probably less, because the clock has already started running from the time it was presented. “Two, the House is determined to pass a PIB that is satisfactory to all. I know it’s difficult to satisfy everybody, but we will try our best to satisfy everybody.” The Speaker said the House will carry all stakeholders along in working on the draft legislation until its passage and asked members of the OPTS led by their Chairman, Mr Mike Sangster, to avail themselves the opportunity they have at hand to reach out to the House Adhoc Committee on PIB to make their inputs.
