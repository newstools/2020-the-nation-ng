World Health Organisation Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Monday a working vaccine alone will not end the coronavirus pandemic. He said communities and individuals must still be engaged. The comments come as U.S. pharmaceutical company Moderna announced that its COVID-19 vaccine is 94.5% effective in late-stage trials. Speaking remotely to WHO’s executive board, Tedros said it is important to emphasise that a vaccine will complement other tools, not replace them. Tedros said once a vaccine is given final approval and is ready to be distributed, supplies will initially be limited. He said health care workers, older people and other at-risk populations will be prioritised, which hopefully will reduce deaths and ease the strain on health systems. “That will still leave the virus with a lot of room to move,” he said. He added that there will still be a need for testing, contact tracing and isolation.
