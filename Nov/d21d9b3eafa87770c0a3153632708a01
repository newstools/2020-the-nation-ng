A Federal High Court sitting in Lagos on Wednesday warned against contempt after police officers allegedly attempted to arrest the embattled Managing Director of HealthPlus Ltd, Bukky George, on the court’s premises. Mrs George is challenging her removal as Chief Executive Officer in a suit involving HealthPlus Ltd, HealthPlus Africa Holdings Ltd, Dr Ayo Salami, Ms Afsane Jetha, Zachary Fond and Deji Akinyanju. The alleged arrest attempt occurred after Justice Oluremi Oguntoyinbo had adjourned to November 16 and 27 for ruling on who should represent the first defendant and for a hearing of the substantive suit. George and her lawyer, Chief Bolaji Ayorinde (SAN), who had already left the room, rushed back in. They informed the judge that the police were outside and attempted to arrest George, contrary to an earlier undertaking by the defence. Ruling on Ayorinde’s application for the court’s protection, Justice Oguntoyinbo said: “The court will not fold its arms and allow anarchy in a case pending before it. “Consequently an order of status quo is hereby made. Nobody should take any step that will undermine the decision of this court. If anybody does so, such will be in contempt of court.”
