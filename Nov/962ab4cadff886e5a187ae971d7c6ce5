The police in Ogun State have arrested three members of a robbery syndicate which before now terrorised the Iju/Ota area of the state. The suspects – Bamidele Oluwashina (31); Adebowale Kehinde (32) and Oluwasegun Abayomi – were arrested on November 12 while robbing at Iju Love bus stop, Ota. They attacked one Tosin Ajayi, and cut him on the head. He was however rescued by the police and taken to the hospital. Police spokesman Abimbola Oyeyemi, in a statement on Sunday, said officers at the Onipanu Divisional Headquarters acted on a tip off that the suspects had stormed Iju Love bus stop and tipper garage, attacking people and robbing them, about 9:31pm. They thus mobilised to the scene and engaged the robbers in a gun duel. One of them was arrested while the others fled. The area was however cordoned off, and a search initiated. Two others were arrested while trying to flee in a tricycle. A local pistol and two live cartridges were recovered from the suspects. Oyeyemi said the suspects will be moved to the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (SCIID) as directed by the Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, for further investigation and prosecution.
