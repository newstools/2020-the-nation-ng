 The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Friday in Abuja made virtual and public presentation of its `Report of the 2019 General Election’. The commission also made public presentation of the ` Review of the 2019 General Election: Report of the Commission’s Retreats and Stakeholder Engagements’’. INEC Chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, while presenting the two reports said that the `Report of the 2019 General Election’ has 13 Chapters covering major issues. These according to him include challenges associated with the preparation and conduct of the election, lessons learnt and specific recommendations for addressing them. Yakubu said that the second report “the Review of the 2019 General Election’’ contained 180 recommendations including recommendations for test running and adoption of e-voting as well as adoption of early/special voting for election duty and other related officials.  Other recommendations are: “Such defectors should automatically lose their seats except in the case of merger of two or more parties,’’ it said. The report recommended that funding of political parties from budgetary allocation should be restored. It, however, said that this should not be tied to the election campaigns but for the purpose of maintaining infrastructural facilities and membership registration. The recommendations, according to Yakubu, either require administrative action by the commission or amendments to strengthen the existing electoral legal framework by the National Assembly. (NAN)
