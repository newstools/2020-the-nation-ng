A property caretaker, one Matthew Ahiwe, has been arrested in Abia State for allegedly stabbing one Chigozie Eluwa, a co-tenant, to death. Ahiwe was arrested on Saturday by police in Umuahia South Local Government Area of the state. Eluwaâ€™s colleague, Chigozie Obinna, linked his death to a long-running feud between him and the suspect. Obinna said Ahiwe issued Eluwa a quit notice, adding that Eluwa was on the verge of getting another accommodation before he was killed. A police source confirmed the incident, saying the case has been transferred to the State Criminal Investigation Department for further investigation.
