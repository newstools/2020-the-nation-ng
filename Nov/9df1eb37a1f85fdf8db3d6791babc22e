 Members of the Church of Christ in all Nationâ€™s (COCIN) in Jos, the Plateau State capital, were thrown into a joyous mood on Saturday after learning about the release of Reverend Polycarp Zongon from Boko Haram captivity. He was released late Friday, according to sources. Zongon was abducted on Monday 19th October, while on a trip outside the state. The group later showed him in a video it released to the public. Sources at COCIN described the release of Reverend Zongon as a miracle considering the antecedent of the terrorist group. The pastor of COCIN Wild Life Park arrived Jos yesterday.
