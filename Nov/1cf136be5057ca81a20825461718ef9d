The Women’s Under-17 World Cup in India shifted to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic was on Tuesday postponed to 2022. The decision was taken by the Bureau of the FIFA Council, which took stock of the current global COVID-19 pandemic and its continuing impact on football. The FIFA cancelled the women’s U-17 World Cup and U-20 World Cup, which were scheduled to be held in India and Costa Rica respectively but handed both the countries the hosting rights of the 2022 editions. ‘’With the inability to further postpone these tournaments, the FIFA-Confederations COVID-19 Working Group subsequently recommended that the 2020 editions of the two women’s youth tournaments be cancelled and that the hosting rights for the 2022 editions be offered to the countries that were due to host the 2020 editions. ‘’Following further consultation between FIFA and the respective host member associations regarding the 2022 editions of the tournaments, the Bureau of the Council has approved Costa Rica as host of the FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup 2022 and India as host of the FIFA U-17 Women’s World Cup 2022 respectively,’’ FIFA said in a statement. Originally scheduled to be held in five venues in India from November 2 to 21, the FIFA U-17 World Cup was pushed to February 17 to March 7 next year due to the pandemic.
