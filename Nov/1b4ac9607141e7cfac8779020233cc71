 Delta Commissioner, Basic and Secondary Education, Mr Patrick Ukah, has accused politicians of circumventing posting of teachers to rural areas. Ukah, who spoke recently when he appeared before the state House of Assembly Committee on Education in Asaba, said the challenge has had a negative impact on its vision to ensure improved standard in rural communities. He urged the committee to stop politicians  from mounting undue pressure on ministry officials to post relatives to urban centres. He also identified unchecked vandalism of school properties as another factor militating against educational standards. His words: “The level of vandalism we are witnessing in our schools at present is worrisome. Almost every year,we keep providing furniture to some of the schools yet, there is a dearth of chairs as the ones we provide is always vandalised. To address the challenge, the Ministry has set up an advocacy committee made up of traditional rulers, youth bodies and vigilance organisations that will help check the ugly trend.” Chairman, House Committee on Education, Charles Emetulu, assured of the committee’s readiness to address the challenge through effective legislation.
