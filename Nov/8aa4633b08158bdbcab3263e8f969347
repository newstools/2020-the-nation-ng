Borno Governor Babagana Zulum has expressed satisfaction with the conduct of the local government election in the state on Saturday. The Governor, who expressed his satisfaction while casting his vote at his hometown in Mafa, also commended the State Independent Electoral Commission for the conduct of the exercise. He said it was gratifying that voters massively turned out for the exercise. But the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state condemned the entire process, accusing the ruling APC of conniving with the electoral body and security operatives to rig the poll. Borno PDP Publicity secretary, Amos Adziba, in a statement said what transpired during the election was contrary to the broadcast of Zulum, where he called for a free and fair election. “The APC are in collusion with State Independent Electoral Commission in which they have taken aggressive steps mostly through inducement, manipulation, and incarceration using the element of State power including Nigeria Police force and other security agencies. “The SIEC must live up to its responsibility to correct these anomalies, considering the fact that even the governor came out publicly yesterday on a live broadcast that the polls should be free and fair. Unfortunately, the reverse is now the case today,” the PDP alleged. Recall that the governor yesterday in a statewide broadcast to the people of Borno State for the purpose of the election called on the actors to play the game by the rules. Governor Zulum who was in his hometown in Mafa on Saturday cast his votes amidst cheers from his people. About 18 out of the 27 council chairmen are standing unopposed for the election.
