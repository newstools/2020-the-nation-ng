 CHAIRMAN of Ajeromi/Ifelodu Local Government Area (LGA), Hon. Ayoola Fatai has assured that more football pitches will be built this year to engage the youths. Speaking with journalists on Thursday, Fatai encouraged youths to “shun violence and hooliganism’ and encouraged them to engage in sports and farming in order to improve themselves and for the betterment of the society.” Speaking on work done, so far, the chairman said; “What we are doing in schools is to provide them with sports facilities. There are some schools with football pitches, basketball court and table tennis court.” “We have inaugurated the Odion Ighalo football pitch. We encourage youths to emulate Odion Ighalo so as to be celebrated. We are doing a Five-a- Side competition where the winning team gets N1m, and runner-up gets N500, 000. We are promising between 12 to 15 new pitches by the end of December this year. The chairman said the LG is not leaving behind school sports. He said: “What we are doing in schools is to give them sports facilities. There are schools with football pitches, basketball court and table tennis court.” Fatai advised youths to shun violence. “Our youths must be productive. How many of them are in farms, and in the environmental sector? In 2018, we distributed machines and hair driers to youths and women, they sold it off. It is not about the inaccessibility of government, it is about taking responsibility. We must also encourage good values in our society,” he added.
