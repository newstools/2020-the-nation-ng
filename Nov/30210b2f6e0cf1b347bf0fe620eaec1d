 VOLKSWAGEN (VW) has returned to profit in the third quarter, mirroring upbeat results of peers including Daimler and Tesla as robust demand in China helped the car industry navigate the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. Operating profit before special items was €3.2b, rebounding from a loss in the second quarter, the company has said. VW also reported better-than-expected sales in the three months through September. The world’s best-selling vehicle maker benefited from its large footprint in China, where sales have bounced back to pre-crisis levels. But a second wave of surging infections across North America and Europe and a partial lockdown in its home market Germany risk choking a wider recovery. Several competitors have pointed out that the coming months are difficult to predict after the coronavirus already shuttered factories and showrooms in the second quarter, triggering billions of euros in losses. VW’s results add to growing evidence that the motor industry has dealt with the pandemic better than feared. Carmakers from Ford to BMW and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles reported better-than-expected results in the past weeks. Toyota Motor earlier last week said its global sales rose two per cent in September from the same month in September, spurred by strong demand in China and the US. VW’s shares rose 2.9 per cent in Frankfurt, valuing the company at about €67b. They have fallen by more than a quarter in 2020. In Europe, where VW runs most of its factories, the virus is once again threatening to curb sales. Germany and France decided to clamp down on movement for at least a month, coming close to the stringent lockdowns in the spring as Europe seeks to limit the spread of the virus. While the region’s two biggest economies will shutter bars, restaurants and non-essential services, they are allowing most businesses to operate.
