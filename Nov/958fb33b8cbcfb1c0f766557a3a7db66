  The Progressives Governor’s Forum, led by its chairman and Kebbi State Governor Atiku Abubakar Bagudu yesterday night paid solidarity and condolence visit to their Lagos State counterpart, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, over the destructions visited on infrastructure and businesses during the #EndSARS protests. Those in the entourage were Governors Mai Mala Buni (Yobe); Simon Lalong (Plateau) and Muhammed Badaru Abubakar (Jigawa). Speaking with reporters, Bagudu lauded Sanwo-Olu for the leadership he demonstrated during the crisis, saying he was everywhere just to ensure things did not get out of hand. Bagudu said though they had sent a condolence message earlier, they were in Lagos to encourage Sanwo-Olu and his team and show solidarity with the people of Lagos, “to tell them we are all in this together”.  He added: “Sanwo-Olu remained committed till today and finally the state is making progress today and the truth is evolving gradually. “We encourage him, we appreciate the people of Lagos and we already see economic activities picking up. We commend the resilience of the Lagos people and we believe Lagos is back on track and will mobilise the nation.” Bagudu said violence does not solve any problem, but rather compounds it. “Now, we know better; our young ones have expressed their opinion and we have to listen and dialogue with them. We support them though their noble course was hijacked by undesirable elements. “We want our young men and women to have fulfilling jobs, both locally and internationally, but this takes time and needs serious engagements and dialogue,” he said.
