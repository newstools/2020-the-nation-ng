 Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said he is not worried about his position after his side slumped to their worst start to a season since 1981 with defeat at home by Wolves in a game overshadowed by a nasty head injury to visiting striker Raul Jimenez. The Gunners sit 14th in the table after five losses in 10 league games – a year to the day since Unai Emery was sacked at head coach – and have been beaten in their past three matches at Emirates Stadium. “It’s something that the day I decided to be a coach I knew that one day I would be sacked or leave the football club but I don’t know when that is going to happen,” he said. “In this profession, I know it will happen but I never worry about it. “My only concern is to get the best out of the players and give the best possible service to the club.” A game between two of the Premier League’s lowest-scoring sides was disrupted by a sickening clash of heads between Jimenez and David Luiz in the opening exchanges that led to the Mexico striker receiving treatment on the field for 10 minutes before being taken to hospital. It was understandably flat for a time after that but flickered into life when Pedro Neto slotted home from close range after Leandro Dendoncker had headed Adama Traore’s teasing cross against the bar midway through the first half. Gabriel equalised for the hosts with a thumping header from a Willian cross just three minutes later but Wolves were the better side throughout and re-established their lead when Daniel Podence cleverly converted after keeper Bernd Leno fumbled Neto’s drive. Arsenal rarely threatened, with striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang little more than a spectator at times, and Arteta has much to ponder with his side languishing in the bottom half. Wolves, on the other hand, are up to sixth and sit just four points off the summit in an increasingly congested top half of the table.
