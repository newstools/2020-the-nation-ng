The police in Rivers State have nabbed a notorious kidnapper on its wanted list identified simply as Daniel along the Bonny waterways. The suspect was arrested shortly after his gang attacked a passenger boat heading for Port Harcourt, the state capital. It was learnt that the sea robbers waylaid the boat around Asarama area of Andoni Local Government Area and robbed the travellers of their belongings. Sources said the incident that occurred on Thursday morning left one of the passengers dead and many others injured. Some of the passengers were said to have jumped into the water during the attack while the driver of the robbers also mistakenly fell into the river. But the suspects reportedly abandoned their driver, who was later saved by divers taken to where other passengers were kept at the shore. It was gathered that the passengers identified the driver of the hoodlums and handed him over to the police. A source, who spoke in confidence said: “We arrested one of the pirates. He is their driver. His name is Dan Clifford George. One of the passengers that was attacked and escaped identified him”. The Police Public Relations Officer, Nnamdi Omoni, who confirmed the development said police had launched manhunt on other fleeing members of the gang. He said: “I can confirm the incident that happened on Bonny river. Daniel Clifford George from Asarama in Andoni Local Government Area. He is on police wanted list. He was arrested alongside others. “We have also gone after the others that fled. They are helping us in getting information. They are members of a gang of pirates terrorising the Bonny River”.
