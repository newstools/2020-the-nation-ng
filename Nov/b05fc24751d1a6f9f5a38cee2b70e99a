Confirming the Kara Bridge explosion, the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) said it responded to the incident around 1:05am. LASEMA’s Director General (DG), Dr. Femi Oke-Osanyintolu said emergency responders comprising Lagos Fire Service and LASEMA officials were attacked by a group of “Fulani boys brandishing dangerous weapons” adding that the rescuers were forced to seek extra police cover from the Isheri Police Station. “The operation commenced with the police protection until the group of assailants grew larger and caused significant damage to vehicles and threats to life of our personnel. The team has been forced to suspend the recovery operation for safety reasons. “It is of note that this attack is part of a very worrisome trend of first responders being attacked in the course of their duties. Lagosians are urged to refrain from endangering the lives of emergency responders and to allow them carry out their lifesaving duties.”
