The Lagos State government on Monday warned worship centres and religious groups to intensify adherence to safety protocols to avert a second wave of the virus following developments in European countries. This was even as the state government enjoined the residents to eschew violence and tolerate one another to continue to enjoy peaceful coexistence. Speaking at the 2020 International Day for Tolerance, Commissioner for Home Affairs Prince Anofiu Elegushi said there was need for the worship centres to take the issue of safety protocol adherence very seriously to avoid another spike of the pandemic. The commissioner said the state government would continue to need the level of tolerance and cooperation received during the spike of the pandemic, adding that the cooperation assisted the government in the level of successes recorded and the rate at which the COVID-19 curve was flattened. He said: “ At this juncture, let me reiterate and admonish our beloved people not to relent supporting and understanding the efforts of the Lagos State Government,  we should not let down our guards, as it is not yet “Uhuru”, the battle against this dreaded virus is yet to be over. All guidelines and safety protocols of mitigating against the COVlD-19 should still be stringently adhered to. “We are all aware that some countries such as the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and France among others are currently experiencing the second wave of the virus. We cannot afford to allow this to happen. I beseech us to continue to use our face masks, wash our hands frequently, and maintain social distance in public places while also using alcohol-based hand sanitisers from time to time to combat infection or transmission. I believe together, we shall overcome the scourge.”
