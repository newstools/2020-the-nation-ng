 The Acting Pro-Chancellor McPherson University,Prof. James Nda Jacob, has appealed to the Federal Government to include private universities in the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND) scheme. He spoke at the institution’s 5th Convocation ceremony which held at the weekend on its campus in Ogun State. “The university still needs nurturing through provision of more infrastructural facilities and funding. ‘’As partners with God and the government in preparing the next generations of skilled and ethical professionals, we once again, appeal to the government to collaborate with private institutions, like ours, through their inclusion in TETFUND and also through relaxed taxation,” he said. The Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Adeniyi Agunbiade, noted that  the COVID-19 pandemic did not disrupt academics as the institution deployed online learning to maximum effect. He stated that examinations were  also successfully conducted online. He said: ” The university swung into online academic mode to maximise time during the COVID-19 pandemic that threatened all industries and nations of the world. Our students were thoroughly briefed at the commencement of the second semester of the 2019/2020 academic session that e-learning would substitute conventional physical classroom contact as mandated by the NUC. The reports from the four colleges were largely positive and progressive. Examinations were successfully conducted online.” The VC said the varsity got approval for the establishment of Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences which began operation with the Bachelor of Nursing Science (B.N.Sc.) Degree programme with effect from the 2019/2020 academic session.
