 THE Akin Fadeyi Foundation has burst a group of students of the Afe Babalola University, Ado-Ekiti, (ABUAD), Ekiti State, blackmailing young girls who fall victim of sharing their nudes on social media. Founder and Executive Director of the foundation Akin Fadeyi, during a virtual news conference, said the foundation got report of the blackmail and extortion through its ‘Flag It App’ created for the public to report corrupt, decadent and Gender-Based violence (GBV) cases to the foundation. Fadeyi said in collaboration with the authorities of ABUAD, the foundation was able to unmask students behind the cartel and sued them. He said: “The cartel include Ofoyeno David Junior, a 300-Level student of Media and Communications, Omokolade Israel Aiyedogbon, a recent graduate of the University; Darlington Emojeya, 300-Level Engineering and Oyedele Adeolu Akinsola, a 300-Level student of Political Science.” The suit is being heard at the Federal High Court II in Ekiti, and has been adjourned till December 10.
