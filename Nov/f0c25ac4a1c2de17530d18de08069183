Leeds United suffered another heavy defeat with a 4-1 loss at Crystal Palace in the English Premier League (EPL) on Saturday. Marcelo Bielsa’s side, who were beaten by the same scoreline at home by Leicester City on Monday, slumped to 14th place with the defeat. Crystal Palace moved up to sixth, on 13 points, just three points behind leaders Southampton. Scott Dann headed Crystal Palace into a 12th minute lead with a thundering header from an Ebere Eze corner-kick. Leeds United thought they had drawn level with a nice finish from Patrick Bamford but the effort was ruled out for a narrow offside by VAR. After that let-off, Crystal Palace then doubled their lead with a brilliant free-kick from Eze, his first goal for the club, a 20 metre shot into the top corner. Bamford did get on the target with a confident drive after he was set up by Polish midfielder Mateusz Klich’s headed pass and buried the ball in the bottom corner. It was his seventh goal of the campaign. But Crystal Palace restored their two-goal advantage, just before the interval. That was when Helder Costa’s sliding tackle deflected a low cross from Wifried Zaha inside the near post, confounding Leeds United goalkeeper Illan Meslier. Zaha had a hand in Crystal Palace’s fourth goal, running at the Leeds United defence before slipping the ball to Jordan Ayew who made no mistake. (Reuters/NAN)
