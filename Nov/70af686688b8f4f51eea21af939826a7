 ARMED robbers have invaded a divisional police headquarters at Igueben, Edo State, killing two policemen and injuring many others. The criminals also stole a large cache of arms and ammunition. The two policemen who died in the attack were identified as Monday Asoata, an inspector, and Esangbedo Ezekiel, a corporal. The injured men were taken to various hospitals in the state. The attack took place on Monday night, it was learnt. Anonymous sources at Igueben told The Nation on the telephone that the robbers accessed the divisional headquarters after throwing dynamite into the station to destabilise the policemen on duty. Amid gunshots, the hoodlums headed for the armoury, where there looted arms and ammunition. It was gathered that policemen who tried to prevent the attack were killed by the robbers. Shortly after the attack, residents of Igueben took to the streets to protest the invasion. The residents urged Governor Godwin Obaseki and Police Commissioner Babatunde Kokumo to ensure a thorough investigation and arrest of the criminals. The protesters attributed the attack to the October 19 looting and razing of seven police stations, and the attack on two correctional centres in the state, leading to the escape of 1,993 inmates, who immediately returned to crime. Police spokesman Chidi Nwabuzor confirmed the attack. He said: “On November 9, 2020, at about 19.30hrs, hoodlums suspected to be armed robbers invaded the police station at Igueben. Immediately, the police personnel mobilised to repel them. “During a gun duel, one of the suspected armed robbers was shot dead, two policemen were wounded and they were taken to the hospital. No policeman was killed in the attack. “The police are doing their best to weed out criminal elements in that axis (Igueben) of the state. As I speak, normalcy has returned to that part of Edo.”
