SIMY Nwankwo delivered the perfect riposte to being left out of the Super Eagles squad to face Sierra Leone next month as he grabbed his third league goal of the season in Crotoneâ€™s loss to Atalanta in Serie A. The lanky 28-year-old who has been capped four times for Nigeria last played for the national team in the 2-1 loss to Argentina at the 2018 World Cup in Russia and he was overlooked once again by Gernot Rohr for the doubleheader Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against the Leone Stars.
