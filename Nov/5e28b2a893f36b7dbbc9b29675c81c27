 ARMED robbers have invaded the Christ Apostolic Church in the Gudugbe Alagbon area of Wasimi in Ewekoro Local Government Area of Ogun State. The hoodlums reportedly beat up several worshippers as they robbed them. They also abducted one worshippers before escaping into the forest under the cover of darkness. Police spokesman Abimbola Oyeyemi confirmed the attack yesterday, saying the hoodlums invaded the church during a vigil on Friday night. Abimbola told The Nation that the abducted woman has been rescued safely, naming  the suspects as Abubakar Ibrahim, 38, Sulaiman Yusuf, 32, Ismail Yusuf, 20, Umar Aliu, 26, and Yinusa Musa. He said the suspects were arrested after one Obisesan Seye, pastor of the church, put a distress call to the police, saying his church was under attack by six men armed with dangerous weapons. Oyeyemi said policemen attached to the Ewekoro Division combed the  forest, fished out five members of the gang and arrested them. The sixth suspect was said to be on the run. According to Abimbola, the victims of the attack have identified the five suspects as their attackers. He listed cutlass, two cudgels and assorted charms as items recovered from them, explaining that they would be transferred to the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department for further investigation.
