The Minister of State for Power Goddy Jedy-Agba has denied having a hand in the detention of Publisher of Power Steering Magazine, Tom Ohia. In a statement by his Special Assistant on Media and Communications strategy, Mr. Ofem Uket, the Minister said the police detained the journalist having secured the warrant of arrest to pick him up after he turned down their invitations. According to the statement, the publisher alleged in its July 2020 edition of the magazine, that the Minister bribed the Nigerian Police in 2012 to suppress investigations into the ill-fated Dana plane crash conveying passengers from Abuja to Lagos. He was also said to have alleged the crash was masterminded and orchestrated by the Minister when he served as Group General Manager Crude Marketing at the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation NNPC. According to the statement: “The Minister is only a complainant to the police having suffered libel in the hands of Tom Ohia, the publication was injurious and attempted to link the minister with the act of terrorism.” Uket said the one-man magazine, which fragrantly disregards the ethics of objectivity, also disputed the report painstakingly carried out by the Accident Investigation Bureau (AIB) clearly and sufficiently analysing the dual failure of the engine of the airline. The statement recalled the AIB report did not mention Jeddy- Agba either as one who masterminded or orchestrated the ill-fated air crash. It added: “To set the records straight, the minister has no hand in the detention of the journalist, as the police have secured a remand order to keep him until his date of appearance in court. “The media industry has to urgently reed the profession of quackery and specialised blackmail by some acclaimed publishers of unknown quantity newspapers and magazines, certainly not circulated beyond a few communities.”
