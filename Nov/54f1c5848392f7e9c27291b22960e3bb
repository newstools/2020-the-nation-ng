 LEICESTER City’s trip to Leeds United provides an opportunity to continue the Foxes’ impressive results on the road, says Kelechi Iheanacho. City will meet Leeds for the first time since a Carabao Cup last 16 tie in October 2017, when Iheanacho was on the scoresheet in a 3-1 home win. Both sides are now riding high near the top of the early Premier League standings, with Iheanacho looking forward to the opportunity of facing the Whites again. He believes Leeds’ early season form indicates that the Foxes will be presented with a tough task to overcome them at Elland Road on Monday evening (8pm kick-off). “It will be a great opportunity to play them once again,” the 24-year-old told LCFC TV.  It was my first Leicester City goal, it was a great goal so hopefully if I get a chance then I will be able to do the same, it will be a great occasion. “I’ve played against them before. It was my first Leicester City goal, so hopefully if I get a chance then I will be able to do the same, it will be a great occasion. “They are back stronger now and they’ve been doing well and having a good run in the Premier League. I think it will be a good test for us and hopefully we can get the points that we need.” Iheanacho was on target in Leicester’s 3-0 UEFA Europa League victory over Zorya Luhansk.
