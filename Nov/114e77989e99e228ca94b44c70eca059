The Ondo State chapter of the Academic Staff Union of Secondary Schools’ of Nigeria (ASUSS) has cautioned the Senior Special Assistant on Special Duties to Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, Dr. Doyin Odebowale, to desist from making an unfounded allegation against teachers in the state. It said it was unacceptable and unthinkable for any political appointee to make allegations against teachers in the state without any proof. Dr. Odebowale had told journalists in Akure that his office received reports that teachers in the state were engaging pupils in domestic chores in their houses and in farms on the guise of teaching the pupils’ agricultural practical. He said any teacher caught would be sanctioned and prosecuted. According to Odebowale, “We gathered that some teachers in schools in rural areas have formed the habit of using pupils to work in their private farms under the guise of doing agricultural practicals. Some send female pupils to be cooking for them.” But the Ondo ASSUS challenged Odebowale to mention names and schools where teachers were using students for home chores and farm work. State Chairman of ASUSS, Comrade Tajudeen Balogun, called on Governor Akeredolu to call Odebowale to order and stop dragging names of hard-working teachers in the mud. “Let him (Odebowale) go to any school in the state, all teachers are very busy now with their official duties because many things had been lost to long holiday caused by COVID-19 pandemic. “We have the best crops of teachers in Ondo states. Nobody should drag our names in the mud. We advise Dr. Odebowale to stop making wring allegations against us. “We urge that he (Odebowale) should courageous enough to name who send students on private farms or works. We, therefore, want to congratulate Mr. Governor, Arakunrin Oluwarotimi Akeredolu on his recent reelection,” Balogun said.
