The ITF Director-General said each of the beneficiary trader would get N30,000 to boost his or her business. A representative of the “50 Million Africa Women Speak Project”, Mrs. Lami Magaji, urged women to take advantage of the programme to support themselves and their households. She enjoined women traders to form association and open bank accounts, advising that those who benefitted should utilise fund judiciously.
