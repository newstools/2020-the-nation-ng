A distraught mother, Mrs. Esther Tanko, has accused men of the disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) in Abuja of complicity in the disappearance of his three year-old son, Elijah Tanko, since September 9, 2019. Mrs. Tanko gave details on Tuesday of how her son was taken from her while presenting her petition before the investigating panel set up by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) to hear allegations of impunity against SARS and other units of the police. The mother said her son was abducted from her in Bwuari, Abuja, while she was hypnotised by some individuals on her way from work. She said when she regained consciousness, she reported the incident at the Bwari Police Station Mrs. Tanko added that some months later, she saw an announcement on television that some children had been found and that anyone whose child was missing should report at the nearest police station. The distraught mother recalled that when she saw her son among the children shown on television that day, she immediately went back to Bwari Police Station where she had reported the case. “I told them that I had seen my son on the news and was able to identify him,” she said. After listening to her presentation, the panel’s Chairman, Justice Suleiman Galadima (retd.), adjourned till December 2 for the police officials, named as respondents, to present their case.
