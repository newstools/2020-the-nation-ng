 SECRETARY of the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Caretaker Committee Senator John Udoedehe has warned party members in Akwa Ibom State to stop fighting over the 2023 governorship ticket. Udoedehe said he remains the party’s authentic candidate. The party chief, who addressed a news conference in Uyo yesterday to mark his 57th birthday, said those who fought him before he joined the APC have regrouped to fight again over the party ticket in 2023. He said: “When I led the opposition many years ago, those fighting me were in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). I told them that change would take over the country and they never believed. Those who fought me are in APC now and they have perfected their plans to fight me again, even in APC that they hated.” The senator advised the people to vote for APC in 2023 to attract development to the state. He also blamed the youths for plans to outsmart their elders by floating a juvenile party against the elders in 2023, saying such moves were counter-productive. “When I became the chairman of Uyo Local Government Area at 33 years, I never stopped my elders. As a Senator, I was the Chairman Senate Committee on Privatisation without smiting my elders. Why should the youths plan to bench their elders now?, he queried.
