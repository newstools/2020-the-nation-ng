MANCHESTER United midfielder Paul Pogba could miss their Premier League trip to Southampton on Sunday after failing to shake off an ankle injury, manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said. Pogba was last in action for France in their 4-2 victory over Sweden during the international break this month, which he controversially described as “a breath of fresh air,” and missed United’s 1-0 league win over West Bromwich Albion and Tuesday’s 4-1 Champions League victory over Istanbul Basaksehir. The 27-year-old had missed a large part of last season with an ankle injury and Solskjaer said that his current problem is not a recurrence.
