 DESPITE leaving the office years ago, ex-President, Goodluck Jonathan, still commands respect and attention when he speaks or enters a gathering. Recently, he was spotted at the 2020 Adult Harvest Thanksgiving of Church of the Nativity, Parkview, Ikoyi, Lagos, and he was the center of attention.  The former president thanked the church for inviting him to be the father of the day.  He also pledged his support for the church project. Earlier, Venerable Tayo Adeloju expressed appreciation to the Almighty God for another thanksgiving witnessed in good health and sound despite all that is happening in today’s world.
