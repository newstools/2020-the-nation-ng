THE Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa (CAPPA) has flagged off the campaign #SmokefreeNollywood to stop smoking in movies and music videos in the entertainment industry to protect young Nigerians. At a press briefing held in Lagos at the weekend, CAPPA Executive Director, Akinbode Oluwafemi, said there is a need to checkmate the tobacco industry and compel stakeholders to play an active role in introducing measures to curb smoking in videos. In their recommendations, Akinbode said adult ratings for films should be introduced in videos with smoking scenes, as well as anti-smoking advertisements. Other recommendations are anti-smoking health warnings, certify no payoffs, stopping the identification of tobacco brands, and the total ban of tobacco product placements in movies. “CAPPA is spearheading advocacy efforts at building a critical mass to confront the industry’s tactics of wooing the young and uninformed through films and music videos. We require strong anti-smoking advertisements shown before the start of films, TV, or online programs containing Tobacco products. “Certify that no payments have been received by studios or producers for depicting tobacco use in movies and ending the onscreen depiction of actual tobacco brand,” He added that CAPPA is working with the government to make sure that smoking laws are enforced and to also make the government wake up to their responsibilities. Gospel singer, Lanre Teriba also said he will always campaign against smoking and will contribute his quota on smoke-free Nollywood. CAPPA unveiled a music video on the campaign which was put together by Adeogun Yinka (Zadok) and Ifemena Okudili (Reflex).
