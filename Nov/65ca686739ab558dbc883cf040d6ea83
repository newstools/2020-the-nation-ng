 THE World Health Organisation’s (WHO) Europe director Hans Kluge has warned that the next six months of the pandemic will be “tough” but added “there is light at the end of the tunnel”. Kluge told a news briefing that some health systems in Europe were being overwhelmed as more than 29,000 COVID-19 deaths were recorded in the past week. “Europe is once again the epicentre of the pandemic, together with the United States,” he said. “There is light at the end of the tunnel but it will be a six tough months.” Kluge, who was speaking from Copenhagen, advocated for mask use over lockdowns, as he warned about the dangers of easing lockdowns too quickly. He told reporters: “Lockdowns are avoidable; I stand by my position that lockdowns are a last resort measure. “Mask use is by no means a panacea and needs to be done in combination with other measures. However, if mask use reached 95 per cent, lockdowns would not be needed.” He said during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, community-based groups formed safe solutions of breaking their fast, which involved celebrating virtually or delivering meals to homes for “distance celebrations”, while a “virtual Diwali” involved free online events run by municipalities across Europe for “short, safe revelries”. “Cherish the festive season with those close to you,” said Dr. Kluge. “If it’s a large gathering of vulnerable people, you may postpone that gathering until you can safely gather. “Despite the cold, if local restrictions permit, gather outside with loved ones for picnics in the park.” He said signs of community spirit are being seen across Europe, with homeless shelters planning to deliver warm meals and food packages to the homeless at Christmas.
