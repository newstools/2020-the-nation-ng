 The Students’ Union President of Abia State University(ABSU), Comr. John Nwakama has appealed to the leadership of the Academic Staff Union of Universities(ASUU)  in the institution to suspend its industrial action. He  said :  “ We are not ignorant of the fact that lecturers are still owed salaries for months, but we humbly appeal that you consider us  as we don’t want to miss a whole year out of school because the impact is much. Students have   extra year, delay in seniority for Law students and delay in procession for students to attend NYSC, just to mention but a few.” The union leader also explained   that the Governor had  reassured them  that he would  pay  their  arrears upon resumption. Nwakama added that he believes if school resumes, the  internally  generated revenue  of the institution would  increase and  be channeled to payment of salaries. He also thanked the state Governor, Dr Okezie Ikpeazu for scrapping the pandemic prevention fee the institution mandated students to pay and for giving every student indigene of Abia State N30,000 each. “The SUG  and the entire students leaders of Abia State University express their profound appreciation to   Governor Ikpeazu for his timely and fatherly intervention for scrapping the pandemic fees and authorizing the payment of thirty thousand naira (N30,000) pocket money each to Abia students in our prestigious university,” he said.
