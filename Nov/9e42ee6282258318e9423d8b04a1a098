The Lagos State Security Trust Fund (LSSTF) has trained 330 officials of the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and bleeding control. The training held on Governor Road, Alausa, Ikeja, was part of the quarterly training for the RRS officials for them to save lives on the road during emergencies. LSSTF’s Executive Secretary Dr. Abdurrazaq Balogun appealed to Lagosians to continue to support the police for the officials to discharge their duties effectively. Balogun said the training was to ensure that the officials, as first responders, know the basic steps to saving lives and be able to stabilise victims before the arrival of medical teams. ”It is important for all of us to realise that the police are meant to serve us. Let us on our part support them in whichever way or manner they may require of us,” he said. RRS Commander Tunji Disu, Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), said policing is about giving service to members of the public, adding that  saving lives is part of policing.
