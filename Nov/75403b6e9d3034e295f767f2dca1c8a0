Webb Fontaine Nigeria Limited has reiterated its commitment to support government’s intention for a more modern Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) administration that will improve in revenue collection, trade facilitation and productive speed without compromising national security. The company in a statement by its Managing Director, Ope Babalola, while pledging its commitment, also dissociated itself from a suit challenging the Federal Government’s initiative on the NCS modernisation. Babalola, in the statement disclosed that the company is shocked at its name being mentioned in litigation against the federal government challenging the customs modernisation initiative. “Importantly, we want to reiterate that Webb Fontaine Nigeria Limited is not in court with the Federal Government of Nigeria . We have never engaged in litigation with any ministry, department or agency of government. We wish to once again restate our support for the Federal Government drive for modernisation of Nigeria Customs Service, which synchronises with our vision as a service provider in this line of business,” the statement read. Babalola said it is appalling that the company was mentioned in a lawsuit it knows nothing about. “We find it misleading and disruptive to our excellent relations with the Federal Government, the National Assembly, and the Nigeria Customs Service,” he submitted.
