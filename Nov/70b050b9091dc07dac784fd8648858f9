 A MIDDLE-AGE man, Olatunji Atangbayila, has raised the alarm over a threat to his life and family members by suspected herdsmen in Akure, Ondo State. Atangbayila raised the alarm at his residence in Akure, Ondo State, while conducting newsmen round his home which was destroyed by herdsmen in an attack that coincided with the recent #EndSARS protests. It would be recalled that the farmland of a former Secretary to the Federal Government, Chief Olu Falae in Ilado, Akure, a few kilometers from Atangbayila’s residence, was penultimate Sunday ravaged, for the umpteenth time by suspected herdsmen. According to Atangbayila, no fewer than ten herdsmen visited his house on September 19, 2020 when he and his family had travelled out of the state. ”They pulled down my perimeter fence, worth hundreds of thousands of naira, accusing me of blocking the way to the stream where their cattle graze and drink water”.
