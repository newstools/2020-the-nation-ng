AFTER a highly anticipated release, Juli Endee has released a new song. The Liberian culture ambassador, on November 13, 2020, launched new music entitled ‘God Wins.’ The launch of the new song is in continuation of Endee’s efforts to light up the musical world and help put Liberia on the musical map. She further said the launch of the new album aligns with her unceasing determination to recognize the goodness of God and glorify Him for his continuous blessings upon her life amid trials and tribulations. Speaking on the need for the song, Endee noted that the release of the song is not unconnected with her ability to mobilize and pull people together for a worthy national cause. “While all of several things were going on, God just started revealing things to me about how I should respond to the situation. Then the thought came to me that in the midst of all, God wins. Part of this was the fact that the volunteers were demonstrating against me instead of the institutions linked to the program.”
