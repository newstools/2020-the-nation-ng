The Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, Saturday ordered a probe into the issues concerning the posting of a photo on social media by Kannywood actress, Rahma Sadau, and ensure it does not threaten public peace. The actress, a Muslim, had posted her photographs on social media which some people considered indecent and inconsistent with Islamic norms. The post had generated a lot of heat, especially from Muslims, who called her out for the inappropriateness of the post. She was consequently banned by Kannywood, the Hausa movie industry. The actress took down the post and apologized, but one Mallam Lawal Gusau, from Kaduna State, wrote a petition to the Inspector-General of Police complaining that the post caused derogatory and blasphemous comments against Prophet Muhammed. Sequel to the petition, the IGP directed the Kaduna State Police Commissioner to ensure that “the development does not result in any act that could threaten public peace and security.” The IGP also directed the Police Commissioner to “furnish him with updates accordingly.”
