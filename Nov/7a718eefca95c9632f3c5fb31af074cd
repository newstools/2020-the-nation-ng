KENYAN marathoners swept all the medals at stake as John Muirurri Mburu and Caren Mayo won the male and female tittles of the maiden 21km Kaduna Half Marathon race and $10,000 prize money each. Phillip Taurus was second with $7,000 prize, while Josephat Kiptanui came third to cart home the $5,000 prize money. Cheptoeck Careen was the runner up in the female category winning $7,000, while Lilian Chemweno went home with $5,000 as the bronze medalist. The 29-year-old John, who said he has been running for 10 years, described the race as a good one, noting that though he trained hard for the race, Kaduna weather was equally favourable. “I have been training well for the marathon and I’m happy that I won. The Kaduna weather was good and it makes my race better.  According to Mburu, “This is my second time in Nigeria, I like running in Nigeria. I hope to come back to Kaduna next year to defend my title. Nigerian runners are improving well, very soon they will be running good times and wining too,” Mburu said. Speaking moments after winning her race, 23-year-old Caren said she is happy to extend her winning runs to Kaduna after winning the 2019 half marathon in Michigan (USA). “This is not my first victory; I won the 21km race in Michigan, USA last year. I’m happy to win the first edition of Kaduna half marathon. The weather was good, i hope to come back next year.” Emmanuel Gyang was the first Nigerian to breast the tape winning a N3 million prize, followed by Jigak Monday Auta who won N2 million and Gyang Boyi Nyango who won N1.5 million. Vera Yohanna won the female category followed by Rose Akuso and Hudung Gyang.
