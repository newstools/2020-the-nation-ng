 AS the year gradually nears an end, Phlex and Charass are set to release the visuals to their eclectic single, Confirm. Adeniyi Ariyo aka Phlex has been compelled to get a video for the song after many yearnings from fans following its release in the third quarter of the year. Phlex teamed up with videographer Patrick Elis to film the music video with locations in Lagos and Canada. The video which is set to be released in December narrates the story of a young Nigeria dreamer. The song, on which the singer yearns for bliss and blessings from God, is styled as an Afropop record, with diverse input from the talented singer from Eastern Nigeria Charass. The pair combined to deliver a people’s anthem in “Confirm.” The surprising success of the song continued with a flood of fan requests for a befitting video two years after the release of the single. In the third quarter of 2018, Phlex released his much-anticipated EP and featured several top music stars including famous rapper Reminisce and Rayvanny.
