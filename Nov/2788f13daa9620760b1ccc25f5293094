 OGUN State Government has partnered National Centre for Agricultural Mechanization (NCAM) to  establish a  SAWAH  technology-based rice demonstration farm at Igbogila, Yewa North Local Government Area (LGA) of the State where young farmers are being trained on modern rice farming. According to the National Coordinator of NCAM, Dr. Segun Ademiluyi said SAWAH technology is a new innovation from Japan that affords farmers the opportunity of growing quality rice all year-round with a minimum of four tons per hectare. He added that the technology also takes advantage of natural resources, such as rivers and swampy areas to grow rice at any season of the year instead of sinking bore-hole in the farms for irrigation. In his remarks, Commissioner for Agriculture, Adeola Odedina, described the demonstration farm as a welcome idea which keys into the agricultural agenda of Governor Dapo Abiodun, adding that rice plantation was ongoing in 10 LGAs  of the State. He said, ”This is a welcome development and it is in line with the agricultural agenda of the State. It is also in line with the vision of being one of the leading States in rice production in the country. We can grow rice in 10 Local Governments Areas, what we are known for is upland rice. So, this is our demonstration and we will expand this demonstration to cover all the local government areas.” One of the trainees, Patricia Martins, who said she has been planting rice for the past five years, claimed that she was impressed by the training at the demonstration farm because it has improved her knowledge of rice plantation.
