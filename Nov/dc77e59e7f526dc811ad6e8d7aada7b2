 THE Lagos State Police Command has begun a clampdown on suspects who looted public and private properties during the #End SARS protests. Commissioner of Police Hakeem Odumosu said the culprits were being picked up following analysis of videos that showed looting and destruction of properties in different parts of the state. He spoke on Tuesday while parading 789 suspects arrested during raids of black spots. 357 vehicles and 480 motorcycles were also impounded for allegedly violating traffic laws between November 12 and 16. Odumosu said of the initial 560 suspects arrested in connection with murder, arson, burglary and looting, 435 were prosecuted, 48 were still being investigated while 82 were released after screening. He said: “The command has re-launched its strategies to fight crime across the state and prosecute hoodlums who hijacked the #EndSARS protest. “On November 15, the command began raiding identified black spots in all the 14 Area Commands, and 798 suspects were arrested. Incriminating items recovered from them include locally-made guns and life cartridges, substances suspected to be cocaine, weed suspected to be marijuana and some items looted from the Ajah Area Command and stations that were burnt. “The suspects have been handed over to the State CID, Panti, for further investigation and possible prosecution.” The police boss added that defaulters of traffic laws would be prosecuted.
