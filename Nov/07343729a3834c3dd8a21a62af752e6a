Residents of Oko-Erin and Sawmill in Ilorin, Kwara State, are groaning as a collapsed drainage has cut them off from the rest of the metropolis. The drainage goes through the popular Sawmill garage to Mustapha Sedan Street and links the now reconstructed Oko-Erin bridge. Residents of the communities now find it difficult to access their homes due to the collapsed drainage. They attributed the damage to the floods from heavy rains and a water source from a substandard drainage system. A resident simply called Hajia lamented that the bad state of the bridge had caused hardship on the people. She said motorcycles and domestic animals had been trapped in the drainage that had displaced residents from their homes. Another resident, Sulaiman, said the situation could worsen if nothing urgent was done to address it, noting that the situation had left families devastated. The owner of a storey building near the drainage, Mrs. Ebun lsiaka, said the damaged drainage had claimed a well, which was the only source of potable water for residents She appealed to the state government to assist the inhabitants. The Chairman of Kwara State Roads Maintenance Agency (KWARMA), Alhaji Rafiu Bolakale-Oloje, described the situation as an ecological disaster that could happen anytime and anywhere. He said the agency was collaborating with the Ministry of Environment and Forestry to reconstruct the bridge and drainage system.
