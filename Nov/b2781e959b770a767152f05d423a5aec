Earlier, a Member of the House of Representatives for Shomolu Federal Constituency, Hon. Ademorin Kuye, said he is creating a Shomolu youth platform which would consist of special aides of the Minister to bring the federal government closer to the people. “There are so many graduates looking for white collar jobs where as they should be the employers of labour. The windows of opportunities are there but they do not have the information. We have given them the information and we have also rejuvenated the hope and trust in these youths,” he said. According to him, “The interactive session is to ensure that we are coming back to our youths and we have heard their cries. It is time to carry them along in everything that we do.” He said the NYIF is free money that would help the youth engage in their businesses as long as they can come along with viable business proposals. “The federal government recently approved free registration of business names majorly for youths. The youths should take advantage of the 250, 000 business names available for free,” he said. He assured that his Constituency would ensure that only serious minded youths have access to the NYIF, saying that the youths have been rigourously screened and selected. “For every youth you are seeing here today, they applied online and we have rigourously screened them to get the serious ones that are ready to make an impact for the society,” he added.
