National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Coordinator, in Anambra State, Mr. Kehinde Aremu has pledged his willingness to ensure that each corps member serving in the state will gain skills that would make them self-sufficient. He described the prosperity of corps members in the state as his greatest joy. Aremu spoke on Saturday at the permanent orientation camp, Umuawulu-Mbaukwu in Awka South local government area, during the closing ceremony of the Skills Acquisition and Entrepreneurship Development (SAED). He described the SAED training as a seeds planted in the lives of the corps members by the NYSC which needed to be nurtured into a fully grown tree. The Coordinator urged them to be in touch with their trainers, stressing that what they learned on camp was merely a foundation upon which their financial success would be built. While pledging his willingness to ensuring each corps member left the State with a skill that would make them self-sufficient, Aremu prayed the skills would turn them to job creators after their service year. The hands-on training was followed by an exhibition of various products by the corps members.
