A statement on Thursday by the Principal Staff Officer, Public Affairs, Jonah Achema said Okorie was arrested during the inward clearance of Ethiopian Airline flight 911 from Sao Paulo, Brazil, en-route Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The statement said the cocaine was carefully packed in drink sachets of pineapple and lemon flavours and concealed in a suitcase. Achema said Okorie claimed to have no knowledge of what was in the suitcase which was given to him by one Uche.
