The Senate of the University of Ibadan on Wednesday condemned the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU) and its junior staff union counterpart, the Non-Academic Staff Union (NASU), for opposing the procedure of selecting a new vice chancellor (VC). The selection of the new VC for the premier university has been marred by crises in the past weeks. While some aspirants submitted petitions against the process, SSANU and NASU opposed the procedure last week, rejecting two of the six candidates selected for the next round of interview. The unions opposed Prof. Kayode Adebowale, accusing the outgoing VC, Prof. Idowu Olayinka, of influencing the process in his favour. Adebowale is the deputy vice chancellor (Administration) of the university. The unions also opposed the candidature of a former VC of Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba, Prof. Olusegun Mimiko, who is among the six, saying he was anti-workers during his tenure at the institution owned by the Ondo State Government. But after an emergency meeting attended by 188 members at the institution’s International Conference Centre yesterday, the Senate supported the procedure, stressing that it was in line with extant laws. It said the labour unions have no role to play in the selection of a VC, according to the extant laws. In a seven-point resolution of the highest decision-making council read by a former Dean, Faculty of Law, Prof. Oluyemisi Bamgbose (SAN), on behalf of the VC, the Senate said the unions did not speak for any officer of the university. It recommended that any member of staff found guilty of working against the laid down procedure governing the university should be disciplined accordingly.
