Atlético de Madrid and Valencia CF have reached an agreement over the transfer of Geoffrey Kondogbia. The player – who was born in Nemours, France on Feb. 15, 1993 – passed his medical at the Clínica Universidad de Navarra and signed a contract until 2024. The box-to-box footballer is a strong presence in midfield and contributes defensively and offensively. He started his career at Lens, where he grew up and made his first-team debut in 2010. The midfielder played 32 Ligue 2 games in the 2011/12 season before moving to Sevilla. He became a key player for the LaLiga outfit in his first and only year in Andalusia. AS Monaco paid his buyout clause after Kondogbia won the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup and he stayed at the Ligue 1 club for two seasons – playing 64 matches and netting seven goals. His performances earned him a move to Inter Milan in 2015. After two seasons in Italy in which he played 56 times and scored twice, the midfielder joined Valencia in 2017. The 27-year-old also became a key player in the LaLiga side’s midfield and won the 2019 Copa del Rey title against Barcelona. Kondogbia played for France’s youth teams starting from the U-16s and was called up five times by the senior squad. However, he switched to the Central African Republic, his parents’ home country, in 2018. The 27-year-old has since played and captained the national team three times – netting one goal. A talented and strong midfielder joins Atlético de Madrid. His physical presence, defensive skills, and striking ability from distance make him a versatile player in the centre of the pitch.
