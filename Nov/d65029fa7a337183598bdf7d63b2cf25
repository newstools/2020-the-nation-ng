Two repentant bandit leaders namely: Sale Turwa and Muhammed Sani Maidaji, Wednesday evening, handed over 8 AK 47 and 2 AK 47 respectively to governor Aminu Bello Masari of Katsina State during a security meeting with heads of security agencies in the state The two repentant leaders were presented to the Governor by the state’s commissioner for Police, Katsina State Command, Alhaji Sanusi Buba, and his counterparts from the 17 Brigade, Katsina, Department of State Security and the Civil Defense Corps The Police commissioner had earlier told Governor Masari that it was the view and consensus of all the security chiefs in the state to request him’’ to accept the bandits’ remorse and forgive them, so as to serve as encouragement for others to follow suit’’ While describing the development as a very significant milestone in the fight against banditry and other criminalities, Governor Masari urged the security operatives not to relent, but redouble their efforts in fighting the bandits until they are completely subdued in the state He further reiterated his earlier charge to the security agencies in the state to be ruthless with the bandits terrorizing the state and the neighboring Kaduna and Zamfara states in an orgy of kidnapping for ransom, rape, arson, and cattle rustling. He said; “I’ve instructed the security operatives to deal ruthlessly with the bandits until they are rendered permanently ineffective.’’ “We are no more going to negotiate with them, but if on their volition they decide to renounce their violent criminal ways and embrace peace, we are ready to listen to them’’. “Even then, they must surrender all the arms and ammunition in their possession, otherwise they remain enemies to be dealt with accordingly, as far as we are concerned’’. “Government is always ready to receive, forgive and rehabilitate repentant bandits, as long as they surrender all the arms and ammunition in their possession, but it is not up to us to romance with them.’’ The Governor also called on those who are yet to renounce their criminal ways as well as their informers, to borrow a leaf from the two repentant commanders, assuring them that they, their families, and property will be adequately protected.
