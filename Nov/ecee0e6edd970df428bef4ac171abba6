Founder and leader of Movement for Actualization of Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB), otherwise called Biafra Independent Movement, BIM, Chief Ralph Uwazuruike has condemned the continued detention and torture of nine members detained at Obinze military facility in Imo State. He urged the Imo state Governor, Senator Hope Uzodinma to prevail on the Army Garrison Commander at Obinze to free the detained members from Thursday last week. A statement by Biafra’s Director for Information and Uwazuruike’s Personal Assistant on Media Matters, Elder Chris Mocha, Uwazuruike said his men had complied with all the processes that could lead to releasing them but none had yielded fruits. The statement partly read, “Our members were travelling from Awka, Anambra state capital to attend a meeting which Uwazuruike was presiding over the weekend when they were arrested at Mgbidi town in Oru West local government area of the state on 29th October. “We’ve complied with all the processes that could lead to releasing them including filling forms, submission of fixed addresses, confirmation that they were truly not a proscribed group, meeting the Garrison Commander, and signing a bail bond for their release, yet to no avail. “My detained members at the military facility Obinze did not engage the army personnel at Mgbidi on confrontation that warranted their arrest nor did they resort to any acts that breached the law.”
