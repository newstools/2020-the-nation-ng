In line with his resolve to represent Oriade/Obokun federal constituency in the House of Representatives in 2023, Hon Babajide Ojeniyi popularly known as Jendor has opened his campaign office in Ipetu Ijesa, Oriade South Local Government, Osun State. Ojeniyi who recently erected street sign posts across the town said the campaign office ‘’is necessary as this year is almost gone and 2023 elections is knocking. ”This is 2020, apparently we need something much more like a startup office for us to organize campaign staff and the group of people who formulate and implement the strategy of our political campaign, and we’ll extend to other council areas in coming year. ‘’ He also restated his commitment to bring his knowledge, skills and wealth of experience to bear in providing result oriented and fruitful 21st century representation to the good people of Obokun/Oriade, saying: “The challenges are immense but, I am well equipped to surmount these challenges.”   Some of the communities which include Ipetu Ijesa have suffered untold level of neglect due to the poor representation at the federal level over the years in terms of dearth of critical infrastructure, high level of illiteracy, economic stagnation, ill-trained artisan and unemployment.” He added: “Sending me to the House of Representatives will be the beginning of a much needed corrective process and change of status quo. It’s my believe that the mammoth supports I enjoy from the people of Obokun/ Oriade and APC will propel us to become game changers,  making the desired difference and bringing hope and succor to the people.”
