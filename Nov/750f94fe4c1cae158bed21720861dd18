 OPERATIVES of the Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences (Enforcement) Unit have demolished over 1,700 illegal shanties and container-shops around Fagba Railway lines, Agege area of the metropolis. Chairman of the agency, Olayinka Egbeyemi said that owners and occupants of the shanties and container-shops were served a seven-day removal order by the government based on series of complaints about criminal activities in the area. He said that after the expiration of the removal order, the government gave them 21days grace to remove their belongings and vacate the area. “These illegal shanties and containerised shops were occupied by miscreants and hoodlums who terrorised innocent citizens around Fagba, Iju-Ishaga and Pen-Cinema area, dispossessing them of their valuables, especially early in the day and late at night.” He said that investigations conducted had revealed that miscreants and hoodlums occupying the illegal shanties were responsible for the destruction of public properties and looting of shops immediately after the recent EndSARS protest around Agege,” he said.
