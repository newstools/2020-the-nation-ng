Survival Fund is a scheme in the Economic Sustainability Plan’s (ESP) drawn by the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration and coordinated by the Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo (SAN) as part of efforts to cushion the harsh effects of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic outbreak. The disclosures were contained in an updated report of the Federal Government on implementation of the Survival Fund scheme, as the ESP scheme continues to gain attention with the emergence of beneficiaries on the first set of states across the country. Confirming the report, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Office of the Vice President, Laolu Akande, said Lagos, Kano and Abia had more MSMES activities than the rest, which explains why they got slightly higher numbers of beneficiaries. The report disclosed the Steering Committee, led by the Minister of State for Industry, Trade and Investment, Amb. Mariam Katagum is working to ensure smooth implementation of the programme across the states and FCT, as focal persons are enlisted by the Project Delivery Office (PDO) to drive the operationalization of the schemes in communities within the states. “A detailed distribution procedure for the five tracks under the Survival Fund is as follows: Payroll Support – Lagos gets 25, 000 beneficiaries; Kano, 17,000; Abia, 16, 000; other states 13, 000 etc; General MSME Grants – Lagos, 3, 880; Kano, 3,280; Abia, 3,080; other states, 2,640 each “Free CAC registration – Lagos, 9,084; Kano, 8, 406; Abia, 7, 906; other states 6,606 each; Artisan & Transport Grants – 36 States and FCT , 9,009 “Guaranteed Off take Stimulus Scheme (MSMEs) – Lagos, 3,880; Kano, 3,280; Abia, 3080 and other states 12,640 each.” The report indicates that Abia, Lagos, and the Kano States were separated in the distribution of slots for beneficiaries because of their special status in the MSMEs space, having a larger concentration of small businesses in the country. “The report allays any fears of marginalisation of States in the distribution of slots for the five tracks of the Survival Fund,” the report said. On the ongoing disbursement of grants under the Artisans Track, in the first set of states, the report indicates 66% of the total number of registered potential beneficiaries are male artisans while 34% are female artisans.
