Nigerian singer and rapper, Olotu Adebayo aka BYT, has described the current Nigerian entertainment industry as being unstructured in a recent interview. Sharing his view on the industry, he said “On my take on the Nigeria music scene, I think we don’t have an industry yet and it’s what we’re all trying to build together, as far as I can see all we have is different music factories flooded around the nation and these factories need to come together to create a real sense of what is called an industry. Also I quote. ‘Not Until musicians/creatives are getting paid by Radios, TV stations and other Networking Institutions Like it is In the western world, we can’t call it an Industry’. So I’ll say kudos to everyone that has been part of the journey to creating the Nigeria music Industry”, said BYT. It has been an amazing year for the Copacetic Music act as he blessed his fans with several singles such as ‘we rise’ up, ‘Body IP’, and ‘Ballot’. BYT noted that his fans should lookout for new tunes on his forthcoming project, he revealed the title of his Extended Play (EP) as ‘Timeless Boy the EP’ adding that it’s a collaborative effort that boasts of producers like Fliptyce Beat, STG mix, Sugarbizzy, TU2Majeek and will feature musicians such as Slim Jeezy, Sugarboy and Magnito.
