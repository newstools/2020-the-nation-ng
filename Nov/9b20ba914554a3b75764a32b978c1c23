  MARADONA reportedly died at his home after suffering a cardiac arrest just two weeks after being released from hospital after treatment for a blot clot on his brain. Regarded as one of the greatest footballers of all time, El Pibe de Oro helped Argentina win the World Cup in 1986, the pinnacle of an illustrious career and scored 34 goals in 91 games. He also scored the best ever goal at a World Cup when he scored against England. In the same match he also scored the ‘Hand of God’, a goal which has gone down in history. Maradona was born on October 30, 1960 in Lanus, a surburb in the Argentine Buenos Aires and displayed football talent early, and at age eight he joined Las Cebollitas (“The Little Onions”). He signed with Argentinos Juniors at age 14 and made his first-division debut in 1976, 10 days before his 16th birthday and had spells at Boca Juniors in 1981 and Barcelona in 1982, before playing the majority of his matches for Napoli in Serie A (1984–91), where he enjoyed great success, raising the traditionally weak Naples side to the heights of Italian football. An Internet poll conducted by FIFA named Maradona the top player of the 20th century. Maradona’s career with the Argentine national team included World Cup appearances in 1982, 1986, 1990, and 1994. He did not finish the 1994 World Cup, because he tested positive for the drug ephedrine and was again suspended. Maradona also played on South American championship-winning teams in 1987 and 1989. Maradona coached Argentina to the 2010 World Cup and had spells with the United Arab Emirates club Al Wasl. His last coaching role was with Mexico’s Dorados de Sinaloa in 2018.
