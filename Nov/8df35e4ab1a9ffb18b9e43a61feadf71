UEFA are exploring changing the Euros to a one nation tournament – and that could mean Wembley losing the final. European football’s governing body has already postponed the European Championships from last summer to 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic. Now they are giving serious consideration to changing the whole format from playing in 12 nations across the whole of Europe to staging it in one country. UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin has insisted that the Euros must go ahead as it “would bring positive energy to the people” and European football’s governing body say no decision has been taken and they will continue to monitor developments in the hope it can go ahead as planned.  But a change in format would be a massive blow to England which was due to stage the Group matches for Gareth Southgate’s men at Wembley plus also the latter stages, including the final next summer. But that now looks in serious jeopardy and, even though nothing is decided, UEFA are making contingency plans especially in the light of the latest setbacks. It has been suggested that Russia could be a front runner as they staged the 2018 World Cup and has had relatively low cases but that is believed to be unlikely. Russia has also allowed limited fans back into the stadiums.
