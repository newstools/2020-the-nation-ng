 NIGER State Governor Abubakar Sani-Bello has said he spent his two weeks in isolation to beg God for forgiveness and reflect on the good and bad things he might have done in life. Speaking to reporters in Minna after a visit to the House of Assembly, the governor said his two weeks in isolation taught him a lot of things. “The two weeks in isolation have taught me a lesson; it taught me a lot. I use the two weeks to reflect on my life for the good and bad things I have done. I have begged God for forgiveness. “I also used the two weeks to reflect on what is needed in Niger State, to review the sufferings of the ordinary men and women in Niger State and how we can address it even if it is very difficult because it requires a lot of resources. I also used the two weeks to develop a plan for 2021,” the governor said. Sani-Bello stated that anyone can contract COVID-19, stressing that Coronavirus is real. “COVID-19 is real. I want to appeal to everyone to take it very seriously and do what you can to protect yourself. If you are destined to catch COVID-19, no one can stop you. But, at least, try to protect yourself.” The governor explained that he was in the Assembly on an informal visit to appreciate the lawmakers for their concern and show of support while he was in isolation. He added that he also tried to resolve some crucial matters the legislators were not comfortable with. The governor drove himself to the Assembly in the evening along with two of his friends in a Lexus car with registration number KNT 700 KX. He spent over one hour with the lawmakers in a closed-door meeting. He said that he has appealed to the legislators for the speedy passage of the 2021 budget.
