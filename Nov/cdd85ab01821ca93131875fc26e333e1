As the 2020-21 UEFA Nations League and Euro Qualifiers continue this week, GOtv Jolli subscribers are promised live coverage of these matches on SuperSport, from 12 to 15 November 2020. The Euro 2020 qualification will see Serbia host Scotland today  on SS Football (Channel 31) at the Rajko Mitic Stadium in Belgrade. Serbia will be playing this game after drawing 2-2 against 10-man Turkey, last month in the UEFA Nations League. Scotland, on the other hand, beat Czech Republic 1-0 last month in the UEFA Nations League.  On Saturday, the UEFA Nations League action gets underway as Spain visits the Netherlands for a clash against Switzerland by 8:45pm, live on SS Football (Channel 31). Spain tops Group A4 with seven points but their 13-game unbeaten competitive run ended last time with a shocking 1-0 defeat to an inexperienced Ukraine team. Switzerland are at the foot of Group A4 with two points, having recorded two impressive draws against Germany, but lost their remaining games. A defeat here would mean relegation to League B. Also on Saturday is Malta vs Andorra at 3:00pm on SS Football (Channel 31).  The Nations League continues on  Sunday with Denmark vs Iceland at 8:45pm on SS Football (Channel 31) and Czech Republic vs Israel at 8:45pm on SS Select 1(channel 34).
