A tricycle rider, Afeez Owolabi (aka Oluomo), who was brutalised by an Army officer, Captain Olurin Olofin, said the officer has paid his hospital bills. Oluomo said the matter has been settled by the leaders of the Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC). The Nation reported how the 42-year-old tricycle rider was molested last Sunday. Owolabi described the incident that transpired between the duo as unfortunate, stating that the matter has been laid to rest. “He got in touch with me through our leaders in OPC, apologised, paid my hospital bills and gave me more money for further treatment. We have resolved it,” he said. Owolabi thanked The Nation and other people that waded into the matter for the prompt resolution.
