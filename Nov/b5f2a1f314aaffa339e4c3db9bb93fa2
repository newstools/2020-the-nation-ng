The firm’s entry, Aihie Villa won the Single Residence category in Africa while Royal Residences (Eden Heights) won the Multiple Residence Category in Africa. The award-winning building, Royal Residences (Eden Heights) is a multi-residential edifice capable of meeting the needs of the city’s top executives and expatriates while offering luxury in an urban apartment setting. The residences comprise 1, 2, 3 & 4- Bedroom apartments as well as five and six Bedroom Penthouses with facilities for leisure, wellness and health in support of the residents’ lifestyle. The tower is an elegant 17-floor high rise that sits at the heart of Lagos’ highbrow cosmopolitan business district of Victoria Island Lagos. It is a new modernist addition to the Victoria Island skyline. The building is situated on a land area of approximately 3,000 square metres along Elsie Femi Pearse Street, off Adeola Odeku Road. According to the Chief Executive Officer, Anthony Aihie, the concept for Aihie Villa was inspired by traditional Nigerian architecture. “The Aihie Villa, located in Victoria Garden City, is a single family Residence for a modern working Nigerian family. The Villa is therefore a modern expression of the traditional living arrangement,”he explained, adding that these two distinguished residential projects are masterful executions of modern architectural theory worthy to be proud of. “I am delighted they have received international recognition which is, in my opinion, richly deserved,” he concluded.
