 OGUN State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun said  the State, as an industrial hub  will need  increase supply of electricity to unlock  its economic potentials and attract more investors. Abiodun who stated this at the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the State Government and a British Power Firm, Konexa, in his office at Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta, said as a leading industrial State, there was need for it to have constant power supply at all times to serve existing companies and attract new ones. The Governor said  there was a nexus between industrial development as large, medium and small scale businesses rely on power to thrive. He aded  that self sufficiency in electricity would encourage artisans to venture into small businesses which would in future boost the industrial capacity of the State. Abiodun while enumerating some of the steps taken to provide enabling business environment, noted the re-engineering of infrastructure including roads and housing, saying the State was also making headway in Agriculture, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Youth Empowerment. “We are rebuilding our roads and providing affordable housing to our people and those who would want to come and invest in our State. Currently we are embarking on the construction of 2,500 affordable houses across the State. We are also going to construct 10,000 houses that would go for between N1m to N2m. “Our State is the largest producer of rice, cassava, poultry and even fish in the country. For us to harness all these potentials, we need adequate supply of electricity as this will encourage potential investors to come and invest in our State”, the Governor explained.
