Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr has called up Paul Onuachu as a replacement for Moses Simon ahead of the 2022 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Sierra Leone. Onuachu was initially on the stand-by list but he has been drafted into the main squad following Simon’s injury. The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) said this in a statement released on the federation’s official Twitter page. Simon picked up an injury in Nantes loss to Paris Saint German on Saturday, which ruled him out of the clash against the Leone Stars next week. Nigeria takes on their West African rivals in a doubleheader AFCON qualifying match with the Super Eagles hosting the first leg at the Samuel Ogbemuedia stadium, Benin before Sierra Leone host the second leg four days later at the Siaka Stevens Stadium, Freetown. Aside from Simon, Rohr could also be without Sebastian Osigwe, who tested positive for the coronavirus last week. A win for Nigeria in both games will see the team qualify for the Nations Cup, which Cameroon is hosting.
