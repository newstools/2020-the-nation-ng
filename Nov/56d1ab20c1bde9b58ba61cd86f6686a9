Residents of Akiriboto-Oke in Aiyedaade Local Government Area of Osun State have petitioned the government and House of Assembly over invasion by armed thugs. They said the invasion followed the vacant stool of the monarch. The petition was filed by the Chairman of Akiriboto-Oke Progressive Element, Mr. Tunji Olasunkanmi, on behalf of the residents and addressed to the Special Adviser to the Governor on Chieftaincy Matters, Mr. Rasaq Adeosun and House of Assembly. Olasunkanmi said the process of selection of a monarch had not begun, adding that Ayedaade Local Government Traditional Council had approved the appointment of the Balogun of Akiriboto-Oke, Chief Julius Olutunde Adesoye, as the regent, pending the selection of a monarch. The letter said: “The people of Akiriboto-Oke, as represented by Council of Chiefs, representatives of families and distinguished indigenes of Akiriboto Oke, pledge our support to the regent, Chief Adesoye, who has been appointed by constituted authorities in Ayedaade Local Government. “A man, who is not known to us in the town, has laid siege to our town by bringing into it heavily armed thugs who carry automatic guns and deadly weapons, terrorising our people. The hoodlums go from home to home to terrorise and intimidate our people. We are conscious of the need to protect the lives and property of our people. We don’t want bloodshed in our community. “Violence is always costly. This is why we must do all we can to avoid it at all times. The people of Akiriboto-Oke decided to keep the peace in the face of confrontation and intimidation because we want peace in our state. “We request the intervention of constituted authorities such as the Police, Military, Civil Defence and DSS, to restore law and order.”
