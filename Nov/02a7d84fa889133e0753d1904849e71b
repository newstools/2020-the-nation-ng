Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) on Tuesday faulted the social media regulation. CAN vowed that it will resist any attempt by the Federal Government to regulate the social media which, according to them, has given Nigerians freedom to speak and express themselves. It expressed fears that such move could lead to negative reactions from the youths which could snowball into another round to civil unrest in Nigeria. The religious body reminded government that there are genuine users of social media who also earn their living and impact on society through the platform, thus cautioning against the negative impact it might have on such youths some of whom make ends meet through social media. President of youth wing of CAN, Apostle Nyeneime Andy, who addressed reporters in Abuja, suggested that government should jettison the idea of regulating social media, and look for alternative means of managing the 21st century youths who are used to social media. He said: “Social media is a strong platform that can be used to sharpen discussions, even though it has negative side. Millions of people make their daily living from social media, even when some people claim that it destroys. Millions of others are also learning from social media. “In fact, Facebook seems to be the strongest religion in the world. The fact that there are few negative side to it does not mean that there are no good sides. Undoubtedly, the positive side of social media outweighs the negative side.” Andy, however, condemned the shooting of unarmed people who were protesting the brutalities of the Police particularly the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) at Lekki Toll Plaza. He asked the government to ensure that the promises they made to the youths regarding the reform of the Police is fulfilled, as well as improved governance system that would be beneficial to Nigerians.
