  Universities, polytechnics and colleges of education owned by federal and state governments and located in the six states of the Northeast have met to deliberate on successful takeoff of their regional Academic Publishing Centre (APC) in the Adamawa State capital, Yola. The Academic Publishing Centre for the Northeast is domiciled at the Moddibo Adama University of Technology (MAUTECH),  from which publishing of textbooks and other activities will be linked to public tertiary institutions across the Northeast. The Academic Publishing Centre in Yola is one of seven such centres, one in each of the six geopolitical zones and Abuja, established by the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund) to function as model publishing centres in representative institutions across the country. Chairman of the Board of Trustees of TETFund, Alhaji Kashim Ibrahim-Imam, who led the TETFund management to the Board of Trustees Engagement with Beneficiary Institutions of the Northeast’s Academic Publishing Centre in Yola, said that in view of the Fund’s determination to deliver responsive intervention programmes to promote innovative approaches to learning, the Board invited all the beneficiary institutions to deliberate on the best way of operating, managing, and sustaining the centre.
