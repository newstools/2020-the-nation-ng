Former Military President Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida (IBB) and former Head of State, General Abdulsalami Abubakar, have expressed support for the formation of the Northcentral People’s Forum. They said the forum is necessary for the development of the zone. The former military leaders spoke on different occasions when members of the forum’s Board of Trustees (BoT), led by General Jeremiah Useni, visited them at their homes in Minna, the Niger State capital. At his home, Babangida said he often wondered why the Northcentral did not have any group, especially with political essence, to speak for it. He said the zone produced more votes than the combined Southwest and Southsouth regions. “I have always complained when I heard of groups from Northwest, Northeast, Southsouth and Southwest and I kept wondering where we belong, especially as God has blessed us with the quality and calibre of people in this region. I thought we were not playing our roles well. “I have taken a good look at the contributions of the zone, politically, and in terms of votes. I found out that it has more votes than both the Southwest and the Southsouth. Yet, the Southsouth makes more noise than other zones. We have what it takes to be recognised as a very important part of this country.”
