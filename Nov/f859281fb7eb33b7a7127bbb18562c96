 PIERRE-EMERICK Aubameyang scored the only goal of the game from the penalty spot as Arsenal beat hosts Manchester United 1-0 to secure its first win for 14 years in a Premier League match at Old Trafford. With both teams playing a cautious game, a foul by United’s midfielder Paul Pogba turned out to be decisive when he kicked Hector Bellerin’s foot in the United’s penalty area. Aubameyang sent goalkeeper David De Gea the wrong way with his 69th-minute spot-kick to give Arsenal the lead. Arsenal hadn’t beaten United away since an FA Cup game in 2015, part of a longstanding run of poor form for the Gunners when facing England’s biggest clubs on the road. Arsenal’s last win at Old Trafford in an EPL game was in 2006, when Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger were the managers and current United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was still playing for the club.
