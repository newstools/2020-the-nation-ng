Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto State has said that rapists and other Gender Based Violence (GBV) perpetrators don’t deserve mercy of any kind. Similarly, the governor warned traditional leaders not to involve themselves in cases of GBV but report to appropriate law enforcement for proper process. “Traditional leaders involved in dealing with such matters should desist henceforth.” Tambuwal stated in Sokoto Thursday when he received the state forum against GBV on a visit to him. He said it was disheartening and disturbing to see an elderly man defiling a minor. “Such scenario cannot be justified,” he stated. The governor stressed that violence in whatever form must be condemned and rejected by individuals, groups and government at all levels. He noted that most incidences were against the vulnerable class (women, children). Accordingly, Tambuwal pointed out that the position of rape from the religious and conventional laws has made itclear , adding that the state Penal Code has a penalty of 21 years minimum or life imprisonment without option of fine. “We passed that into law in 2019″, he stated. While assuring the forum of his administration support to the course against GBV, Tambuwal said he would ensure efforts were made to strengthen the law especially on the child rights Act, explaining that a machinery had been put in place to interface and do the needful. “Already, the state Ulamas have concluded work on that for further recommendations and action.” He commended the forum’s commitment to the laudable course against evil acts as well their support to victims of the social vices.
