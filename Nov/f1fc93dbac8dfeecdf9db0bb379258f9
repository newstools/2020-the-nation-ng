 Lagos State has restated its commitment to create the enabling platforms for the female gender to excel in sporting activities, develop healthy lifestyle and as well boost their total wellbeing. This much was stated by the Lagos State Commissioner for Youth and Social Development, Segun Dawodu during  the award ceremony of the 2020 Lagos Women Run over the weekend, even as he assured  the participants and organisers of the state’s commitment to making the marathon a world-class initiative aimed at supporting the female gender to find fulfilment and achieve purpose. “The Lagos Women Run provides an avenue for the state to support the female gender as part of our overall commitment to enhance the development of sports in Nigeria,” he said. Plateau State runner, Patience Dalyo, led from the start at Tafawa Balewa Square to Teslim Balogun Stadium; breasted the tape at 33 minutes 43.73 seconds to win the Elite Open category. This year’s edition of the 10km race saw the introduction of the virtual race, the first ever in Africa, where participants from all over the state were able to run the race on their own or as a group at their own chosen location. First Lady of Lagos State, Dr. (Mrs) Claudiana Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu completed her virtual race at the State House, Marina with her entourage.
