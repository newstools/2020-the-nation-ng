The All Progressives Congress (APC) has condemned what it described as the selfish and insensitive plot  by the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to gain political gain from national security. APC’s Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Yekini Nabena in a statement on Monday night in Abuja, described as unpatriotic the persistent criticism of efforts by President Muhammadu Buhari at addressing security by the opposition party. According to Nabena: “The All Progressives Congress (APC) will not be dragged into an exchange with the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in its plot to gain selfish and insensitive political capital from issues of national security. “As with the case of Saturday’s rescue of a kidnapped American citizen in Nigeria by U.S. special forces, combating terrorism and other emerging cross border crimes require international collaborations and assistance when necessary. “We dont expect the PDP to understand this international best practice going by its evil penchant of diverting and sharing counter-insurgency funds to its political cronies and its criminal and negligent handling of the 2014 abduction of 276 Chibok schoolgirls while claiming a grand political conspiracy against it. “Unlike previous PDP governments, the President Muhammadu Buhari-led APC government is not “sleeping on the wheel” on serious national concerns.”
