Founder of Clever Minds  Educational Foundation, Zion Oshiobugie, has clinched the coveted Hajiya Gambo Sawaba award for his immense contribution to ensuring orphans and underprivileged children get equitable access to quality education in the most rural parts of Africa. The community engagement category winner, said the CAHR Awards which took place recently, was an initiative of CSR-in-Action Advocacy, in partnership with Global Rights Nigeria. Oshiobugie, whose foundation runs a free school for over 167 orphans and underprivileged children are located in Edjeba Warri, Delta State, with plans to build more schools in other slum communities. Oshiobugie said he never knew he would become recognized one day, having begun life without hope of working as domestic staff. “I am grateful to God today. I have always maintained that awards do not motivate me to do this work of educating orphans, rather hard work and dedication to help orphans in the most rural areas motivate people to recognize me and my team.” The overjoyed Cleverminds proprietor says he’s dedicating the award to the children under his care without whom he would not have won.  Other Awards received by Oshiobugie  and CleverMinds Educational Foundation recently includes: Award for Impact on youths in Delta state by the ministry of Youth Development, Delta State, Pace Humanitarian Award for Mentoring & Educational Development, Person of the Year by Glazia and Unsung Heroes Award by the Delta state Economic summit group.
