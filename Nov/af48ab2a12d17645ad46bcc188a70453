The kidnappers, who abducted three siblings last Friday along Owo-Ifon road, have released them after allegedly collecting N2.5million ransom. It was learnt that the children spent five days in the kidnappersâ€™ den. They were travelling alongside their mother to attend a festival at Imoru in Ose Local Government when they were abducted. Their mother was released, while the kidnappers took the children away. From an initial demand of N50million ransom, the kidnappers reduced it to N2.5million. A family source confirmed the release of the children, saying they have been reunited with their families.
