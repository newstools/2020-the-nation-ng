Boxers have expressed delight at the return of GOtv Boxing Night. The 21st edition of the event has been scheduled to hold on April 12, but was postponed due to Coronavirus pandemic and lockdown subsequently imposed. The edition, which is now scheduled to hold on November 27 at the Rowe Park Sports Centre, Lagos, has thrilled most of the pugilsits. The event will be headlined by a national bantamweight title bout between Habeeb Oladeji and Tunde ‘Turning Star’ Olojede. Other bouts include a national light heavyweight challenge contest between Segun ‘Success’ Olanrewaju and Cosmos David and national super featherweight challenge between Sikiru ‘Omo Iya Eleja’ Shogbesan and Kazeem Oliwo. Speaking during an interview yesterday, Rilwan “Babyface” Babatunde, the West African Boxing Union (WABU) welterweight champion, said he is thrilled to return to action after a seven-month break.  Babatunde, who is billed to fight Jubril Olalekan in a challenge duel, said: “I can’t wait to fight again. I never stopped training even for one day, so I fully prepared for the fight,” he said. Former African Boxing Union (ABU) light welterweight champion, Olaide ‘Fijaborn’ Fijabi, who is making a ring return after two years, also said he is excited at the chance to fight again. Fijabi, who will fight Dennis Mbat, said he expects to make a triumphant ring return. “I’m happy to be back. Covid-19 disrupted my programme, but I am grateful to God that the ban on sporting activities has been lifted. Mbat will fall in three rounds,” Fijabi said. WABU lightweight champion, Rilwan “Real One” Oladosu, who has his eyes on the African title, said GOtv Boxing Night 21 has given him the opportunity to restart his bid for the continental title.
