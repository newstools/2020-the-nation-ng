Chelsea boss, Frank Lampard, wants to beat Tottenham for club owner Roman Abramovich. Lampard paid tribute to Abramovich as the Russian billionaire prepares for his 1,000th game as owner of Chelsea. “As a manager and a player who was involved in a lot of those games I can give him nothing but a huge thank you,” said Lampard, who returned last year as head coach. “Nothing we have achieved in the Roman Abramovich era could have been achieved without him or his support. “Firstly, a financial input but also the development of the training ground and also the love and time put into the academy. And the trophies we have been able to win have been made possible because of him. “We are thankful and our end of the bargain is to remain successful on the pitch. “The special message from us will be to go out and win the game. That will be the best message back to Roman for a very special landmark.” (www.sportinglife.ng)
