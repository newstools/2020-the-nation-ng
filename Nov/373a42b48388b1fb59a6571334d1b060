 THE Alara of Ilara, Oba Folarin Ogunsanwo, has proven that being a traditional ruler doesn’t affect his relationship with God and his understanding of the Holy Book. Oba Ogunsanwo, who ascended the throne of his forefathers in July 2020, recently held a thanksgiving ceremony at the Immaculate Catholic Church, Ibowon, Epe, Lagos, after ending his three months of seclusion as demanded by custom. While appreciating the people of Ilara for their support since he was declared the king, he established his mastery of the word of God. He said: “The wisdom to rule and the wisdom to do what is right shall be given by God. The Bible says that the righteousness exalts a nation but sin is a reproach. It is my prayer that righteousness of the Almighty God will reign in our homes and our town.” The king also assured that he would work hard to surpass the achievements of his predecessors and bring development to the community.
