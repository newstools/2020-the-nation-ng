An operative of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), and a member of a vigilance group have died following an attack at a residential building in Yola, the Adamawa State capital. Gunmen who stormed the residence in Mbamba, a community on the outskirts of Yola Town in Yola South Local Government Area, also reportedly abducted two PhD students of the American University of Nigeria (AUN), Yola. The incident occurred on Thursday, The Nation learnt. It was reported that the building that was attacked belonged to the state House  of Assembly Speake Iya Abbas. A report even suggested that the attackers went for the Speaker but ended up kidnapping his relatives as the speaker was not around. But chairman of the state House Committee on Information, Hon Japhet Kefas refuted this version of the report. “I want to make it clear that nothing like that happened (at the speaker’s residence). The state police command earlier confirmed the Mbamba attack but did not specify the ownership or occupants of the affected residence. Spokesman Suleiman Nguroje said on Sunday that the vigilance man died at the scene of the attack while the NSCDC official died afterwards from gunshot wounds. Confirming the death of its personnel, Adamawa Command Public Relations Officer of the NSCDC, Mansur Sajor, said the official, Solomon Joshua, died while medics battled to save him. “We understand that some gunmen went to a house to kidnap somebody. Our officer was among security operatives from different outfits drafted there under Operation Farauta. Our officer was shot during an exchange of fire with the kidnappers,” he said. The AUN said through its Vice President in charge of public relations, Prof Abbas Tahir, that the school was not in session and that it had not heard about any abduction of its students.
