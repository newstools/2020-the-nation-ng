A Federal High Court in Abuja will on Thursday hear the bail application of Borno South Senator, Ali Ndume. Ndume has been in prison custody since Monday for standing as surety for a former Chairman of the defunct Pension Reformed Task Team, Abdulrasheed Maina, believed to have jumped bail. Maina was facing charges of money laundering involving N2bn before he was granted bail. On November 18, 2020, Justice Okon Abang, revoked the bail granted Maina, ordered his arrest and directed his trial would proceed in absentia. The judge also on Monday remanded Ndume in prison until he produced Maina or paid the sum of N500m bail bond to the Federation Account. The judge, in the course of the trial in the absence of Maina, on Wednesday, acknowledged the bail application filed by Ndume’s lawyer. He said the bail application was brought to his attention at about 8.58am on Wednesday, disclosing that he had immediately directed that the matter be fixed for hearing on Thursday. He also said he had directed that hearing notice for the Thursday’s proceedings be issued and served on the parties. Although Ndume’s lawyer was not present in court, EFCC’s counsel, Mohammed Abubakar, confirmed that he had been served with the hearing notice. Details shortly…
