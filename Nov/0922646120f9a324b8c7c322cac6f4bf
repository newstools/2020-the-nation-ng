Three siblings who were kidnapped last Friday along Owo-Ifon road have regained their freedom. It was learnt that the children spent five days in the kidnappers den. It was further gathered that the sum of N2.5m ransom was allegedly paid to their abductors. They were travelling alongside their mother to attend a festival at Imoru in Ose local government area when they were abducted. Their mother was released while the kidnappers took the children away. From an initial demand of N50m ransom, the kidnappers reduced it to N2.5m. A family source confirmed the release of the children saying they have been reunited with their families. “They have been freed and we paid N2.5m before they were left off the hook. ”We appeal to the relevant security agencies to be alive to their responsibilities and save the innocent travellers from kidnappings which has taken a worrisome dimension.”
