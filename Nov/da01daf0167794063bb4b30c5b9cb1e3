  Despite the caution against distracting President Muhammadu Buhari, administration, two of his ministers are neck-deep in furthering their aspiration to occupy the Presidential Villa come 2023. The same ministers who were implicated in the plot which led to the removal of the former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, are battling for the soul of the party.

Since what matters to them is the Villa seat, it is now like Macbeth: “fair is foul, foul is fair.” Sentry will soon unveil the affected ministers.
