 The founder of Hot Ticket Productions, Blessing Amidu, has  reiterated the importance  of education and entertainment (Edutainment) for children during and after the Coronavirus pandemic. This, she said, led to the production of the first feature-length cartoon movie to enable children to  learn the country’s history which  would be released next month. “This year has been a tough one for the world. Families and students have had to deal with a global pandemic, economic challenges,  civil unrests, and educational challenges, among others. “However, the biggest form of schooling during the pandemic has been cartoon for kids. It opens up a whole new space for children to learn. “As we approach the end of the year, it is important to provide some succour and means of escape  for children and the entire family. Thus, we strongly believe that education  and entertainment are  powerful tools for learning,” she  said.  Amidu noted that the movie would be of educational value to millions of children and students. “The movie will serve as a source of joy and laughter for Nigerian families and a source of educational value to millions of students and children around the world, during the festive season and for many years to come.This took 30 incredible talents and two years of making this movie. We are truly proud of the production and are privileged to have been able to tell a great Nigerian story,” she said. Bisi Adetayo, who directed the production, said the live animation would teach young and older children about Oloibiri history and other values. She also noted that with scenes showing notable landmarks and historical places such as Oloibiri, a community in Bayelsa State, where crude oil was first discovered in commercial quantity in 1956, it was expected that parts of the movie would serve as a flashback to Nigeria’s early years while  educating children.
