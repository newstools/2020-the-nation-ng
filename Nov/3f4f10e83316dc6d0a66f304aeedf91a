An expectant mother has been killed by gunmen suspected to be kidnappers at Rigachikun, a suburb of Kaduna metropolis. A source from the area told The Nation that the woman and her husband were kidnapped and taken away from their residence late Tuesday. The woman was killed by the attackers when security operatives engaged them in a gun battle. Details of the incident were sketchy at press time, as police spokesman Muhammad Jalige was yet to respond to inquiries about the incident. A source said, “Kidnappers stormed the house of the victims and went away with them. Security operatives chased them and in the process of fire exchange the kidnappers shot the woman and she later died in hospital. “The woman was pregnant and about to give birth before the ugly incident. She has already been buried according to Islamic rites.” Yesterday, some gunmen also kidnaped a middle-age women, one Mrs. Grace Ameh, after shooting her husband in Abuja. An eyewitness, who pleaded anonymity, said the incident occurred in the wee hours of Wednesday when some armed hoodlums invaded the residence of Mr and Mrs. John Ameh around Gwagwa. Another source said, “Mrs Grace Ameh was abducted, her husband who happened to be at home with her was shot by the gunmen. However, he has been rushed to an undisclosed hospital for treatment. “We need help against these kidnappers and men of the underworld. Government should do something fast to avoid further crisis”. Police spokesman Mariam Yusuf confirmed the incident, saying that detectives were on the perpetrators’ heels.
