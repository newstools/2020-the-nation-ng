The fire outbreak at the Oando tank farm in Ijora-Badia, Apapa area of Lagos, has finally been put out more than 24 hours after it began. As earlier reported by The Nation, the tank farm owned by Oando, an energy company, and managed by OVH Energy had gone up in flames at about 12 pm on Thursday. The fire outbreak, whose cause was yet to be ascertained at press time, was said to have begun from one of the tanks in the facility which contained about 7.8 million litres of gas. According to the Director-General of the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), Dr. Oke-Osanyintolau, the fire was finally extinguished with the combined efforts of private and public emergency response teams. He said: “Following the Herculean efforts of a joint public and private emergency response team, the inferno at the Oando tank farm has finally been extinguished and the affected area cordoned off.” According to him, the volatile nature of the area made the response team to focus on preventing the spread of the fire and avoiding any secondary exposure. No death or injury was, however, reported as the staff of the company were said to have been evacuated. Oke-Osanyintolu said the state government would be conducting a joint investigation and assessment in order to implement measures aimed at preventing a reoccurrence. According to him, stakeholders from the Federal Fire Service, Lagos State Fire Service, the Nigerian Navy Fire Fighters, UBA Fire Service, Forte Oil Fire Service and officers of the Nigeria Police Force all worked to curtail the fire and prevent it from spreading to other tanks at the depot.
