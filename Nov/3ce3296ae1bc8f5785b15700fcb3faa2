The deceased, a mother of five children and six grandchildren worked with former British Paints (now Berger Paints) as a stenographer before she delved into business and unionism with her husband. Addressing newsmen, Kokori said: “She was a pillar of democracy during the struggle for the June 12 actualisation. She was holding forte for me while in prison at Bama. “She was my backbone; very supportive to my struggles like Kudirat was to Abiola. She was holding meetings with late Gani Fewehinmi, Femi Falana, Beeko Kuti, Abraham Adesanya and other chieftains of NADECO, Afenifere and civil societies, among others in my absence”. Mrs. Kokori, whose remains have been brought from Lagos and embalmed in a morgue in Delta, hails from Agbarho in Ughelli North Local Government Area. She was 73 and her burial comes up on a yet-to-be-decided date in February 2021, according to Chief Kokori.
