Youth and Sports Minister, Sunday Dare, has questioned the suitability and competences of Super Eagles Technical Adviser, Gernot Rohr, after Nigeria’s not-too-impressive home and away ties with Sierra Leone in the AFCON qualifiers. The Nigeria team was to a 4-4 draw in their first duel at the newly refurbished Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium in Benin, Edo and 0-0 outing in their second leg in Freetown. Football pundits blamed Super Eagles’ poor outings on Rohr as he could not manage the pool of talents in the Nigeria camp to turn the fortunes of the team around when the chips were down. Dare, in his Twitter handle, raised the alarm, saying Nigerian football deserves better results than what Rohr and his players gave the country last weekend. He however assured Nigerians the needful will be done by the football authorities as he apologised to all football lovers across the country for the unfortunate incident.
