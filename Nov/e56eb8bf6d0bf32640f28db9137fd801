He said: “Epilogue’ is a masterpiece, a class act. I say that with all confidence because of the amount of work that went into that, the efforts, sleepless nights. There are times I never went to bed with my girl, she went alone because I am in the studio working till 4 am in the morning and going to bed by 5 or 6. “Sometimes, I’m in the studio working and when I come out, it is already daylight. I had worked all night putting my all and all into it. I have a decade worth of experience that has come into the ‘Epilogue.’ Everything about the ‘Epilogue’ has been my story, my journey. I write about the things I go through. I don’t like writing fictional work. I write factual work. My songs are not gangster stuff, kill you, shoot you, no. My music is about my lifestyle and how I live my life like a boss. I have come from nothing and I have built a multi-million-dollar corporation with just minus $20 in my bank account. The ‘Epilogue’ is a diary of all the events that have occurred in my life for the past 10 years.” Emiantor said that his songs are solely about his life experiences and not gangster type of rap songs.
