 STOKE City coach Michael O’Neill has praised former Super Eagles’ captain John Obi Mikel for playing a key role in helping the Potters keep a clean sheet in their 1-0 win against Rotherham at the Bet365 Stadium on Saturday. O’Neill deployed a 3-4-3 formation against the Millers, with Mikel operating as one of the two central midfielders. Captaining the squad for the fourth consecutive game, Mikel exhibited his range of passing, football intelligence and protected the back four. Asked by reporters if Mikel and Jordan Thompson were important in protecting the back four, O’Neill answered : “Very important. In all honesty it’s not probably the kind of game that Jordan thrives in but John was excellent, a great presence, and Jordan was important beside him. “I thought Nick Powell was terrific as well. He was that good link between the midfield and Steven Fletcher. “We stood up to a very physical challenge and we’re delighted to get the three points.” Stoke City sit eight in the table with 15 points after nine matches in the EFL Championship.
