SUPER Eagles skipper Ahmed Musa has begged Nigerians to forgive the team’s second-half display that saw them throw away a four-goal lead in an AFCON qualifier against Sierra Leone on Friday evening. Three goals in the game’s last 20 minutes completed the Leone Stars’ incredible fight back to give the visitors a point from the encounter.  “This has been a real shocker,” the former Al Nassr forward told the Nigeria Football Federation website. “I want to, on behalf of the entire team, apologise to the generality of Nigerians for this poor result. We will go to Freetown and do the needful.” Nigeria retain the group’s top spot with seven points, despite dropping their first points of the campaign, while the Leon Stars now boast two points from their three games played.
