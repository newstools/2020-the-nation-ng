Former Anambra State Governor Peter Obi has urged journalists and other media practitioners not to be tired in their struggle for a better society, irrespective of the attacks meted out to them in their line of duty. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain noted that a vigorous media is essential for societal development. Obi’s word of encouragement was contained in his statement on the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists. The former governor noted that journalists play critical roles in every society. He also said journalists are often at the risk of attacks by authoritarian regimes and violent groups seeking to gag the media. According to him, such attacks can depress other journalists bent on advancing the cause of society through the media. Obi urged Nigerian journalists not to be discouraged by some harsh realities they face in their line of duties. The former governor advised them to continue to resist every form of media suppression and remain fair and professional in their practices. “There have been reports of attacks on journalists discharging their professional duties. Some of these attacks are often not well investigated in order to bring the perpetrators to justice. “We must form a united front against attacks on journalists, which obviously are attacks on press freedom, a vital ingredient for achieving societal development. “I encourage journalists and media practitioners to remain resolute in using their career to advance the cause of humanity,” he said. Obi advised government to ensure media freedom and security for journalists and media practitioners so as to build a better and more informed society.
