 ADAMAWA State Governor Ahmadu Fintiri on Monday presented a fiscal proposal of N140billion for 2021 to the House of Assembly. The governor last year presented N183 billion for 2020, a budget which was later reviewed down to N140 billion following revenue shortfalls caused largely by the COVID-19 pandemic. He said the 2021 budgetary proposal was his second since he was elected governor last year, adding that his administration regarded it as that of stabilising hold on governance and delivery of services. “We call it Budget of Stabilisation,” the governor said, noting that the proposal was aimed at consolidating the socio-economic development he had instituted since he was sworn in as governor in May last year. He said of the total proposal of N140,034,404,449 for 2021; N72, 817,892,910, being 52 per cent, is allocated to capital projects. Fintiri said a reasonable sum, N16 billion, would be spent on roads in rural and urban communities as well as on the two flyovers being constructed at the state capital, Yola. Speaker Aminu Iya Abbas described the 2021 fiscal proposal by Governor Fintiri as a realistic one. He said it was evident that the governor had pegged the estimate down to realisable limits. The Speaker appealed to the governor to give consideration to the welfare of teachers when dispensing the allocation for education, so that teachers would not only be well paid, but would also have their other needs serviced. A breakdown of the budget proposal in terms of allocations to the sectors is expected later.
