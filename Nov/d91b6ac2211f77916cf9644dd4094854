 A band of heavily armed bandits has been killed in airstrikes conducted by the Air Component of Operation Thunder Strike after they were spotted with flocks of sheep and cattle rustled from Dankolo and Machitta villages in Kaduna State. They were spotted by Nigerian Air Force aircraft on reconnaissance mission at Kaboru Village heading towards Kwiambana Forest, following intelligence reports. Coordinator Defence Media Operations, Major General John Enenche, in a statement, stated that “the Air Component of Operation THUNDER STRIKE has neutralised several armed bandits in the Kwiambana Forest area of Kaduna State.” According to him, “The operation, which took place on 12th November 2020, was executed sequel to reports that close to a hundred bandits carrying high calibre weapons mounted on motorcycles, had rustled a large number of cattle and other livestock from Dankolo and Machitta Villages. “The bandits and the rustled livestock were subsequently spotted by a Nigerian Air Force (NAF) aircraft on reconnaissance mission at Kaboru Village heading towards Kwiambana Forest. The Air Component therefore dispatched a NAF attack helicopter to the location which engaged the target area, leading to the neutralisation of several of the bandits.”
