 A Federal High Court in Abuja has granted request of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to freeze accounts of some 19 individuals and a firm linked with the #EndSARS protests. Sources claimed the order was granted on November 5, 2020 by Justice Ahmed Mohammed in a ruling on an application by the CBN filed on the twentieth of October 2020. The Nation could not obtain copies of the court’s order as at when filing this report. It was learnt those affected by the order include: Bolatito Racheal Oduala, Chima David Ibebunjoh, Mary Doose Kpengwa, Saadat Temitope Bibi, Bassey Victor Israel, Wisdom Busaosowo Obi, Nicholas Ikhalea Osazele, Ebere Idibie, Akintomide Lanre Yusuf, Uhuo Ezenwanyi Promise and Mosopefoluwa Odeseye. Others are Adegoke Pamilerin Yusif, Umoh Grace Ekanem, Babatunde Victor Segun, Mulu Louis Teghenan, Mary Oshifowora, Winifred Akpevweoghene Jacob, Victor Solomon, Idunu A. Williams and Gatefield Nigeria Limited. The court order directed the banks to freeze forthwith all transactions on the 20 accounts on the list annexed to the CBN’s application as Exhibit A and all other bank accounts of the defendants/respondents for a period of 180 days pending the outcome of investigation and inquiry currently being conducted by the Central Bank of Nigeria. Gatefield Nigeria Limited had earlier sued a new generation bank for allegedly blocking an account used to promote media coverage of the #EndSARS protests.
