No fewer than 30 deaths have been recorded following the mysterious disease ravaging Ute Okpu and Idumesa communities in Ika North East LGA of Delta State. The state government which last weekend raised the alarm of the death of 15 youths within the age bracket of 18 to 25 years old in the two communities suspected hemorrhagic fever, or substance abuse as the likely cause of the deaths. The Nation gathered that some of the victims vomited blood while others complained of general fatigue, headache, and feverish condition before death. A mother, Mrs. Monica Emeke who lost two of her children, (a boy 26 and girl 22) at Ute Okpu expressed worry over the rate at which death was occurring as five persons died in one day in the community. Another resident said several deaths have been recorded in neighbouring villages including Ute Erunu. Commissioner for Health, Dr. Mordi Ononye gave the assurance when he led a team of public health officials to Ute Okpu with a view to unravel the mysterious disease. Speaking at the palace of the traditional ruler of the community, Dr. Ononye said: “Delta State Government has received information on seemingly mysterious deaths in Ute Okpu and Idumesa communities of Ika North East Local Government Area of the State which prompted the Governor, His Excellency, Senator (Dr) Ifeanyi Okowa, to direct the State Ministry of Health to immediately investigate these deaths, identify the cause/causes and effect containment measures.” He called on members of the community and residents of the State to observe good hygiene as the dry season approaches by properly covering their food, cutting grasses around their surroundings, eliminate rats in their houses and continue to observe the COVID-19 safety guidelines especially handwashing with soap and running water.
