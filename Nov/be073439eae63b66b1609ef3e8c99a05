Daniel James has pledged to keep fighting for his Manchester United future after helping Wales reach the top tier of the Nations League. James has been on the periphery at United this term after making 46 appearances last season following his £15million move from Swansea in June 2019. The 23-year-old winger was linked with Leeds – the club he almost joined in January 2019 before a deadline-day move collapsed in dramatic fashion – ahead of the transfer window closing last month. But James insists his full focus is on making an impact at Old Trafford, saying: “Man United is my club and I love it there. “Whether I’m playing or not I’m proud. I’m as proud to play for Wales as I am Man United, to be there at the club. “There were times when I played a lot last season and I may not have played as much this season. “But I’m sticking in there and I will always be around it. I’ll never think different of that.”  James’ third international goal as Wales beat Finland 3-1 on Wednesday to secure promotion to the top tier of the Nations League was a stunning shot from outside the area. It was his first goal since March, when he was on target for United in a Europa League tie against Austrian outfit LASK Linz. “I feel really good at the moment,” said James, who also set up Kieffer Moore for Wales’ third goal. When I do play I give my all and I bought into everything that we wanted to do, and thankfully I got that goal and the assist. “We came into the group knowing there were going to be tough games, but we’ve defended really well and caused problems to teams going forward.” Over four years on and he is part of a side who have qualified for next summer’s delayed European Championship and are virtually guaranteed a 2022 World Cup play-off spot. He said: “It’s an honour to be part of it. After qualifying for the Euros we wanted to achieve more.
