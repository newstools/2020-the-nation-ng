The Federal Government of Nigeria is offering a coupon of 2.759 per cent as annual return to investors for a three-year bond and 1.759 per cent for a two-year bond under governmentâ€™s monthly savings bond issuance programme. The coupons showed considerable decline in returns on fixed-income securities as government and corporate takes advantage of liquidity in the system to restructure into low-cost debts. The Debt Management Office (DMO), which oversees Nigerian sovereign debt issuances, is offering its traditional two-year and three-year bonds. The two-year FGNSB due on November 11, 2022 is offering a coupon of 1.759 per cent per annum, lower than 2.453 per cent per annum of the same bond issued in October 2020.

The coupon payment dates for the bonds, which pay interest rate quarterly, are February 11, May 11, August 11 and November 11 respectively. The FGNSB was introduced in 2017 as a mass instrument for nationwide mobilisation of savings and investments. Minimum subscription to the FGNSB is usually N5,000 while the bond pays coupon or interest rate on a quarterly basis.
