 THE Nigerian national team appears to have missed out on the chance to secure Augsburg defender Felix Uduokhai, with the player named in Germany’s squad for this international window. The 23-year-old was born to a Nigerian father and a German mother in the European country, and has represented Germany at various youth levels. However, Nigeria were hopeful of convincing him to play for the Super Eagles – something he would be eligible for given his heritage. Uduokhai has been a key player for Augsburg this season, playing every minute of their Bundesliga campaign and impressing with his composure in the heart of defence. The centre-back joined Heiko Herrlich’s side permanently from Wolfsburg this season, having spent 2019-20 on loan. Uduokhai could well make his Germany debut in a friendly clash with Czech Republic on Wednesday and hope that he impresses enough to feature in the UEFA Nations League games against Ukraine and Spain, on November 14 and 17 respectively.
