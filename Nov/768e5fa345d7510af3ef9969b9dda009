 THE National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) has said no corps member presently undergoing orientation course in all the camps nationwide have tested positive to COVID-19. The NYSC said this on Sunday in a statement by the Director, Press and Public Relations, Mrs. Adenike Adeyemi, in Abuja. The NYSC was reacting to reports that eight corps members undergoing orientation exercise tested positive to the virus. “The attention of management of the National Youth Service Corps has been drawn to a media report which erroneously states that eight corps members currently undergoing Orientation Course in Bauchi State NYSC Orientation Camp tested positive to COVID-19. “Management wishes to posit that at present, no corps member undergoing orientation course in Bauchi State, or any of the orientation camps of the scheme across the nation is COVID-19 positive,” the statement said.
