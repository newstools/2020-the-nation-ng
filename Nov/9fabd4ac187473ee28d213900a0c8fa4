Chairman of the Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences (Enforcement) Unit (Taskforce) Olayinka Egbeyemi has warned the public, especially traffic offenders, against inducing officers of the agency with money. He reminded those doing so that both the giver and receiver are liable in law. He added that only the court can pronounce traffic fines and money paid into government’s purse. Egbeyemi was reacting to reports that an officer, Popoola Kayode, made sexual advances at Didi Ekanem who was arrested around Lekki-Ajah for driving against traffic. He said: “Sequel to the report, Egbeyemi investigated the matter and discovered that the vehicle (Venza APP 775 GJ) was arrested for driving against traffic around Lekki/Ajah expressway on November 18. “The investigation showed that the vehicle was impounded and brought to the agency’s car park at Alausa, Ikeja. “Team leader, DSP Popoola Kayode who is not the agency’s commander as quoted in the report, collected N100,000 via bank transfer before he released the vehicle to the owner. “Kayode and his team have been arrested and queried while they would be sent back to the Police Command for further disciplinary actions. “The agency hereby warns motorists, particularly private car owners and motorcycle operators, to desist from driving against traffic as anyone caught would be charged to the Lagos State Mobile Court for prosecution.”
