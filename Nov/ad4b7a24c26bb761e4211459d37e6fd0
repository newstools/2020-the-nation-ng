Rivers State is now at the ready to partner with companies, organizations and individuals in the promotion and development of sports in the state. This much was stated by the State’s Commissioner for Sports Boma Iyaye at the presentation of branded tracksuits to Rivers United by the chairman and proprietor of Ottasolo Football Club of Lagos, Gabriel Davids at the conference room of the Ministry of Sports in Port Harcourt, witnessed by the Permanent Secretary, Sir Honour Sirawoo, and Rivers United officials. He expressed delight over the gesture and reiterated that the Ministry of Sports was very much interested in partnerships, while pointing out that the donation from Ottasolo is a testimony of how Public and Private Partnership (PPP) can work. “Government cannot do it all alone, our youth will be able to achieve more if we all come together to give them the platform to perform. I can assure that this is a partnership of a lifetime and it will be very rewarding,” noted Iyaye with commendation to the proprietor of Ottasolo.  “I want to commend you and your team for participating in the just concluded Governor Wike Pre-Season Football Tournament; I was impressed with the appearance of Ottasolo and elated that an individual could promote football this much; and it is being professionally managed. “I will encourage you with all the assistance I can and collaborate with you in terms of exchange of players and in any other areas you deem fit. The sky will be your limit; you are taking our youth to a different level, more grease to your elbow.” On his part, Davids said he was moved to do the donation owing to the love and camaraderie showed by the sports commissioner upon his arrival in Port Harcourt.
