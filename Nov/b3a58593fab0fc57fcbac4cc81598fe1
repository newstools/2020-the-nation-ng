 COACHES of some of the clubs participating at the on-going Governor Wike Pre-Season Tournament in Port Harcourt have heaped praises on the organisers of the championships, as they described it as a good way to prepare their teams for the coming league campaign. MFM of Lagos coach, Tony Bolus, said the tournament afforded him the opportunity to access his team after losing some key players during the transfer window. According to him, his team is still work in progress and with four points from two matches, he has been able to identify some loopholes in the team which the technical crew would work on. “It’s just work in progress for us,” the coach said. “The boys were decent against Bayelsa United, it’s a gradual process. Before the end of the pre-season they should be where we expect them to be.” Similarly,  Lobi Stars coach, Kabiru Dogo, said  the championships  has afforded him to test several players amidst different formations against some solid teams like Akwa United and the rest.
