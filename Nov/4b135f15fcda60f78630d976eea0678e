 ALEX Iwobi put in a good performance for Everton as Carlo Ancelotti secured a hard-fought 3-2 away win against Fulham at the Craven Cottage on Sunday. Drafted as a right-wing-back by Carlo Ancelotti, Iwobi was instrumental to Everton’s second goal of the game as he dribbled three Fulham players down the right before James Rodriguez and Lucas Digne combined to set up Calvert-Lewin for his second of the game. Iwobi’s international teammate Ola Aina also featured for Fulham in the game along with Nigerian-born stars Tosin Adarabioyo and Ademola Lookman.

Gerard Moreno stepped up to take it and made no mistake, coolly slotting his effort into the bottom left corner of the net.
