 MIXED reactions have continued to trail  plans by the private sector Coalition Against COVID -19 (CACOVID) to spend N100 billion in rehabilitating the 44 damaged and destroyed police stations nationwide, during the EndSARs protests. Some respondents, who spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos on Sunday, lauded the initiative, while some described it as a “misplaced priority”. The private sector-led Coalition Alliance against COVID-19 on Thursday unveiled a N100 billion equipment support to retool the Nigerian Police Force over the next two years. Similarly, the Bankers Committee, in collaboration with the CACOVID, agreed to support government’s efforts in rebuilding confidence in the nation’s economy in the aftermath of the EndSARs protests. Managing Director of BIC Consulting Services Dr. Boniface Chizea, who commended the group`s kind gestures, said philanthropic gestures were second nature to some of its key members. “Of course, it is a laudable move, they have done a lot since their formation, including the construction of isolation centres and massive provisions of palliatives. “Philanthropic gestures are second nature to key members such as Elumelu, Dangote etc. That is what they have always done and been known for,” he said. Chief Executive Officer of Arvo Finance, Mr. Ayotunde Bally, advised that the funds be used to empower and educate the members of the police force for better service delivery. “In my opinion, gadgets and equipment should not be the first priority for funds allocated to the Nigerian police force. Those monies should be channelled towards improving the lives and working conditions of the police officers. A political economist and a former presidential candidate of the National Conscience Party in 2015, Chief Martin Onovo, urged Nigerians to insist on transparency in the CACOVID intervention.
