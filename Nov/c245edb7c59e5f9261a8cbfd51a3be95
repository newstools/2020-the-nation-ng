Daring armed robbers in the notorious Sakponba axis of Benin, the Edo State capital, Wednesday snatched a car belonging to a nursing mother, with the baby and grandma pushed out in the densely-populated area without any challenge. The robbery incident took place on Murtala Mohammed Way, not far from where two armed robbers were lynched and set ablazed on Tuesday. Witnesses disclosed that the criminals suddenly swooped on the car, thereby pushing out the occupants at gunpoint. As at the time of the robbery, the baby was wrapped in white shawl and placed at the back of the car, but was pushed out by a man in white native attire, while the grandma, an elderly woman, became confused, as she was dumbfounded. The nursing mother pleaded with the robbers saying that she had just been delivered of the baby, but the criminals ignored her, seized the car and sped off. Edo police Spokesman, Chidi Nwabuzor, a Superintendent of Police (SP), could not be reached as at press time.
