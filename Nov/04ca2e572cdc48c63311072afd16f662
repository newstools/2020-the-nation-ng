 THE Nigeria Professional Football League Media Officers Forum are in a state of distraught and offer our deepest sympathy to the family of Anthony Obaseki over the passing away of the comrade. Until the news of Obaseki’s demise filtered in Sunday morning, we were upbeat the veteran journalist will fight his way back from illness to sports writing, but God who decides man’s purpose and time on earth had other idea. We are indeed saddened by this irreplaceable loss, nonetheless take solace in knowing that the eassy-going and humorous colleague passionately contributed his best to the society through sport journalism. We pray God comfort the deceased’s family and his close associates in Edo State and beyond at these hours of mourning.
