Market analysts were unanimous that the sustained upswing was driven by new earnings reports by quoted companies, which in most instances dampened apprehensions over the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other disruptions on corporate performance. Investors were staking on the traditional “rule of progression” that mostly relates improvement in earnings to corresponding increase in dividend payment and capital gains during the earnings season. With steady bottom-line, most analysts expected companies in the base scenario to at least sustain previous payouts, which in many instances offer better yields than most fixed-income securities. Analysts at Afrinvest Securities said the market was “buoyed by strong earnings results”, noting that corporate earnings will continue to shape pricing in the days ahead. “In the short term, we still see scope for expansion in valuation multiples as hunt for alpha-yielding opportunities in the face of increasingly negative real returns in the fixed income market remain positive for stocks,” Cordros Securities stated. Analysts however advised investors to take positions in fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro environment remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.
