 OLEKSANDR Usyk warned Anthony Joshua ‘I’m coming for you’ after the Ukrainian moved a step closer towards a world heavyweight title fight next year with a unanimous decision victory over the brave Derek Chisora. Joshua was in attendance at Wembley’s SSE Arena Saturday night as Usyk used his superior footwork, speed and ring craft to extend his unbeaten professional record to 18 victories from as many fights. The former undisputed cruiserweight champion gave away almost 40lbs in weight and survived a testing opening couple of rounds but did enough to be given the nod by two scores of 115-113 and one of 117-112 on the judges’ scorecards. He therefore cemented his position as the mandatory challenger for the WBO title which is currently held by Joshua, who defends that belt and his IBF and WBA crowns against Kubrat Pulev next month. Joshua has agreed in principle to fight WBC heavyweight champion Tyson Fury twice in 2021, but Usyk looms large on the horizon after his points win in what was only his second fight in boxing’s blue riband division. Usyk said on Matchroom’s YouTube channel: “Anthony, how are you? I’m coming for you. I want (Joshua next).” Usyk’s status means Joshua may have to relinquish his WBO strap in order to go through with his fight against Fury. Joshua promoter Eddie Hearn said: “AJ wants to fight Usyk but his focus is on fighting Tyson Fury.”
