Diego Maradona, widely regarded as one of the greatest footballers of all time, has died at the age of 60. The Argentine FA confirmed the news in a statement on Twitter which read: “The Argentine Football Association, through its President Claudio Tapia, expresses its deepest sorrow for the death of our legend, Diego Armando Maradona. “You will always be in our hearts.” Maradona was the inspiration for Argentina’s World Cup success in Mexico in 1986, winning the Golden Ball as the tournament’s best player. Brazilian great Pele led the tributes on Twitter, writing: “What sad news. I lost a great friend and the world lost a legend. There is still much to be said, but for now, may God give strength to family members. One day, I hope we can play ball together in the sky.” Following the 1986 triumph, Maradona led his country to the final of the 1990 tournament in Italy, although his international playing career ended in shame when he failed a drugs test at the 1994 World Cup in the United States and he was notorious for a wayward lifestyle throughout his life. Maradona underwent brain surgery at the start of November and his lawyer said he would continue to be treated for alcohol dependency.
