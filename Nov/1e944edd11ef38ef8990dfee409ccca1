Southeast Governors on Sunday, had a crucial stakeholderâ€™s meeting with Rivers Governor, Nyesom Wike in Government House. Though there was no official declaration of the reason for their visit, it was gathered the meeting was in connection with the recent nefarious activities of hoodlums identified by security agencies as members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) in Oyigbo Local Government Area of the State. Ebonyi Governor Dave Umahi, was said to led other South East Governors to the meeting at the Rivers Government House. The Governors arrived at Government House, Port Harcourt on Sunday evening. Wike has declared war on members of the proscribed IPOB after they reportedly hijacked the #EndSARS protest to unleash mayhem on security formations in Oyigbo killing six soldiers and four policemen. The proscribed group was also accused of burning all the police stations in Oyigbo including an Area Command, 50 police vehicles, hospitals, and a court. The Army has launched an operation in the community to fish out members of IPOB and retrieve over 50 AK47 rifles reportedly stolen by them.
