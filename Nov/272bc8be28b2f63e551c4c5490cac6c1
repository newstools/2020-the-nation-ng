President Trump’s campaign announced on Wednesday that it will request a recount of the results in Wisconsin, where former Vice President Joe Biden is leading the president by more than 20,000 votes. The Associate Press has yet to call the race in the Badger State for Biden. “Despite ridiculous public polling used as a voter suppression tactic, Wisconsin has been a razor thin race as we always knew that it would be,” Bill Stepien, Trump’s campaign manager, said in a statement. “There have been reports of irregularities in several Wisconsin counties which raise serious doubts about the validity of the results. The President is well within the threshold to request a recount and we will immediately do so.” In Wisconsin, if a race is within 1 percentage point, the trailing candidate can force a recount. The race between Biden falls within that range. Trump again sought to cast suspicion on the vote count on Wednesday morning, baselessly claiming on Twitter that his lead “started to magically disappear as surprise ballot dumps were counted.” In reality, however, there were delays in counting the record number of mail-in ballots in several key swing states because rules enacted by Republican-controlled legislatures prevented them from being counted before Election Days. His tweet was promptly labeled “disputed” and potentially “misleading,” part of Twitter’s efforts to combat misinformation about the election. Former Vice President Joe Biden has now received more votes for president than any other candidate in U.S. election history, officially surpassing former President Barack Obama’s 2008 popular vote numbers around 8 a.m. ET on Wednesday. The 2020 election was shaping up to have the highest voter turnout since 1908, when 65 percent of eligible Americans voted, The New York Times reports. The country was on track for around 160 million votes this year, which would put the eligible turnout rate at around 67 percent.
