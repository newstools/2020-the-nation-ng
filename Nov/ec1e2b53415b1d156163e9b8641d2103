  Ahead of next Saturday’s senatorial by-election in Lagos East, a non-partisan organisation, the Electoral College Nigeria, yesterday said it will hold a debate for candidates of seven political parties vying for the senatorial seat. The senatorial district seat became vacant at the Senate following the death of Senator Bayo Osinowo in June. In a statement issued by the organisation’s Executive Director, Kunle Lawal, said the purpose of the debate was to provide a credible platform for an effective interface between candidates and the people of the senatorial district, and among the candidates themselves. Lawal further disclosed that the virtual debate will hold live on Sunday, November 29, at 3 pm on Zoom platform and other social platforms of the Electoral College. While stating that the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr. Tokunbo Abiru; his Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) counterpart, Mr. Babatunde Gbadamosi, and five other political parties have confirmed their attendance.  The College, which key function is to create a new pattern of the game in the democratic space, said it decided to conduct the engagement virtually because of the COVID-19 protocols and security concerns. The statement reads: “In its quest to improve governance, the Electoral College is hosting the Lagos East senatorial debate which would be transmitted virtually on Zoom and the College’s handles on YouTube and Facebook because of the Covid-19 and security concerns “The Electoral College has confirmation of attendance from the SDP, APC, PDP, NNPP, AA,AAC, and ADC candidates. “The key point for embarking on this groundbreaking event is not only to showcase candidates to the electorate but in the Electoral colleges’ quest to teach Politeracy ( which refers to the understanding of politics) the Electoral college Nigeria must showcase the true functions and jurisdictions office in this debate.”
