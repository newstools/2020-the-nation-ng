Thus, much is expected from the committee.” The committee’s Chairman and Solicitor General of the Federation, Dayo Apata assured that the committee would execute its mandate with utmost commitment. “I assure you that our committee will be guided by the twin principles of transparency and accountability,” Apata said.
