Former African Footballer of the Year, Emmanuel Amuneke, believes rather than relying on European standard in football, there  must be conscious efforts by the continent to mould its own standard. The former Barcelona star is miffed with the idea of countries in Africa relying solely on European-based players for their respective national team, adding that young talented players based in Africa must also be given the chance. “We have grown, we have developed, but we cannot forget that the route to success is always under construction,” Amuneke began in a frank interview with Hubsoccer.com.  He continued: “We have to develop the ones playing in the African continent; we have to see how we can emphasise more on our youth. “We have to do away with the idea that players are only ‘talented.’ we have to do see how we can build a player.” Amuneke, who made headlines on the continent with Julius Berger of Lagos and Zamalek of Egypt en route to professional career in Europe, has called for a change in the modus operandi of football administration in Africa. “What we look for in Africa is immediate results, this is the major problem,” he explained. “We cannot be European but we can create an African standard.”
