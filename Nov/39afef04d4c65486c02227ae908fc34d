 THE Federal Government has been charged to give direct revenue allocation to local governments in the country, to accelerate grassroots development and youth employment. Similarly, the Lagos State Government should stop forthwith, all taxes illegally being collected by the NURTW on roads and give them to local governments, for the maintenance of roads, provide health services and infrastructure and other needs. These were some of the resolutions adopted by a group of prominent Indigenes of Lagos State at a meeting, held in Lagos last weekend. In a communique issued and signed by Chief Alaba Williams, the Ajiroba of Lagos, Bashorun Jaiye Randle, Dr. Ade Dosunmu and Chief Adesunbo Onitiri, The Indigenes, a non-governmental organisation,  demanded among others: A law to be promulgated to provide employment opportunities for restive youths, at least 30 per cent quota in all the state’s ministries and parastatals, and all private institutions that have their headquarters in the state. Some others that attended the meeting were Chief Lai Ajayi Bembe, Prof. Abisogun Leigh, Arc Kekere Ekun, Major Kehinde Danmole (rtd), Engr Mutiu Gbajumo, Ms. Denrele Adeniran Ogunsanya, Prince Yomi Tokosi, Alhaji Muri Ashorobi, and Dr. Lai Ogunbambi, the Odofin of Lagos. The Indigenes emphasised: “We want justice and fair-play for the indigenes as a panacea to peace in the state. “We condemn strongly the ongoing compulsory acquisition of our landed property from the indigenes for public uses, only to turn around and illegally allocate them to political stooges and sold at exorbitant prices to others for private use. “We want a stop to desecration of our cultural heritage and traditional institutions,” they said. The Indigenes called on President Muhammadu Buhari to sign into law without further delay, the E-voting Bill, so as to reduce violence and snatching of ballot boxes during our elections. This they added, would make our votes count and make our elections credible, free and fair.
