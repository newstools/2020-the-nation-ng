 THE 16th edition of the Africa Movie Academy Awards, AMAA, is billed to reward the African cinema’s efforts despite trouble and difficulty in 2020. In a statement signed by AMAA founder, Ms. Peace Anyiam-Osigwe, the organisers noted that 2020 has been a compelling and interesting year with the COVID-19 pandemic; which has negatively impacted the creative and tourism sector globally. “As we come together for the 16th edition of AMAA, it is to reward African cinema, and to embrace the fact that we have been working even in these troubling and difficult times,” Anyiam-Osigwe said. Continuing, she said, “This year, due to the pandemic, there have been delays and date changes because we have been hoping for the world to open up so we can congregate physically for the AMAAs. “Film making and awards are about team and networking, rooms filled with happiness, laughter, wine, dances, and jubilations, for the year’s hard work. “Unfortunately, COVID-19 has made it impossible, as the world goes through the second wave of lockdowns and Nigeria still recovering from the aftershock of the #EndSARS dilemma—where youths were demanding for the rejuvenation of the values of togetherness, a better police force, better Nigeria and Africa,” the statement reads. As nominations for the Awards are released, the award ceremony has been billed for December 20. AMAA also announced Steve Ayorinde as President of the Jury for the year 2020 honours. Ayorinde has been the Chairman of the Governing Council for AMAA for over ten years, a pioneer member of the Academy, who has been with the Academy for sixteen years.
