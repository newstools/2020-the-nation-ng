Kid comedian, Emmanuella, has put a smile on her mother’s face after she built a befitting house for her. The 10-year-old comedian who is renowned for her role in Mark Angel Comedy’s web series, took to her Instagram page on Saturday to share pictures of herself within the newly constructed building alongside family members. She said, “I built this for u mom. For all the prayers, all the encouragement, and support. Mummy I know you said u want a portable house and this is it.” Adding; “But forgive me because I must complete ur mansion for you next year. Don’t worry it won’t make us go to hell, My super Christmas mummy. I love you.” The little Emmanuella started comedy when she was five. It was gathered that she was on a family holiday when she met Angel, who needed children for his comedy shoot, and enlisted those he knew for an audition. Since then, the kid comedian has been on the rise and has become a household name.
