Osun Governor Adegboyega Oyetola has banned sales and distribution of school uniforms by authorities to pupils across the state. He also declared the reversal to old uniform policy will take effect from the new 2020/2021 academic session. Oyetola, through the Information and Civic Orientation Commissioner, Mrs. Funke Egbemode, explained the directive of banning authorities from selling or distributing uniforms to pupils was arrived at during the State Executive Council meeting on Monday. She said: “The Government of Osun state has warned authorities of schools not to sell or distribute uniforms to students in their domain as part of the protocols of the reversal to old uniforms with effect from the new 2020/2021 academic session. “The government had earlier announced, as part of the review of some extent education policies in the State, that every school should return to its old established and recognised public uniform with effect from the new academic session, as against the current single uniform regime in the State. “Uniforms are to be purchased in the open market from textile dealers in the State and should be also produced by tailors in the State. “The Council decided that no school authority or principal is allowed to assume the duty of selling or distributing uniforms to students. It is not the monopoly or exclusive preserve of any school or individual to do so. “The Council has established this commerce-driven guideline to provide an avenue for businesses within the State to receive a boost during this period. “The government expects schools to revert to their traditional uniforms at the resumption of the 2020/2021 academic session on Monday, November 16, 2020. “To accommodate any form of logistical setbacks, the government also approved a two-week window for the full implementation of the reversal, which means that by Tuesday, December 1, 2020, the reversal should have been fully implemented.”
