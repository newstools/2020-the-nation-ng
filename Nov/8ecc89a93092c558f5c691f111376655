In commemoration of the 2020 World Toilet Day, Harpic, Nigeria’s leading toilet cleaning brand from Reckitt Benckiser (RB), has partnered with the Lagos State Ministry of Environment and Water Resources to upgrade and refurbish 47 public toilet units for six communities in Lagos. The donation was done alongside the flag-off of the ‘Clean Lagos: Use the Toilet’ campaign on November 19. The newly refurbished public toilets are located at Oshodi, Ojota, New Garage, Apapa, Costain, and Leventis in Victoria Island. Country Manager, RB Hygiene West Africa, Mr Asif Hashimi, reiterated Harpic’s commitment to changing the stories surrounding open defecation and toilet sanitation in Lagos, and Nigeria.
