The Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC) has accused the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) of failing to remit over $21 billion revenue from the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas to the Federations Account. In a report submitted to the House of Representatives Committee on Public Accounts, the Commission said the money was dividends paid into the NLNG dividend account, which the NNPC spent without remitting the same to government coffers. However, members of the House Committee on Public Accounts are not happy the Group Managing Director of the NNPC, Mele Kyari, failed to appear before it to clear the air on the withdrawal of the money. Chairman, House Committee on Public Accounts, Hon. Wole Oke and other members observed the needs of the NNPC Group Managing Director and other relevant agencies to cause appearance before the Committee to clean the matter immediately, noting they hold all Nigerians the duty of care. The Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC) asked the House to investigate the illegal withdrawals from the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) Dividends account by the management of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. According to the document, “from $21.686 billion revenue that accrued into the NLNG dividend account from 1999 to 2020, NNPC expended $20,300,772,850 from the account leaving a credit balance of $1,384,875,073.39 as at 30th June 2020.” The report stated “$100 billion was generated by NLNG in sales revenue since inception.
