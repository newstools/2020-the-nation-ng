 GROUP Managing Director, Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mele Kyari on Thursday told the House of Representatives that the firm decided to shut down all its refineries as pipeline vandals, thieves and weakness of the pipelines are frustrating supply of crude to the facilities. Kyari who was answering questions from members of the House when he appeared before the joint House Committees on Petroleum Resources (Upstream, Downstream and Gas) to defend the corporation’s budget also said all pipelines supplying commodities to the depots across the country have been shut due to security reasons. He said: “As I speak to you, we deliberately shut down all the refineries – all the three – because it does not make any further sense to continue to operate them for two reasons. We are unable to supply crude oil to the refineries. “Except the Escravos-Warri line which we managed to sustain through this contracting process that we have, and Bonny-Port Harcourt refinery, it is practically impossible to run these pipelines at their optimum capacity. “The lines, as a results of the acts of vandals and thieves of all sorts, anytime we attempt to pump more than 110000bpd into the Escravos-Warri line, the line gives up. Therefore, you cannot practically operate Kaduna and Warri refineries with the current structure of the pipelines.” Kyari said he came into office with a clear agenda with a “promised that this company will undergo a transition. It will be transformed under a very simple strategy. We will be transparent to our shareholders; we will be accountable to our shareholders and we will transit this company through absolute and best practice, so that we can perform excellent and deliver to the Nigerian people”. He said for the first time in several years, the NNPC published its audited financial statements for 2018 and 2019, saying “this has never happened in the history of the company”.
