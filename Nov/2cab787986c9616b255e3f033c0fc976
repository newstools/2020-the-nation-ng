British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Saturday announced a second stay-at-home lockdown across England, adding the nation had no choice but to be “humble” in the face of the Coronavirus pandemic. Some observers have noted that Johnson’s words echo a statement by founder of the Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN) Prophet T.B Joshua on the eve of 2020. Joshua had declared 2020 to be “the year of humility”, stressing that God would “humble us with our challenges”. “This year will be a year of humility. This year, the Lord will humble us with our challenges. Challenges can be affliction.… Let us move closer to God,” he stated on December 28, 2019 after an extensive time of prayer at an undisclosed ‘prayer mountain’. Nine years earlier on October 16th 2011, Joshua prophesied about a looming crisis that would bring every nation “to their knees.” “Everyone will be humbled,” he said. “There is something God wants to achieve concerning this – God wants to achieve humility to the core. He wants everyone to be on their knees, every nation to be on their knees. After that, the solution will come.” The idea of humility has equally been echoed in recent months by prominent figures such as Dr Robert Redfield, Director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA Chief Justice John Roberts and Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organisation (WHO). “If this virus is teaching us anything, it’s humility. Time for humility,” Ghebreyesus said whilst addressing the World Health Assembly. Johnson’s announcement came as Britain passed the grim milestone of over one million infections.
