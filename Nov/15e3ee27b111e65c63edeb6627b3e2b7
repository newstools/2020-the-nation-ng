 WHEN it comes to the world of marketing communications, Kikelomo Atanda-Owo, is no push over. The elegant Managing Director of Z-Edge Limited turned a year older recently and she celebrated it in a big way. Top personalities such as Charly Boy, Yeni Kuti, Seye Kehinde, Seun Oloketuyi and Otunba Sesan Rufai partied with Atande-Owo at her residence in Magodo, Lagos. Apart from the abundance of food and assorted drinks, it was also an opportunity for some guests to catch up with friends and associates who they had not seen in a while due to the COVID-19 lockdown. Before founding Z-Edge Limited, Kike served as Senior Vice President at Peculiar People Management (PPM) and sat on the project committee for the seventh Economic Summit Lagos (Ehingbeti) in 2012 and 2013.
