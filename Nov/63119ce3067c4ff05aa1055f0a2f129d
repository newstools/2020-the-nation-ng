TOTTENHAM forward Heung-min Son has been forced to quarantine while on international duty after four members of the South Korea camp tested positive for coronavirus. Son is not one of the four to have tested positive but is now self-isolating in his hotel room as the rest of the squad await further test results. Those results will determine whether or not South Korea’s game against Mexico, set to take place on Saturday night in Austria, will go ahead.  The Korea Football Association confirmed that Son’s teammates: Lee Dong-jun, Kwon Chang-hoon and Hwang In-beom, goalkeeper Jo Hyeon-woo and an unidentified member of staff had tested positive for Covid-19. A number of international camps have been hit by positive tests during this break. Liverpool star Mohamed Salah has tested positive while away with Egypt after attending his brother’s wedding in his home country.
