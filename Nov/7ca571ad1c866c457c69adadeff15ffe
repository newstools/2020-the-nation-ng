Abia State police command said that it has arrested a septuagenarian including twenty other suspects for reportedly being involved in the killings, looting, and burning of both government and private properties which followed the #EndSARS protest in Aba, and Umuahia, the state capital respectively. Addressing Journalists in Umuahia before parading the suspects, the state commissioner of police, Mrs. Janet Agbede disclosed that the protesters, who were alleged to have killed two policemen in the state during the protests, beheaded and burnt one of them to ashes. Agbede equally disclosed that while the military and police repelled the hoodlums from attacking the Umuahia Correctional Service Centre, they looted and burnt a building housing the Dragon Squad; a unit of the police at old Zone 6 Annex at Ogbor Hill, off the Aba city center. Abia State Police Boss giving a further breakdown of what was destroyed in the state during the protests said five banks, a High Court, one Magistrate Court and Aba Town Hall and the church inside it were touched. Also listed among the places that was destroyed were the Abia State Fire service building at Aba, 102 government and private-owned vehicles, street lights in Aba and Umuahia as well as the dislodging of traders at Onions, Yam and Water Melon Markets in Aba. Agbede said one FNC rifle with 12 rounds of live ammunition was recovered from the home of the 70-year old man whom she gave his name as Umunna Eze. The CP who debunked the rumour that Fulaniâ€™s were grouping for an attack on Abians, gave other looters one week to return whatever they looted or face the wrath of the Law.
