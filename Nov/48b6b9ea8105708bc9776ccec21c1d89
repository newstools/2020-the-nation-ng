 SOUTH EAST Young Progressive Forum of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has declared support for moves by the Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi, to dump the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) for the APC. Umahi reportedly told PDP leaders at a meeting, in Abuja, on Tuesday, that he was leaving the party because of its refusal to zone the 2023 presidential ticket to the South East. The National Convener of the Group, Comrade Paschal Candle, described Umahi’s move as legitimate and timely, saying the governor has the total support of the progressive youths of APC in South East. In a statement on Saturday, Pascal maintained that 2023 Presidency should be for Southern part of Nigeria and should be for East, insisting that the group needed a Nigerian President of Igbo extraction. He urged all other relevant stakeholders in the Nigeria Project to support the South East. The statement read, “Presidency for 2023 of Igbo extraction is a collective aspiration of all, both home and in diaspora. We urge our political class to avoid this pull him Down syndrome and if it is not me, it will not be anyone else. “We urge other sons and daughters of South East to emulate Governor Dave Umahi and make a categorical statement on 2023 Presidency. We will achieve this with love and unity, not by threat. We urge Nigerians to give Ndigbo a chance to make a difference. “The North, through President Buhari, will enjoy uninterrupted eighth years tenure till 2023, and definitely with fairness and equity, the President will surely hand over to a Nigeria from Southeastern part of the country. “It is our prayer as members of APC that Mr. President will hand over to a Nigerian from Igbo stock as the only Southern zone yet to take a shot at the Presidency since 1999. “We urge our leaders mostly those in APC from South-East to re-strategise for 2023. Our leaders should start now to consult, interact and negotiate with other parts of Nigeria on why they should support South East this time.”
