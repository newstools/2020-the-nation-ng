 THE Coalition for A Better Nigeria has praised Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s decision to repeal pension for the  ex-governors and their deputies. In a statement by its National Coordinator, Awa Bamiji, it described Sanwo-Olu’s proposal as the “dawn of a new era.” Sanwo-Olu announced the plan on November 9, while presenting next year’s budget to the Lagos State House of Assembly at Ikeja. He pledged to repeal the Public Office Holder (Payment of Pension Law 2007), which makes provision for the payment of pension and other entitlements to former elected governors and their deputies. Bamiji said: “Congratulations to all Nigerians because it’s dawn of a new era in our democratic experience that we could wake up to read the good news of intention of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State to repeal the Public Office Holder (Payment of pension Law 2007) which provides for payment of pension and other entitlements to former Governors and their Deputies in the state. “The abolition will reduce the cost of governance, signal selflessness and eradicate all forms of negative comment associated with the pension law. “The Federal High Court sitting in Lagos had stopped such payment across all states in December 2019 and directed the Attorney-General of the Federation, Mallam Abubakar Malami, to review the pension laws of various States. “It is highly commendable that Zamfara State House of Assembly had complied with the court ruling.” The Coalition advised other states and the Federal Government to “immediately toe this path of honour, which in turn, will build public confidence in the nation’s administration.” He urged the president, vice president, senate president, speakers in both the national and state assemblies, governors and their deputies, to make “an appreciable sacrifice…by cutting your salaries and allowances. “This is the only way; it would be a fair play with an assurance that all of you in power don’t rub Peter to pay Paul.”
