 SOME armed persons suspected to be cult members have invaded the office of telecom giant MTN along DSP Alamieyeseigha Way in Yenagoa, the Bayelsa State capital, killing a customer alleged to be a rival cult member. The murdered customer, identified as Victor Abasi, 28, is said to be an indigene of Ogu town in Yenagoa Local Government Area of the state. It was learnt that the deceased was on the wanted list of a rival cult group, Greenlanders, over his alleged involvement in a bloody clash in Swali area of the state capital early in the year. An eyewitness said the deceased had almost finished with his documentation on SIM card validation at the MTN office when the cultists invaded the office and chased after him. The source said: “We noticed armed boys invade the MTN office and we took to our heels. The deceased jumped out and scaled the fence. But the cultists went after him and descended on him with different dangerous weapons. “We later learnt that the deceased was a suspected member of a group known as Bobos.” The killing of Victor Abasi has snowballed into a gun battle between the Greenlanders and Bobos in Amarata, Ekeki, Swali and other areas of Yenagoa metropolis. A resident of Imgbi Road, who pleaded anonymity, claimed that armed Bobos invaded the area on Monday night in search of rival groups. The source said: “They said some cult groups killed their ‘senior man’ and they are out to retaliate.” Police spokesman Asinim Butswat said the incident had not been reported to the police.
