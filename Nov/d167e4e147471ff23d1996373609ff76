The Lagos State Commissioner for Local Government and Community Affairs Dr Wale Ahmed has inaugurated 10 roads and chairman’s office in Isolo Local Council Development Area (LCDA). Ahmed hailed the council chief for implementing people-oriented projects. He urged residents to own the project. Isolo LCDA Chairman Shamsudeen Olaleye said the road projects were spread across various wards. The council, he said, has also rehabilitated some Primary Health Care (PHC) centres to improve the health delivery. “We have just rehabilitated Okeogbere PHC; we are moving down to Apena PHC but right now we are working on the Ilasamaja, which is the flagship PHC. We work more on road construction and rehabilitation because it is the common denominator,” he said.
