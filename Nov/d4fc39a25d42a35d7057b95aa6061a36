The President of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Mr. Chris Iziguzo, has called on the Kogi State Police Command to unmask those behind the shooting of Emmanuel Adeyemi, the state correspondent of the Sun newspaper. Adeyemi was shot on Monday, October 26, right at the entrance of the NUJ secretariat, in Lokoja, by yet-to-be identified gunmen who rode in an unmarked Toyota Sienna vehicle. Iziguzo made the call during the grand finale of 2020 Press Week of the NUJ Kogi State, in Lokoja, where he condemned the shooting, killing and intimidation of journalists. He described such acts as unholy and unacceptable, and must never be swept under the carpet. He urged the police to be alive to their responsibilities and address the lingering state of insecurity. Condemning the trend, more so that it is happening under the current dispensation, he asserted that democracy cannot thrive without a free press. He advised against any form of clampdown on the media, saying such would be counterproductive and constitute a threat to the survival of our nascent democracy.
