 It is no longer news that Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State accused his estranged friend, Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State of defecting from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to APC for personal reasons. None of the two actors is yet to clarify the mysterious personal reasons. It is incontrovertible that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) in 2016 traced N400 million poll bribe cash to the accounts of some firms and a charity organization allegedly linked to the governor. The accounts are those of Osborn La-Palm Royal Resort Ltd and Brass Engineering & Construction Nig. Ltd and David Umahi Faith Foundation. But only N90 million has been refunded out of the N400 million. The aspect of the water-tight probe, which has been giving Umahi goose pimples was the implication of two of his brothers in the deal. Maybe, the investigation shadows had been haunting Umahi despite the fact that he is innocent until proven guilty.
