Cross River chapter of the APC where Eta hails from on Sunday distanced itself from the legal action filed against the Gov. Buni- led CECPC. The party, in a statement jointly signed by its chairman, Sen. Mathew T. Mbu and Minister of State for Power, Prince Jedy Agba dissociated the chapter from the action. APC National Vice Chairman, South South in Comrade Adams Oshiomhole’s dissolved National Working Committee (NWC), Ntufam Eta, filed a suit on Friday Abuja Federal High Court seeking dissolution of the party’s Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) and reinstatement of the June 25 dissolved NWC. He said the action was to validate his mandate given by the statutory organs of the party. It argued that Eta neither brought to their notice any misgiving, “nor did he avail himself of the internal mechanisms of resolving issues. Consequently, the Cross River State APC condemns and dissociates itself from Hillard Eta’s purported legal action against Gov. Mai Mala Buni and other members of the CECPC. “We state without hesitation that Eta’s action is capable of jeopardizing the remarkable gains recorded by the party since the inauguration of the CECPC. “We hereby warn Ntufam Eta and his co-travellers as well as co-conspirators to retrace their steps and avoid being used by fifth columnists as agents of destabilisation. “The Cross River State chapter views Eta’s action as an embarrassment to the party because the entire leaders and members of APC in Cross River State are fully in support of the leadership of the Gov. Buni-led CECPC. “We have also endorsed the reconciliatory and peace moves of the Caretaker Committee. We acknowledge the restoration of peace and discipline in the party which has resulted in the resolution of crisis in some state chapters.”
