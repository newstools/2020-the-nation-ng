Operatives of the Nigeria Police in the Adamawa State Command have recovered seven cars from two suspected kidnappers. The command which arrested the suspects and recovered one vehicle earlier in the week has since recovered six more vehicles, the police said on Thursday. The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Suleiman Nguroje, who gave the update to newsmen in Yola Thursday afternoon, said the diligent investigation led to the fresh recoveries a couple of days after the suspects were arrested. He said the two suspects, Aminu Jika (36) and Muhammad Umar (32) who are all residents of Mubi, a major commercial centre North of the state, had recently abducted an 11-year-old boy in Girei, near the state capital, Yola, and collected N5 million as ransom. Nguroje added that following a directive from the state Commissioner of Police Olugbenga Adeyanju, the police swung into action, apprehended the culprits, and made the initial recovery of a Toyota Hilux. “After that initial success, the police, following further investigations, has recovered six more vehicles,” Nguroje said. He explained that the six vehicles were bought by the kidnappers using the ransom obtained from victims. “We have apprehended one suspect in addition to the first two and we expect to have other accomplices as our investigation progresses,” he said.
