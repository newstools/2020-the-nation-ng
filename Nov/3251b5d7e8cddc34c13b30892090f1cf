Akwa Ibom State has promised amnesty for repentant cultists terrorising Inen community in OrukAnam Local Government Area. The Chief Judge, Justice Godwin Abraham, stated this at the weekend when he visited displaced victims of cult clashes taking refuge at Ikot Ibritam, headquarters of the council. Items donated include garri, rice, beans, noodles and vegetable oil. Justice Abraham, who hails from Inen, appealed to the warring groups to embrace peace as government was ready to talk with them. He said: “The young men calling themselves cultists are not doing themselves any good, not even to the community. Some have died as a result of this unfortunate incident while others have fled from their homes to take refuge here. “Children have not attended school; many economic activities are not going on. I appeal to them to drop their arms and embrace peace.” Abraham assured the displaced persons that their plight would be communicated to government for necessary action. “The governor loves peace. The moment they accept peace, this government would care for and rehabilitate them. There are legitimate ways of doing things. I am also trusting God that all the young men involved in cultism and terrorising their community will accept peace and allow government to take care of them.” Paramount Ruler of OrukAnam Akuku Obosi lamented that activities of cultist have created fear and insecurity in the community. He reiterated Governor Udom Emmanuel’s capacity to ensure peace so that residents can return home. “We appreciate Justice Abraham for visiting the camp to see things for himself and report same to government. Anytime our governor would visit this camp, we would take him to the affected community. I believe the government would rescue us from the hands of these cultists,” he said.
