Farmers in Borno State have appealed to the Federal government to take proactive security measures that will put an end to the continuous attacks on farmers in the state. The farmers, who said the attacks have made life unbearable for them, said the crime must not be left unaddressed. In a statement signed on their behalf by Managing Director Wal-Wanne Group, Dr Abiso Kabir, on Sunday on the death of 43 rice farmers killed by Boko Haram terrorists at the weekend, they said the sad incident would not only cause instability in the zone but would also lead to poverty and make residents over dependent on aid. Abiso, who explained that Koila Agro Allied Nigeria Limited is the most affected company which lost its farmers to the attack, called on the Federal Government to recruit more persons into the civilian joint task force to put an end to insecurity. According to him: “About 43 have been buried but we are not sure these are the exact numbers that are dead because some people are still missing. “We are tired of the situation, just when we thought we have gotten our farmlands back to support agricultural development and fight hunger in the country, we keep waking up to sad events. “We can’t continue to go out to our farmlands and risk being killed by the insurgents,” he said. He however said the government should also establish series of measures to enhance public confidence in the security and intelligence agencies. “We may be facing a severe food security crisis due to the destructive activities of bandits who are not only destroying farms but also killing farmers,” he said.
