It is almost certain that Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State will dump the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the All Progressives Congress (APC). It is also a fact, barring unforeseen developments, that the two-term governor will be moving into his new home with almost the entire structure of the PDP in the state. Save for a few notable chieftains of the PDP who, Sentry gathered have told the governor and his allies in clear terms they will not join the defection train, the entire leadership of the party in the state, more than half of its members holding elective positions, as well as almost all appointees are set to go with Umahi. While the feat appears a great show of the governor’s hold on the politics of the state, observers are worried about what would happen when the governor finally marries the PDP and APC chapters in the state. How will the two parties, known for their caustic and volatile relationship over the years, stay together under one roof? Not a few are waiting to see how Umahi manages the ‘new troubles’ that are sure to emanate from the solemnization of erstwhile foes. But Sentry learnt he has been assuring everybody that what is on ground is enough to share. Similarly, APC leader, former Senate Committee Chairman on Works, Chief Julius Ucha has said the coming political marriage will be well-managed to avoid any crisis.
