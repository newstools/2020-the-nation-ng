A former Director-General, Nigerian Institute of International Affairs (NIIA), Prof. Bola Akinterinwa, in an interview with The Nation, said Trump would lose “gallantly in the popular and electoral college votes”.  According to him, Trump has been operating as a businessman and not as a statesman since he took over from Obama. Akinterinwa noted that American voters were shortsighted when they elected Trump in the last election. To him, American voters are expected to be wiser now, knowing he is not a statesman. He contended that with the way Trump had handled state affairs, especially the COVID-19 pandemic, he is expected to lose the two levels of the election. He also noted that Trump had through his actions and utterances showed that “he is not a friend of developing countries”.
