Rangers’ midfielder Joe Aribo believes his pace coupled with youthful energy would come to fore when the Super Eagles take on Leone Stars of Sierra Leone today in the AFCON 2021 qualifiers. Aribo will be making his fifth appearance for the Eagles and is eagerly looking forward to increasing his goal tally having netted two goals in the four outings for the coach Gernot Rohr-tutored side. “I just want to play my normal game and I hope to bring energy to the team and ensure I play faster against our opponent to be able to win the game. Hopefully my aim is that I want to score goals in every game I play. But I want to go all out for the team to get the result,” he said. Excited with the support the team has been getting in Benin City, Aribo believes the team is motivated to compensate the support with a win over the visitors. “I am really enjoying here in Benin and it is very overwhelming to see that the fans are here with us in Benin and their support.”
