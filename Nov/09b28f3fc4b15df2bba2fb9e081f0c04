The Federal Government has been urged to accelerate the ongoing police reform to guarantee the security of the country.  Addressing a news conference in Lagos, the President of Nigeria Youth Initiative (NYI), Mr. Olukayode Ishola, said the youth group supported the #Endsars protest, but frowned at the looting and destruction of properties by hoodlums. He said the speedy manner in which President Muhammadu Buhari and the Federal Government accepted and granted the #5for5 demands of the young people during the protest was commendable, adding that the total reform of the police force would enhance the overall well-being of the country. Praising the state governments for their dexterity and promptness in managing the situation in their states, the group called for peace, calm and restoration of law and order across the country.  ” We will also like to hail the state governments that have already set up their judicial panels of inquiry as part of the demands of Endsars protest,” Funsho Oduntan, the national coordinator, said: ” We urge the youth to channel their voting right to vote in a better leader in the 2023 general election, as youths constitute more than 67 per cent of the population. “I want to assure the government that hoodlums don’t represent the good youth of our great country. I am pleading with government, both state and federal, to empower the youth in their communities.”
