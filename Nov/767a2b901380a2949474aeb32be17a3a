A six-year-old girl’s lifeless body has been found at a burial ground in Kurmi Mashi area of Kaduna metropolis. The girl identified as Aisha Ya’u was suspected to have been raped to death. The incident happened barely four months after another six-year-old girl, suspected to have been defiled and died in the process, was found in a mosque in the same community. It was gathered that after returning from Islamiyya on Sunday around 11 am, the girl went to play in the neighbourhood until a few hours later when her mother discovered that she was missing. “The search for the girl began and she was found dead at a burial ground in the area by a farmer with sand all over her body,” a source said. Efforts to speak with the mother of the victim, Amaratu Ya’u, failed because she was still in shock. But a source close to the family said Aisha’s mother raised the alarm over her missing daughter. Neighbours soon joined her in the search. Reacting, Commissioner, Ministry of Human Services and Social Development, Hafsat Muhammad-Baba, who expressed sadness over the development called on the Commissioner of Police in the State, Muri Umar, to deploy all resources to apprehend the perpetrators of the crime happening repeatedly in the same community. “Right-thinking Kaduna people are very sad about this unfortunate development.
