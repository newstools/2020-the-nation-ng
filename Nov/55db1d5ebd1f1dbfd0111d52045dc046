Substitute Edinson Cavani inspired Manchester United to a stunning victory against Southampton at St Mary’s Stadium. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side were in trouble at the break after set-piece specialist James Ward-Prowse set up Jan Bednarek’s opening header and then scored direct from a free-kick. But Cavani’s second-half presence made all the difference, first presenting Bruno Fernandes with the chance to pull one back and then heading home from a deflected Fernandes shot shortly afterwards. In stoppage time the Uruguayan buried a trademark header to complete the comeback and maintain United’s 100% record on the road.
