Barcelona will be looking to win in La Liga for the first time in over a month when they welcome Real Betis to Camp Nou this  afternoon. Ronald Koeman’s side have made a disappointing start to the season, picking up just eight points from six matches to sit 12th in the table, while Betis are currently seventh in Spain’s top flight. Two wins, two draws and two defeats – that is how Barca have performed in La Liga this season, collecting just eight points from their six matches to sit 12th in the table ahead of this weekend’s clash. The Catalan giants – beaten to last season’s Spanish title by Real Madrid – are already nine points off the top of the division, although they do have two games in hand over current leaders Real Sociedad. Koeman’s side have collected just two points from their last four league matches, losing back-to-back fixtures against Getafe and Real Madrid before drawing at Alaves last weekend. Barca have been impressive in the Champions League this season, though, winning all three of their group matches against Ferencvaros, Juventus and Dynamo Kiev to collect nine points from an available nine.
