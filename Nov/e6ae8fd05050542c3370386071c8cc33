The Police in Delta have launched manhunt for an alleged internet fraudster over the murder of a bus driver in Ibusa, Oshimili North LGA. The development forced members of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) Ibusa branch refusing to ply the Ibusa-Asaba route. It was gathered the bus driver hit the alleged fraudsterâ€™s car in Asaba while leaving the park for Ibusa with passengers. It was learnt the bus driver alighted to beg the young man who was furious over the dent on the car. The Nation learnt other drivers and passengers joined the bus driver to beg for forgiveness. But the alleged fraudster was said to have pounced on the bus driver, demanding the repair of his car. It was gathered the matter was resolved as parties went their separate ways. But the dissatisfied fraudster was said to have trailed the bus driver to Ibusa, the last bus stop. The bus driver reportedly knelt down on the road to plead for forgiveness again but the alleged fraudster entered his car and crushed him to death.
