Pop superstar David Adeleke popularly known as Davido has opened up on how he joined the #ENDSARS protest. He spoke on Apple Radio’s Africa Now with DJ Cuppy at the weekend. According to him: “When I first got there they were attacking me and people were even angry at me that why am I just coming? Where have I been? “I could see the pain on the faces of Nigerians. Especially with the background that I am from, I felt it would be very insensitive for me not to lend my voice. “The next day, I went to see the Inspector General of Police and it was not really productive if you ask me. What I mean by productive is the fact that they did not act on our demands.” The Assurance coroner his viral picture where he sat on the ground with other protesters with his hands raised in the air was his way of signalling that he came in peace. “In the picture of me that circulated around social media where I was sitting on the floor with my hands in the air, all I was trying to do was to inform them that I come in peace. I watch a lot of news and protests that are staged all over the world and that is what I see them do. That is why I asked everyone to sit on the floor. It was amazing to be part of that. “Fem being the anthem for the protest was just a matter of timing. I recorded Fem since May. There is a post on my page where I put a 20 seconds snippet of Fem way back in June. I did not see this coming. “When I released the song, I realized that three weeks later everybody was singing it at protest grounds. When I went to the National Assembly building they said that I went to record a song for them. “I had to explain to them that I had recorded the song since June. I was happy that they used my song as a voice for a non-violent protest. They were really enjoying it.”
