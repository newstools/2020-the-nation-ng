The Nageri Nakowa Motorcycle Owners And Riders Association (NNAMORAL) has said its members were not part of the crisis. Public Relations Officer Comrade Aliyu Rasak, who spoke with reporters at Akesan, expressed displeasure at how ‘fake news is peddled without verification’. He said members of the association would never disrupt the peace of Lagos State, adding that the association had no issue with any government institution, hence would ‘never go against them, no matter what’. Comrade Rasak pledged NNAMORAL’s ‘full support for the state and its plans for transportation’. NNAMORAL, he added, will continue to ‘adhere to Lagos State traffic rules’. He also urged members of the association to be more ‘careful on the designated roads as we enter the yuletide.”
