 University don, Prof. Chiroma  Maigana, has called  for   investment in the agriculture and agri-food industry to create jobs and ensure the sector punches above its weight in a competitive global market. Maigana, of the Department of Soil Science, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Maiduguri, stressed that there was a need for the government and the private sector to accelerate rural agriculture automation to increase competitiveness and improve profitability for farmers. This, according to him, would drive creation of  jobs and new businesses. “Information technology can support better crop, fertiliser and pesticide selection. It also improves land and water management, provides access to weather information, and connects farmers to sources of credit. Simply giving farmer’s information about crop prices in different markets has increased their bargaining power,” he said, adding that in the agriculture and food sector, the spread of mobile technologies, remote-sensing services and distributed computing are already improving smallholders’ access to information, inputs, market, finance and training.  He said setting the agricultural sector requires farmers to adopt new technologies and processes to stay competitive. As demand for food grows, Maigana said the industry needs to embrace approaches and processes, in conjunction with meaningful partnerships that will enable it meet the challenge   and identify opportunities across the value chain.
