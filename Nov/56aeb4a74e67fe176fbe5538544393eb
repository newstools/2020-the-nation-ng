 Lagos State Government has rejected a Freedom of Information request for the CCTV footage of the shooting of unarmed protesters at the Lekki toll plaza on October 20, 2020. This is contained in a letter written by Deyemi Bamgbose on behalf of the Attorney-General of Lagos State. A human rights lawyer, Inibehe Effiong, had written a letter to the state government last week invoking the Freedom of Information Act 2011. Effiong had in the letter addressed to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, requested for the CCTV footage in the interest of the public. However, in a response dated November 3, 2020 titled: ‘Re: Urgent Request Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act 2011’, the state government said it could not make the CCTV footage available because the FoI Act is a federal law and doesn’t apply to states. The government also cited a 2018 Court of Appeal judgement to back its claim.
