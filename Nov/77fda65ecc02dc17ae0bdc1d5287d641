A Federal High Court in Lagos on Wednesday adjourned ruling in a ‘no case’ application by a social media celebrity, Ismail Mustapha, till December 9. Mustapha is facing a N32.9 billion fraud charge. At the court’s last sitting on October 14, Justice Mohammed Liman fixed yesterday to deliver his ruling after hearing an application by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) opposing Mompha’s prayer. But when the case was called, court officials informed Abbas Mohammed (prosecution) and defence lawyer Ademola Adefolaju, who held the brief of Gboyega Oyewole (SAN), that the ruling had been further extended. They were told the ruling was not ready and that Justice Hassan was on official assignment outside the court’s jurisdiction. Mustapha, alias Mompha, and his firm, Ismalob Global Investment Ltd, were on March 4, 2020 re-arraigned before Liman on 22 counts of alleged money laundering and cyber fraud. They were first arraigned on a 14-count charge on November 25, 2019, following his arrest on October 19, 2019, at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja. Mompha pleaded not guilty and is out on bail. The EFCC opened trial and called 10 witnesses who testified against both defendants.
