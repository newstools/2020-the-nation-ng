The Lagos State Government has been called upon to dialogue with youths in the state over the recent shooting at the Lekki Toll Gate during the #EndSARS protest. The call was made by Apostle Adagba, the Chairman of the Lagos State chapter of Cherubim & Seraphim Unification Church of Nigeria, while addressing participants during the opening of the 7th Annual General Conference of the chapter held at Divine Events Centre at Obanikoro area of state. The three-day event, which ended on yesterday, was graced by delegates from all C&S churches across the state. Apostle Adagba urged the youths in the state to co-operate with the state government in its efforts to find solutions to problems confronting youths.  He said: “As a spiritual organization, we commiserate with the families of victims of the protest. It was a sad experience that we do not wish a reoccurrence in the state and in other parts of the country. “It is necessary for the aggrieved youths to allow the government investigate all that transpired during the shooting saga. In the end, everybody will be happy.” In his speech, the representative of the Supreme Head of the C&S Unification Church of Nigeria, Snr. Supt. Apostle Emmanuel Owomoyela, commended the Lagos State chapter executive for the sustenance of the ideals of the church in the state.
