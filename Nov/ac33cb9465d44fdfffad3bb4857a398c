Members of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), those of Apo Mechanic Traders Association and a non-government organisation (NGO), Shelter Initiative for African Women, have claim that they lost about N2.5 billion when hoodlums looted and vandalised their properties during and after the #EndSARS protests in Abuja. They made the claims on Tuesday when their representatives appeared before the FCT Ministerial Committee on Assessment of Damages during the #EndSARS protest. The panel, headed by Idris Abass, was constituted to verify claims from bodies that were badly impacted by the looting. Chairman of MAN FCT Chapter, Odun Emasealu, estimated that properties valued at N1.5 billion were vandalised by hoodlums at the Idu Industrial Estate in Abuja. He said 12 factories were damaged by miscreants while four warehouses belonging to the association were looted. Apo Traders Association, whose mechanic workshop was razed by hoodlums, said two of their members – Luka Bitrus Ganklin and Elisha Ayuba – were killed during the riot. The association’s Secretary Okhueleigbe Desmond, said properties, particularly cars and block moulding equipment that belonged to the members, were burnt. The traders demanded N932 million as compensation for the properties they lost to the crisis.
