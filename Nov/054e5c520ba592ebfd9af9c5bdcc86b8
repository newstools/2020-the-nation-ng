Abia State Governor Okezie Ikpeazu has decried the destruction of government and private facilities during the EnsSARS protest by aggrieved youths in Umuahia, the state capital, and Aba, the state’s commercial nerve centre. The governor restated his administration commitment and preparedness to provide tight security to the residents and those doing business in any part of the state. Ikpeazu spoke after inspecting various properties destroyed by hoodlums in Aba during the EndSARS protest. He described the period of the protest in Aba as a black week. The governor noted that there was no ethnic nationality in the country that was not affected by the destruction. According to him, the wanton destruction of properties during the protest was a self-inflicted injury on our national psyche and the fabric that holds us together. The governor said: “In fact, it was an injury to humanity as a whole.” Ikpeazu, who said the loss incurred in the aftermath of the protest was monumental, added that he did not know how long it would take to rebuild the damaged facilities. But the governor promised that “we will rise from the ashes of the black week”. He thanked law enforcement officers for quelling the situation and commiserated with those who lost relations as well as those who lost valuables during the incident.
