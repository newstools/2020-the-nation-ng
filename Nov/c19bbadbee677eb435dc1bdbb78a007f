 Undefeated Efetobor Apochi picked up his 10th knockout in as many professional fights, beating American Joe Jones inside of three rounds at a crowd less Staples Center in Los Angeles over the weekend. The Nigerian Nightmare, showing no sign of being rusty, scored knockdowns in each of the three rounds of action, the last of which prompted referee Thomas Taylor to stop the contest at 0:51 of round three. Apochi won a bronze medal at the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games, also knocking out Larry Pryor in his last fight in October last year. Jones, who had lost two of his 13 fights, did his best to remain mobile and avoid the massive punching power of his foe but the Nigerian Cruiserweight showed poise and ring smarts, not wasting any punches and making every power shot count. Apochi, trained by Heavyweight prospect  Efe Ajagba’s former trainer Ronnie Shields, dropped Jones three times; the first- a straight right, left hook and right hand—to send Jones to the canvas. Another three punch combination from Apochi in the second round once again put Jones down before a combination by the 33-year old Delta state native closed the show early in round three, even as Jones protested the outcome.
