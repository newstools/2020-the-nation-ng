 DESPITE the COVID-19 pandemic, the sponsors of Nigeria’s oldest sporting competition, the annual Asoju Oba Molade Okoya-Thomas Table Tennis Cup will be staged this year between November 30  and December 1 at the Molade Okoya-Thomas Hall of Teslim Balogun Stadium. Organisers said the tournament which is in its 52nd  edition will be held  in line with COVID-19 protocols laid down by the Lagos State Sports Commission (LSSC) for players competing for honours in men and women singles events. According to Ayodeji Okoya-Thomas,  this year would be the sixth edition without the initiator who passed on after the 46th  edition in 2014, while the tournament would be limited to two events this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “We have decided to organise this year’s tournament being the 52nd  edition in order to ensure the tournament continues uninterrupted being one of the oldest sporting competitions in the country,”he said. He continued: “ We will surely observe the laid-down COVID-19 protocol for all participants and guests during the competition. As usual we will reward outstanding players and we believe this competition will also help to prepare Lagos State athletes for the forthcoming National Sports Festival in Edo State.”
