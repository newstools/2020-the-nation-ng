Months after 11-year-old Favour Okechukwu was raped and killed at Ejigbo, Lagos, the Women’s Right and Health Project (WRAHP) has held a community town hall meeting to monitor the implementation of priorities identified in initial meetings with the people of Ayobo, Ipaja LCDA to prevent a recurrence. According to the Programme Manager, James Unegbu, they hold town halls to enable the community take stock of gender-based violence cases, challenges and proffer solutions. He said: “We want the people to tell us what the problem is and why they are not reporting so we can take it up from there. It is also an event to encourage them to keep reporting.” Asked how they ensure cases are not kept aside due to bribe, Unegbu said they have a technical working committee in Alimosho that comprises the police, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation (WAPA), Office of the Police Defender (OPD) and other sectors involved in providing justice.
