Sunday’s match at Emirates Stadium was in its early stages when Jimenez and Gunners defender David Luiz accidently collided at an Arsenal corner. Jimenez, 29, was given oxygen on the pitch and the game was stopped for around 10 minutes. “You start hearing ‘code red’,” said Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo. “It was a bad moment. What was the reaction? Panic, panic panic. You could see the faces on the team-mates. It was a serious situation. It’s awful and terrible.” Nuno’s Arsenal counterpart Mikel Arteta said he knew “something really bad is happening” from the reaction of the players. Brazil centre-back Luiz, 33, played on with a bandage wrapped around his head before being substituted at half-time. Wolves climb to sixth with rare win at Arsenal Nuno said Mexico striker Jimenez was having a scan and added: “He speaks, he’s aware. We have to have a proper assessment. He’s in good hands.” Jimenez, who was carried off the pitch on a stretcher, scored 17 goals as Wolves finished seventh in the Premier League last season.
