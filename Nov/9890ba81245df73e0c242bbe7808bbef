 MEMBERS of the Police Community Relations Commission (PCRC) in Zone 9, comprising Abia, Imo and Ebonyi States, have threatened to resign. The threat follows the alleged imposition of Collins Obi as chairman of the committee by the Assistant Inspector-General of Police (AIG), Tijani Babani. Arising from an emergency meeting in Owerri, Imo State, Chairman of the seven-man committee, Chima Chukwunyere, accused Babani of imposing Obi on them after he had spent 10 years in office. He said: “Obi’s tenure has expired and the national headquarters called for election on April 18, 2018. However, as soon as it dawned on Obi that majority of the delegates would vote for his opponent, he brought in thugs to disrupt the exercise held at Zone 9 police command in Umuahia, Abia State.” Chukwunyere explained that after the election was aborted, the National Working Committee (NWC) and National Executive Council (NEC), having suspended and later expelled Obi, appointed a seven-man caretaker committee on September 29 to take over the zone’s leadership. “Again the Zone 9 police authorities refused to accept the NWC recommendation and so Obi was imposed on us as chairman. “It is clear that the zone 9 police authorities do not have regard and respect for the organisation and its members. With this situation, there is no PCRC in the zone until the national chairman and the police hierarchy in Abuja address our grievances.” But Obi said he remains chairman of the zone after a duly conducted election. “I have spent six years not 10 years as claimed,” he said. Babani refused to speak on phone.
