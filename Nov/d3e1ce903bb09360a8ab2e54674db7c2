 THE palace of the Obong of Calabar, His Eminence Edidem Ekpo Okon Abasi Otu V, has said the Obong has nothing personal against Prof. Ben Ayade, the governor of Cross River State. The clarification came on Sunday from a palace source who pleaded anonymity and insisted that the Obong will not speak further on the matter, “but the truth is that the Obong has nothing personal against Governor Ayade”. Our source said the Obong spoke when he received in audience, former governor Liyel Imoke on a visit in the wake of the devastating destruction of properties of the government, individuals and organisations. “The Obong is unhappy about the level of wanton destruction of government institutions, structures and private investments in Calabar, Akpabuyo and Bakassi local government areas. The protest was purportedly on the #EndSARS agitation and it became hijacked by violent elements”, the palace source said. He added: “The Obong believes there was a security breakdown in the state on October 23 and 24 with the governor as the chief security officer of the state not holding a timely security council meeting of the state.” In a swift reaction to the position of the Obong suggesting that the governor should step aside, Mr. Asu Okang, the commissioner for Information, said: “We are in a democracy and everybody is entitled to his or her opinion.”
