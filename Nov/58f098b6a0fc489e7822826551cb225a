Nigeria International Ola Aina was a relieved man after scoring  his first Premier League goal in Fulham’s 2-0 win over West Brom on Monday. The full-back, who made his top-flight debut for Chelsea in 2016, scored his first Premier League goal, a thunderous left-footed strike into the top corner, to help the Cottagers on their way to a comfortable 2-0 win over Slaven Bilic’s West Brom. It lifted Fulham off the foot of the table and out of the relegation zone. “It was massive,” Aina told Standard Sport. “Everyone knows it has been a tough start to the season and to get the three points and the clean sheet, those things are very important. “We dug in and really showed some resilience, it is an amazing feeling. It is a long season, the team and myself have to take every game as it comes. He continued: “It is always special getting your first Premier League goal,” he said. “It has been a long time since I made my League debut. “I am just glad that the goal came and I was able to help the team with it.It is a dream to play in the Premier League and score, and get games in the Premier League. When I left Chelsea, it was kick-starting a career for myself. “I always wanted to come back and play in the Premier League. I am just happy that I am making it a reality.”  Meanwhile, Fulham manager Scott Parker has showered encomium on Aina, expressing his pleasure with the effort and believes the goal came on the back of his instruction to the Super Eagles defender to take more risks.
