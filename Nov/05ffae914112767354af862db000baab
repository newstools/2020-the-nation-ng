The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has said no court order had restrained it from conducting the proposed membership re-validation and registration. A statement on Wednesday in Abuja by its Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Yekini Nabena, said APC had investigated the purported court order and found that no such court order was ever granted. The statement said: “In respect of the suit, a Legal Officer was sent to court on November 17, 2020, to investigate the purported court order restraining the APC from conducting membership registration. “Upon our findings, we discovered that such court order was never granted by the court, as no application was made to the Court to warrant the granting of such order. “The evidence from the records of proceedings of Monday, November 16, 2020, shows that no order restraining the party from conducting the membership registration was granted in respect of the above suit or any (other) suit relating to the APC. “The APC makes bold to assert that the purported court order was erroneously reported and the party urges the general public to disregard it. We equally call on our teeming party supporters, members and leaders to ignore the fake news and go about their good work of repositioning the party.”
