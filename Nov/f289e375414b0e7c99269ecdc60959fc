 These are not the best of times for the governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki. More than two months after his re-election as the governor of the oil-rich state, he is yet to appoint his cabinet save the appointment of his man Friday, Osarodion Ogie, as the Secretary to the State Government (SSG) because of pressure. While the calls grow louder for the governor to name the members of his cabinet, he is scratching his head day and night, wondering how to make the appointments without offending his supporters who are now split between his former party, the All Progressives Congress (APC) and his adopted party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). PDP leaders and supporters are on the governorâ€™s neck to appoint their own people as commissioners and special advisers while he also has his own people in APC, including Anslem Ojezua, who remains yet the chairman of the party in Edo in spite of the defection of his paymaster to the PDP. As things stand, Obaseki has one leg in PDP and one in APC, making the task of satisfying both interests in his cabinet appointments a tough call.
