 THE Chief Medical Director (CMD) of the Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Keffi, in Nasarawa State, Dr Yahaya Baba Adamu, has disclosed that the hospital treated over 170 patients infected with COVID-19. The CMD, who made the disclosure yesterday when interacting with journalists in his office in Keffi, said three patients of Covid 19 died in the hospital. He said: “In this hospital, as of my last count, we have treated over 170 cases and discharged them. Among that I think three died in the hospital after about two or three days on admission. “Most of the others were discovered to have COVID-19 after they died. They were either four or five.” He added that because of the low number of COVID-19 patients in the country currently, the FMC, Keffi, does not have plenty patients as it used to be. He said: “In fact, sometimes, we don’t even have any patient. But recently, I am aware that we have one or two patients on admission and I have not been told that they have been discharged. The CMD said when patients are symptomatic, like the one or two that the hospital admitted recently, the health personnel keep them in the hospital and treat them.
