A former chairman of Kirfi Local Government Area of Bauchi State, Alhaji Bappa Danmalikin Bara, has dumped the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the All Progressives Congress (APC). The ex-chairman told reporters on Wednesday in Bauchi, the state capital that his decision to dump the PDP was due to alleged unfair treatment meted out to him by Governor Bala Mohammed, who suspended him when he was the caretaker chairman for 10 months, without fair hearing. He said: “I was one of the supporters of PDP during the 2019 electioneering campaign, during which I contributed my time, energy and experience in promoting the political ideals, but at the end I was treated unfairly. “Looking at the political trend in the country and after due consultations with my people and other political associates, I decided to defect from my party (PDP) to the APC as from today.’’
