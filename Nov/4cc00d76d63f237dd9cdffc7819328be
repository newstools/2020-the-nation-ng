The wife of Ekiti State Governor Erelu Bisi Fayemi has distributed cash and other empowerment packages worth N6.9 million to 82 survivors of Gender Based Violence (GBV). Items distributed to the victims of rape, domestic violence, neglect by spouses and many others included cash gift, sewing machines, freezers and food items. Addressing the beneficiaries at her office in Ado-Ekiti last Saturday, Mrs. Fayemi said the gesture was to rescue the victims from poverty and neglect common among people in this category. She said the current government under the leadership of Governor Kayode Fayemi would fight rape, domestic violence and child slavery and trafficking, to safeguard the future of the citizens. Mrs. Fayemi said the empowerment was targeted at women being the major victims of GBV. “I want you to use these materials very well. Don’t use them for burials and don’t give them out to anybody.”
