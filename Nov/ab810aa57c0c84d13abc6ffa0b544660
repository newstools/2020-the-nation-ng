A witness, Mr. Kwalekeme Cletus, Monday, appealed for the release of the corpse of his nephew, Ogbodobiri Ebifemene, who died in police custody on November 17th, 2015 for burial. Kwalekeme had in a petition JP/A/6/2020 to the nine member Delta State Judicial Panel of Inquiry on Police Brutality and Extra judicial Killings narrated how his nephew, Ogbodobiri Ebifemene, 36 years old, a nightwatch man at the Delta State Ministry of Oil and Gas, was arrested over a missing laptop belonging to one Mr. Omadoye Godwin, a special adviser to Mofe Pirah, Commissioner for Oil and Gas. He said before he could secure administrative bail of the victim from Police “A” Division in Asaba his nephew had been tortured to death in the cell. Kwalekeme lamented that five years after the death of his nephew, following a post mortem, his corpse has not been released. He said Inspector Onwuegbuzie Simon and his team collected N100, 000 as bail for the release of his nephew unaware that his nephew had died. Counsel to the petitioner, Ogbomade Emmanuel urged the panel to direct the Nigerian Police to release the victims’ corpse. He said the petitioner have confirmed that the corpse might have been mass buried. “There is something vital and current in this petition. It is the availability of the corpse. We have written to the police to release the corpse but there is no response so we are here to follow me justice.” Counsel to the respondent, F.M Odunna assured that the police will act. Chairman of the panel, Justice Celestina Ogisi (rtd) ruled that the body of the victim be released before the next adjourned date. She adjourned the matter to November 30th, 2020.
