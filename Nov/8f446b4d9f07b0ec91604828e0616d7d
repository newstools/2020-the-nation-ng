The lawmaker representing Sabon-Gari Federal Constituency of Kaduna State in the House of Representatives, Garba Datti Muhammad, has urged the Federal Government to end kidnapping and other crimes at Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria, Kaduna State. He condemned the recent kidnappings and abduction of workers and students of the university by some criminals. Muhammad expressed the concern in a statement on Wednesday in Abuja. The lawmaker sought the government’s intervention to end the persistent security threats against students and workers of the university. He said: “The sad consequence is that the university is at the serious risk of being unable to promise the serene and conducive atmosphere that is a sine qua non for its purpose as an institution of higher learning.  “We, therefore, vehemently condemn these acts of terrorism in all parts of Kaduna State and the federation and state that this must stop.”
