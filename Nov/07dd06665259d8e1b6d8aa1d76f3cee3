 Port Harcourt based gospel artist, Agbani Horsfall, has released a new song entitled, ‘One Nigeria.’ According to Horsfall, the track is inspired by the Holy Spirit. She recalls one evening as she was surfing the net and she stumbled on a picture of an old woman with tears in her eyes, she got so emotional that she was almost in tears, so she turned to the Lord and that was the Genesis of the song. She reveals One Nigeria is about things happening in the country. “The youths are going through a lot now or when innocent lives are being wasted sometimes over nothing. But most recently the youths asking for a change in the #endsars #endbrutality #goodgovernance movement that has claimed a lot of lives and properties. “The song is a reminder to the nation that we will overcome and things will return to normal very soon,” she said. The gospel musician further said, “Nigerians who seek change and a better government, I will urge them to keep praying and raising their voices for a better nation for ourselves, our children and our generation. We should not give up. “To Nigerians who have lost loved ones during the protest, during the police brutality, in one form or the other, they should be consoled that God has not forgotten them.” Horsfall also revealed that she sang the track in English for the message to be clear for all to understand. But she is optimistic that the track will be translated into other Nigerian languages.
