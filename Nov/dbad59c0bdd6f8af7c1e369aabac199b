 MOLDE FK  attacker Leke James is upbeat  that ahead of Thursday’s  Europa League Group B cracker against Arsenal, saying  he and his teammates  will  not  be jittery when they visit the Emirates Stadium in London. The Norwegian league reigning champions have had two wins in as many matches  like the Gunners in Europe’s second-tier club competition following victories against Dundalk and Rapid Vienna. “It is no doubt a big game and we are looking forward to with high hope and spirits but we are not jittery at all,” explained James who clocked 28 years on Sunday. “We are going to the Emirates Stadium to do what we know how to do best, “We prepared for it with the emphatic away win we got at Mjondalen. The victory and the goal I scored were perfect birthday gifts for me. “ I dedicate the goal to the Almighty God who has kept me and my career alive till now. ” It has been a very tough season for us with the number of injuries we have recorded.”
