Interior Minister Rauf Aregbesola has condemned the attack on The Nation corporate office in Lagos by arsonists during the #EndSARS protest. In a letter to the newspapers’ Managing Director/Editor-in-Chief Victor Ifijeh, the minister said he was “greatly pained” when he got the report of the attack. “I write to commiserate with you and other members of staff of this organisation on the recent disturbances in Lagos. While the saga lasted, arsonists invaded your premises and set fire on vehicles and parts of the building, with some items looted,” he said. The Nation, Aregbesola said, has changed the face of journalism since its entry into the market, dictating the pace through in-depth news reporting, informed commentary and Leader writing. He said: “You have defended freedom; promoted democracy and have always placed the nation (pun unintended) first, even at the expense of your economic interest. You have been the standard-bearer of the truth. “It is ironic that your leading article a day before the cowardly attack on your premises identified with the #EndSARS demonstrators and was unsparing of the Federal Government. The attack is, therefore, absolutely unjustified.” The Nation titles, he said, will continue to thrive and “history will be very kind to you for the role you have played in the long tortuous path of Nigeria’s development”.
