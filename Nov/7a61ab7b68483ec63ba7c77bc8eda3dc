Three Commissioners in Niger state have tested positive for COVID-19. Two of the commissioners reported to have tested positive are from Niger south Senatorial zone while the third is said to be from Niger East senatorial district. This has caused tension in the state executive council and the staff of the affected ministries. The Commissioners went for testing when they showed symptoms of the disease after the state executive sitting last week. The Secretary to the Niger State Government (SSG), Ahmed Ibrahim Matane when contacted said that directive has been issued that all Commissioners in the state should subject themselves to COVID-19 test. He said that four Commissioners have already submitted themselves to the test and the results were negative adding that others are yet to be tested because they are currently out of the state. Matane added that when they return, all commissioners will be tested. He, however, ruled out the investigation are of a spike in COVID-19 cases in the state while advising the people to adhere to the safety protocols. “We are not thinking of another lockdown, but we will continue to watch as things unfold.”
