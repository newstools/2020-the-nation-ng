 After positively disrupting society with six strategic theatre productions that include ‘Loud Whispers’, Isale Eko, Oba Esugbayi, 3some, Emotan, and Aremu, Joseph Edgar’s Duke of Shomolu production is back. The rich theatre tradition returns this December with Segun Adefila’s ‘Our Duke Has Gone Mad Again,’ an anthology of works running the whole gamut of emotions. A statement from the production house says ‘Our Duke Has Gone Mad Again,’ will run for two days between December 25 and 26 at The Finery, Probyn Road Ikoyi, Lagos. It was also revealed that Segun Adefila will work as the director while William Benson will serve as Coordinating Director. Dr. Ibiene Ogolo, Mofoluwake Edgar, and Olisa Adibua serve as co-executive producers. The play will feature Patrick Diabuah, Kelvin Mary Ndukwe, Kemi Bickersteth, and the talented Chantal Edgar. Speaking on the production, Edgar said, “from cast to the venue which is the lush gardens nestled in upper-class Ikoyi to the dress code prescribed for attendees and the celebration of prominent Nigerians who have supported the Duke of Shomolu and Nigerian theatre by extension. Our Duke Has Gone Mad Again is an anthology of works running the whole gamut of emotions ranging from excitement at life down to the sharp pain of sorrow occasioned by the loss of a loved one. “The monologue will serve as a soothing balm on society just emerging from the ravages of the pandemic serving as a guide and serve as an arrowhead on the way to self-reawakening. They will provide unusual entertainment while addressing issues of life and living,” he said.
