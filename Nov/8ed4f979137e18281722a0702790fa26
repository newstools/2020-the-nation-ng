 BODY of a make-up artist reportedly kidnapped in Enugu last Wednesday has been discovered. Ijeoma Neke was allegedly booked for a make-up session with a yet-to-be identified client on the day she went missing. One of her friends said a customer called Ijeoma for a job on Wednesday and told her to come to ESBS bus stop so she would be taken to the place. It was gathered that Ijeoma could not be reached after some hours, fuelling speculations that she might have been kidnapped. Her friends and relatives formed a search party but their efforts were futile until yesterday morning when her body was found at Maryland, a suburb of Enugu. Eyewitnesses said the body appeared to have been bathed in a substance suspected to be acid, leading to its mutilation. Police spokesman Daniel Ndukwe said his office had not received reports of the kidnap or discovery of the body as at last night.
