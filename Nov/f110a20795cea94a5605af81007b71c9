The Abia State Police Command has said it had arrested a septuagenarian and 20 other suspects for alleged involvement in the killings, looting and burning of government and private properties following the #EndSARS protest in Aba and Umuahia, the state capital. Addressing reporters in Umuahia before parading the suspects, Police Commissioner Janet Agbede said the protesters allegedly killed two policemen during the protests by beheading and burning them. Agbede said while the military and police jointly repelled the hoodlums from attacking the Umuahia Correctional Service Centre, the crooks looted and burnt a building housing the Dragon Squad, a unit of the police at old Zone 6 Annex at Ogbor Hill, off the Aba city center. The police commissioner said five banks, a High Court, one Magistratesâ€™ Court and Aba town hall and the church inside it were torched. The places that were destroyed also included the state fire service building at Aba, 102 government and privately-owned vehicles, street lights in Aba and Umuahia as well as the dislodging of traders from onions, yam and water melon markets in Aba. Agbede said one FNC rifle with 12 rounds of live ammunition was recovered from the home of the 70-year-old suspect, Umunna Eze. She debunked the rumour that herdsmen were grouping to attack the state. The police commissioner gave looters who had not returned what they stole one week to return them or face the wrath of the law.
