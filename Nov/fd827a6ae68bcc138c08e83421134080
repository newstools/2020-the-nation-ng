With the arrest and detention of Senator Ali Ndume due to Abdurasheed Maina’s failure to appear in court, there are fears in the camps of Senators Ike Ekweremadu and Enyinnaya Abaribe, that soon they may also have to answer for the continued absence in court of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). The Federal High Court in Abuja ordered Ndume remanded at the Kuje Correctional Center, following his inability to produce the former Chairman of the defunct Pension Reform Task Team, whom he stood surety for. Sentry gathered that lots of consultations are going on across the Southeastern political zone as part of moves to avoid a situation where the two senators will be detained in lieu of the IPOB chief. It was gathered that supporters, allies and associates of the frontline Igbo politicians have been expressing dissatisfaction with the disappearance of Kanu, following the detention of Ndume. This is just as calls are heightening across the country for Ekweremadu and Abaribe to be treated the same way as Ndume. The Arewa Youth Consultative Forum (AYCF) during the week demanded immediate arrest and prosecution of Abaribe for his role in the freedom of Kanu. Also, Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) led by Nastura Sheriff alleged bias in the order for Ndume’s detention while Ekweremadu and Abaribe are still walking free. The groups claimed that since Senator Ndume was arrested for failing to produce Maina, Ekweremadu and Abaribe must also be arrested for Kanu’s ‘disappearance.’
