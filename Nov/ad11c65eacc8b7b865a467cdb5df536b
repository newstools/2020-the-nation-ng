Manchester United have reportedly contacted Cristiano Ronaldo with the view to re-signing the Portugal international during next summer’s transfer window. The 35-year-old’s existing deal with Juventus is due to run until June 2022, but the Italian champions are allegedly keen to offload the attacker next summer to reduce the wage bill. Paris Saint-Germain have been strongly linked with the forward, but according to FOX Sports journalist Christian Martin, United are in talks with the Portuguese over a return, and Juve would be prepared to negotiate with the 20-time English champions.  “Our sources in Manchester and Porto confirm that Manchester United tempted Cristiano Ronaldo with a return to the club for next season. The Portuguese star is considering it. Juventus will negotiate a deal if Ronaldo asks for it,” Martin posted on Twitter. Ronaldo turned out for United between 2003 and 2009, scoring 118 goals in 292 appearances, winning three Premier League titles, one FA Cup and one Champions League in the process. The five-time Ballon d’Or winner has scored 71 times in 94 appearances for Juve since arriving from Real Madrid, including six  goals in five outings in all competitions this term.
