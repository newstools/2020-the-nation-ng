Security men attached to convoy of chairman, South East Governors Forum and Ebonyi Governor, Dave Umahi, at the weekend allegedly brutalised a motorist at Akabo on the Owerri- Okigwe expressway in Imo State. The incident reportedly occurred around 7:30pm at a spot popularly known as Ori-Akabo. An eyewitness said: “I saw army and police personnel attached to the governor’s convoy flogging the motorist whose car had spoiled, owing to the gridlock on the road.” Umahi was on his way from Ebonyi to see his Imo counterpart, Hope Uzodimma. Though, the Governor did not come down from his car, according to the witness, he claimed the crest on the vehicles reads: ” Ebonyi State Governor.” “One of the security men who was whipping and kicking the motorist was overheard saying” how dare you block the convoy of the governor? A bloody civilian like you? We can kill you here and nothing will happen.” The motorist had told the overzealous security aides his car had broken down following traffic girdlock. One of the security aides was said to have dragged him (motorist) out of the car and attempted to switch on the engine which did not start. Embittered by the development, the security aides reportedly descended on the motorist and pushed the vehicle to a nearby fuel station. The motorist, who was writhing with pains, was abandoned on the ground while the security aides made way for the Governor’s entourage to drive past. Other motorists came down thereafter and attended to the brutalised motorist. It was gathered the brutalised motorist was later taken to a nearby hospital. When contacted, Special Adviser to Umahi on media, Francis Nwaze, said that he was not aware of the incident.
