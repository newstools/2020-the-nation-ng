 A talented female guitarist and Afro-pop singer, Priscilla Gold, has debuted on the Nigerian music scene with Gbemileke. Born as Priscilla Okpaka, the debutant and a leading member of Lagos State Polytechnic Troupe (LASPET) said she uses the song to pray for excellence in life. ”We are going through a lot of issues in this country, hence, Gbemileke is an expression of our feelings and prayer for excellence in life. It’s not a religious music and the tracks are loaded with contemporary vibes that cut across all categories of people,” she says. Aside from Gbemileke, the 22-year-old guitarist has another track in the maxi-single, ”No going back” (sorosoke), a song dedicated to the EndSARS protests which recently swept through the country. She said an audio-visual version of acoustic guitar work on ”No going back” would be released in the coming weeks. “I am releasing an acoustic guitar version of ”No going back” with visuals to prove a point that my guitar skills are genuine. ”A female member of MFM church taught me the rudiments of how to play the guitar in 2014 and I furthered my knowledge of the music instrument through online tutorials. ”I learned how to play the guitar to master my music skills and voice; I practiced more with my guitar.” She added: ”I am currently a Higher National Diploma student of Mass Communication at LASPOTECH and I was selected into the school’s troupe after we were asked to submit a recorded song. Fortunately, my song was among the ones picked and some of my lecturers who spotted my talent felt that the song should be pushed beyond the school project. They gave my career a push by encouraging the school to produce Gbemileke and other songs.’’
