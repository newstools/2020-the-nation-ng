Ekiti State Council of Traditional Rulers has commiserated with its counterpart in Ondo on the death of the Olufon of Ifon, Oba Adegoke Adeusi. The first traditional ruler in Ose Local Government Area of Ondo was on Thursday killed by suspected kidnappers around Elegbeka, Owo-Ifon highway. In a statement by the Chairman and Alawe of Ilawe Ekit, Oba Adebanji Alabi, the Council of Traditional Rulers consoled members of the immediate family of the late Olufon, praying to God to grant them the fortitude to bear this great loss. Oba Alabi said it was unfortunate and painful the Olufon was killed by gunmen while on his way to his domain after an official engagement, describing the incident as worrisome and injurious to the tradition of Yoruba land. He noted that Oba Adeusi’s death has further buttressed and exemplified the point that the issue of insecurity should be handled with sheer seriousness it deserves. He called on both the Federal and state governments to further strengthened air and land surveillance to be able to know the criminals’ hideout so as to curtail their overbearing influence. “It is high time the Amotekun woke up to its fundamental responsibility and salvage the soutwest from the claws of criminal elements terrorising the region. “Amotekun must now commence its full operational throughout the South West geopolitical zone as a panacea for insecurity in the zone, especially during this season of yuletide”, he said.
