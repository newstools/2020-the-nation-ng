About four persons have reportedly been admitted to various hospitals in Umuahia North Local Government Area of Abia State capital where they are battling for their lives after being involved in multiple accidents along the Ikot Ekpene expressway, off BCA road junction. The accident involving the driver of an articulated vehicle with registration number Cross River DUK 584 XA, according to some eyewitnesses occurred when the articulate truck driver made effort to maneuver his way through the gridlock on the ever-busy road. The truck driver in the process of the maneuvering was said to have hit a woman and her child in a commercial tricycle carrying red oil, leaving them with varying degrees of injuries. The truck driver who had pretended as if he wants to pull over to assess the damage he has caused, suddenly zoomed off, ignoring a signal from a traffic warden in the area. In his attempt to escape, he was said to have also hit another tricycle as well as a Corolla SUV that had attempted to block him from escaping, leaving both automobiles beyond repair. Angered by the incident, youths of the area engaged him in hot pursuit and later apprehended him at Bende road by Amaeke Ibeku about 15 mins drive from the scene of the accident. The driver whose identity could not be ascertained at the time of filing the report was said to have jumped off the vehicle, leaving his conductor to his fate. He was handed over to the police pending the return of the driver. Apostle Christian Ulonnam, the youth leader of Nkata Ancient Kingdom Ibeku Umuahia in a chat disclosed that the presence of police personnel saved the situation from escalating to jungle justice. Until the time of filing the report, no case of death was recorded, but the injured victims are receiving treatment in yet-to-be-disclosed hospitals in the city center.
