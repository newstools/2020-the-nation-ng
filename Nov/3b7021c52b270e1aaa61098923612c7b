 IT took Cristiano Ronaldo just three minutes of action yesterday to score his first goal back since testing positive for COVID-19 to hand Juventus a 4-1 away win over Spezia. Ronaldo entered in the 56th minute of Juventus’ Serie A match against Spezia and found the left corner of the goal just three minutes later. In the 76th minute of the contest, Ronaldo scored for the second time in 20 minutes, chipping a penalty over the opposing keeper. Ronaldo first tested positive for COVID-19 on Oct. 13 while on international duty with Portugal. The Portuguese Federation announced at the time that he was “doing well, without symptoms, and in isolation.” He returned to Turin two days later to finish his isolation period at home. All of Ronaldo’s subsequent tests described him as asymptomatic.
