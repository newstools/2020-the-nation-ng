The second wave of COVID-19 infections is possible in the country, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) Director-General Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu, said on Monday. He urged for caution and responsibility to help prevent another outbreak of the pandemic. Ihekweazu spoke during an event organised by the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) in Abuja. He said: “The increasing number of COVID-19 cases in other parts of the world is a reminder that the virus is still with us and we cannot afford to be complacent. “The second wave of infection is possible in Nigeria but it is not inevitable. We can prevent it with our collective action and our collective responsibility “The virus does not know why people congregate. The virus does not know whether it is for NYSC, religious purposes, education, demonstration or partying. It makes use of all opportunities in equal measure to jump from one person to the other. “We must implement these measures that we know all the time and not be selective in the scenarios in which we implement them.” Ihekweazu said the NCDC, in the past few weeks, worked with officials of the NYSC, the National Orientation Agency (NOA) and ministries of health to introduce measures to limit the risk of COVID-19 exposure to corps members during the orientation camps. He said the corps members, officials and others will be screened on arrival at the camps.
