 SKY SPORTS pundit Kris Boyd has been raving about Rangers midfielder Joe Aribo, claiming that his early-season form has already made him a contender for the player of the year award at Ibrox. Aribo, 24, played a starring role for the Gers on Sunday as they beat Aberdeen 4-0 at Ibrox to move 11 points clear at the top of the Scottish Premiership table. The former Charlton midfielder has been outstanding this season, despite missing 10 matches with an ankle injury between August and October. Ex-Rangers striker Boyd claimed Aribo has already made himself a contender to win the player of the season award thanks to his brilliant form. “He’s a magnificent player, he’s another option for Steven Gerrard in that position,” said Boyd on Sky Sports “In the first few weeks of the season we were talking about somebody who already could have been the player of the year – he was that good. “Then, obviously, he missed out through injury and it took him a little while to get back but you saw in the last game here against Hamilton, the quality he has to get forward and score goals.”
