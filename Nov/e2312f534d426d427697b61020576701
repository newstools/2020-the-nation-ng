 Father of Nigerian Tourism Chief Mike Amachree has condoled with the Director General of the National Council of Arts Nigeria (NCAC) Otunba Segun Runsewe on the loss of his mother, the late Mrs. Felicia Adesola Runsewe (Mama Kaduna).  He urged Runsewe to take heart knowing fully well that his mother lived a godly life. He said the mother of the NCAC boss, who was a business woman in Kaduna for so many years, touched so many lives. Amachree added that the current contributions Runsewe is making in Nigeria’s public sector through astute leadership in tourism and culture are testament to the good work Mama Kaduna had put in training her children and inculcating in them values to be upright. This he said has made them excel in life, and also to become assets to the society. He said further: “At this period, the tourism and culture family are with Otunba Segun Runsewe, a great Nigerian and an astute public administrator who has helped propel the Nigerian culture and tourism industry to great heights. The impact of his leadership in the Nigerian Tourism Development Corporation (NTDC) is still being felt. We share in his grief and pray that the almighty God will console him and his family on the lost. We are supporting him in our prayers daily. I call on the Nigerian tourism family to identify with Runsewe during the burial rites of his mum as a show of appreciation for what he has done in the sector.” It will be recalled the late Mrs. Felicia Adesola  Runsewe nee Ademosun, aged 94 years, fondly called Mama Kaduna, lived and worked in Kaduna State as a prosperous business woman for about 60 years, before retiring to live in Lagos where she passed on. Mama Kaduna started her career with Kingsway stores, Kaduna before going into private business which endeared her to clients and neighbors, hence the name Mama Kaduna. She is survived by two children, Otunba Segun  Runsewe and Mrs Mopelola  Ayanfalu,  grandchildren and a great grandchild.
