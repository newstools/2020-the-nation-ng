The Hisbah, a shariah law enforcement agency in Kano state, on Friday banned traders from using the word ‘black’ in their Friday promo sales, in which customers buy goods at subsidised prices. This was made known in a letter by the Kano State Hisbah Board ordering Cool FM, a private broadcast media organisation, to stop running advertisements using the term “Black Friday.” The source of worry for Hisbah is the use of ‘black,’ the agency said. A letter dated November 26 and addressed to the Cool FM Manager, signed by Hisbah Principal Executive Officer II, Abubakar Muhammad Ali, directed the radio station to refrain from addressing Friday as “Black,” henceforth. Part of the letter reads: “I am directed to write and notify you that the office (Hisbah) is in receipt of complaint for the conduct of Black Friday Sales on 27th November, 2020. “Accordingly, we wish to express our concern on the tagging of Friday as “Black Friday,” and further inform you that the majority of the inhabitants of Kano state are Muslims that consider Friday as a Holy Day. “In view of the forgoing you are requested to stop calling the day as “Black Friday,” with immediate effect. “Note that Hisbah will be around for surveillance purposes, with a view to avoid occurrence of any immoral activity as well as maintaining of peace and stability in the state.” Commander General of Hisbah, Sheikh Aroun Ibn Sinah affirmed the determination by the board to enforce “total compliance to shariah injunctions” in all parts of Kano state. Hisbah had on November 8, confiscated and destroyed 1,975 bottles of beer estimated at N200 million, saying the consumption of alcohol is an “evil social act.” Sinah said the Hisbah board would continue to rid the state of all forms of immoral acts through campaigns, sermons and Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanism. It was gathered that Cool FM has pulled down all Black Friday related adverts in compliance with the directives of Hisbah.
