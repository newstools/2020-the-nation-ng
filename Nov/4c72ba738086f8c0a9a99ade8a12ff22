  THE counsel for Adebayo Akinola, a 39-year-old alleged rapist, Queen Nkiri, on Friday, told the presiding Magistrate Olusegun Ayilara,  that her client,  Akinola is not mentally stable. Akinola was arraigned before Osun State Magistrate Court sitting in Osogbo on two counts of unlawful sexual intercourse and taking undue advantage of a 16-year-old girl. The Police Prosecutor, John Idoko, informed the Chief Magistrate that Akinola on November 5, 2020,  around  6:30pm at Ataoja Estate unlawfully had sexual intercourse with a minor and took undue advantage of her mental and physical condition. He noted that the offence committed is contrary to Section 31(1)(2) and 32 of the Child’s Rights Laws of Osun State 2007. However, the accused person pleaded not guilty to the two counts preferred against him by the police. The counsel for the accused, Nkiri, made an oral bail application for the accused stressing that, “The accused person is mentally unstable and the mother of the accused person made us know that. We, hereby, apply for his bail on the most liberal term. The defendant has a reliable surety.” The police opposed the oral bail application made by the defence counsel and the Chief Magistrate, Ayilara, ordered that the accused person be remanded at the Ilesha Correctional  Centre. Ayilara adjourned the case to December 9, 2020, for ruling on the defendant’s  bail  application.
