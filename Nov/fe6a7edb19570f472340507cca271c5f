Minister of Water Resources Suleiman Adamu will take stock of the Clean Nigeria: Use the toilet Campaign, a private sector initiative designed to recognise open-defecation-free Local Government Areas on November 26. The one-year-old campaign has mobilised a high-level political support, resources and the entire populace towards building a new culture of safe and sustainable sanitation. Its first anniversary will unveil the Organised Private Sector in Water Sanitation and Hygiene (OPS-WASH) “Flushit” Initiative, according to a statement by the ministry’s Director of Information Kenechukwu Offie. On display too will be cutting-edge sanitation technologies and services as parts of the major highlights of the event. “There will also be investiture of Ambassadors for “Clean Nigeria: Use the Toilet Campaign. State governors will also be decorated as Open Defecation Free (ODF) Champions,” Offie noted in the statement. Nigeria targets 2025 to end the menace of open defecation across the nation. President Muhammadu Buhari, represented by V.P. Yemi Osinbajo, launched the campaign in Abuja on November 19, 2019.
