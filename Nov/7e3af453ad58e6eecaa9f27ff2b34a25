 As one of the 16 players competing in the 2020 ITTF Finals in Zhengzhou, China, Nigeria’s Quadri Aruna will today know his first round opponent at  the 2020 ITTF Finals to be held  in Zhengzhou, China. At the draw taking place today at JW Marriott Hotel Zhengzhou, Aruna and  15 other players are expected to be present to know their opponent for tomorrow’s kick off. The ITTF Finals would give all the participating players the chance to improve their World Ranking  with Aruna managing to pick up 765points  after  his first round exit at the just concluded World Cup.  “This Final is a bit more tasking than the just concluded World Cup because this is a knockout event and you can be drawn against any player in the world,” Aruna told NationSport. “So, it is more challenging and you have to be at your best to be sure of moving to the next stage of the event. “But  I am in good shape and right frame of mind for the tournament having gotten used to the time zone change,”  added Aruna.
