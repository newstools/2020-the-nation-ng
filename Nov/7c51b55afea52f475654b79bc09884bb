 The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has joined agitators for the restructuring of the politiy. But the party insisted on using the Report of the 2014 National Conference as a major plank for the restructuring. It rejected alleged moves by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to “smuggle in” its version of the report allegedly packaged by a committee headed by Kaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai. In a statement yesterday by its spokesman Kola Ologbondiyan, the main opposition accused the leadership of the APC of attempts to frustrate the widespread clamour and efforts by majority of Nigerians for genuine restructuring. The PDP said APC’s alleged attempt to change the original report for its version constituted a grievous assault on the collective sensibilities of millions of Nigerians whose collective interests are contained in the 2014 Conference Report.  The statement said: “Our party stands at the forefront of efforts for genuine restructuring, but we hold that the authentic materials for a genuine restructuring are contained in the 2014 National Conference Report, wherein Nigerians across all the divides collectively provided a road map out of our constitutional quagmires, and not a partisan report by the APC. “It is, therefore, unacceptable that the 2014 National Conference Report, which embodies the desires and hopes of over 200 million Nigerians, has been shelved by President Muhammadu Buhari since his predecessor in office, President Goodluck Jonathan, personally handed it over to him in 2015 for implementation, in line with the wishes and aspirations of the people. “Our party, therefore, charges President Buhari to bring out the 2014 National Conference Report, dust it up and present it as an Executive Bill to the National Assembly to guide the desired amendment to the 1999 Constitution (as amended) with regard to restructuring.”
