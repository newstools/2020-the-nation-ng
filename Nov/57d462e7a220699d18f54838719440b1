 THE Ijaw leader on Saturday lambasted the federal government on the purported plans by the Zamfara state government to sell the gold found in their state to Central Bank of Nigeria, describing the action as robbing Peter to pay Paul. The Ijaw leader and GMD/CEO of Babsfield Corporate Ventures, Chief Julius Babogha who made this statement while speaking to newsmen said the idea by the Zamfara state government is an eye opener to the leadership, governors and the good people of Niger Delta that have allowed their resources to be for the development of the nation, Nigeria. Babogha who lamented while speaking said Zamfara state government can go ahead to sell to sell their gold natural resources to the apex bank while the Niger Delta should also be brainstorming on what to do with their oil natural resources. He said, “At some point in time, this robbing Peter to pay Paul has to be reexamined and restructured to give room for one Nigeria for the purpose of unity and oneness and not this clear discrimination and not this sentiment that will not take this country anywhere. “As Zamfara could control their gold so also Niger Delta be allowed to have control of their oil and gas resources and enjoined Niger Delta governors, ministers, lawmakers and other stakeholders of oil rich region to meet and take position since the area cannot be left undeveloped when the money for the development of the country comes from the region.”
