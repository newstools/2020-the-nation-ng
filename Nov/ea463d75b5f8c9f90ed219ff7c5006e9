Racing Genk star Cyriel Dessers is not thinking about quitting the Nigeria national team despite his omission from the squad list for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Sierra Leone. The Belgian-born striker paid the price for his lack of playing time at Genk, having logged only 73 minutes in the Belgian First Division A since he returned from his first international duty with the Super Eagles. Dessers’ teammate at Racing Genk, Paul Onuachu is believed to be ahead of the former Heracles Almelo in the pecking order of strikers for club and country. “Thirteen internationals are missing,” Dessers told Tubantia on his teammates who were called up to represent their nations this month. “Last time Paul and I went together, this time I was not called up. I understand that. I hope and assume that I will be back in the future. “Genk has met me with a plan, so I am curious about how things will go in the near future.” Dessers, 25, was lively when he came off the bench for the last eighteen minutes of Nigeria’s 1-1 draw with Tunisia in a friendly that took place in Austria on October 13.
