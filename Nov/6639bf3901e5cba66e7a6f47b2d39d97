The Director of Media and Public Affairs to Ooni’s palace, Moses Olafare on Tuesday reacted to the two fake pictures of the newborn prince. Olafare disclosed that the viral pictures are misrepresenting the newly born heir to the throne of the Ooni. A statement signed by Olafare stated that the picture of the new Prince has not been released to the public. He explained that “Ooni Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, Ojaja II, who has the sole right to make the face of the baby public, is yet to do so, as essential traditional rites to formally welcome the Prince in accordance to our culture and traditions are still ongoing. “The Arole Oduduwa wishes to unequivocally and emphatically state that the pictures are not that of his son, he wants the public to ignore the social media circulation of the pictures capable of threatening the privacy of the babies in those pictures and their parents. “We urge Journalists and bloggers to always verify sources of news materials and pictures before publishing or posting to avoid ‘Invasion of Privacy’ which is an actionable offence punishable by law. “The child and mother doing perfectly well as the palace remains agog with daily jubilations and congratulatory visits,” he added.
