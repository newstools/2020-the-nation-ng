 Enyimba head coach, Fatai Osho has admitted that their CAF Champions League preliminary round opponents, Rahimo FC of Burkina Faso provide a sterner test for them in their bid to progress to the next round of the Africa’s lucrative club club competition. The People’s Elephant will next weekend face the Burkinabes in Ouagadougou in the first leg before the return leg in Aba a week later and Osho who is using the ongoing Governor Ikpeazu Pre-season Tournament in Aba to prepare his wards noted that they are expecting a tough task against Rahimo. “Where we are not doing well we have to make amends. We have to really work hard and also consider the weather too. If the weather is harsh you have to cope before you may be presented with the same scenario on the continent,” Osho said. “The opponents did very well. They moved the ball well and looked smart too. We have to commend them. There is no way one can be satisfied with the level we are. There are still lots of things to be done. We will be living in self-denial if we can’t admit that. “What we are doing is to ensure that every member of the team plays. We have over 30 players and we are rotating a lot of them. By the time we are able to see the best of them, then we will come out with the best combination. After this competition, we should be able to have a standby team and we will not necessarily rotate the team again like that.” “We have worked so hard. Prior to now we have played a lot of friendlies also and we were able to see what we ought to do. We know where we are,” Osho added. “It will be so naive of us to take Rahimo for a ride because we beat them the last time we met. We have to really work hard to beat them again. Rahimo are a very good team and in spite of the 5-1 we beat them the last time, they played very well.”
