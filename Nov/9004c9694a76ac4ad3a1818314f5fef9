The Independent Corrupt Practice and Other Related Offences Commission’s (ICPC) has ranked the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) as the most integrity-driven and ethically-compliant parastatal among 25 other regulatory agencies assessed in the anti-graft agency’s Ethics Compliance and Integrity Scorecards (ECIS), 2020. According to the ICPC’s report, which measures how Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs) of the Federal Government comply with ethical, integrity, statutory, regulatory and policy standards and requirements, the NCC came first with a score of 81.15 per cent. Trailing NCC are eight other agencies, with scores above 50 per cent. They include the Nigeria Shippers Council (NSC), 71.05 per cent); the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC), 69.85 per cent; National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission (NSIWC), 66.8 per cent; and the National Copyright Commission (NCC), 64.55 per cent in the second, third, fourth and fifth places respectively. Others are the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) with 63.55 per cent; National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) 56.4 per cent; Federal Civil Service Commission (FCSC) 54.8 per cent and the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC) 51.05 per cent. The remaining 15 regulatory agencies each scored below 50 per cent. The ranking by ICPC, in addition to demonstrating NCC’s commitment to the orderly growth and development of the Nigerian telecommunications industry, underscores the Commission’s strategic role as a key enabler of positive change within the country’s socio-economic landscape.
