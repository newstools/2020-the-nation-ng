  MINNESOTA United striker Kei Kamara has not ruled out a Sierra Leone return ahead of the Nigeria doubleheader later in the month. The Leone Stars will travel to Nigeria to honour matchday three of the African Cup of Nations qualifier at the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium in Benin City on November 13 before hosting the three-time African Champions in Freetown four days later. The fifth all-time MLS top scorer had announced an unexpected retirement on the eve of the African Cup of Nations closed doors 1-1 opener against Lesotho in November 2019 despite pressures from family and colleagues to reconsider his decision. Kamara, 36, had cited then that one of the reasons for his shock retirement was due to the lack of progress within the national team. “I can confirm that I have retired from international football because I’m unhappy with the progress of the national team,” The former Norwich and Middlesbrough forward told BBC Sport at the time. “I’ve been with the national team since 2008 and there has been no improvement, no plan for the direction the national teams should go from the youth level to senior level.” But, according to close friends, Kamara, who has 5 goals in 29 caps for the West Africans, is ready to make a U-turn and give his best to the Leone Stars.
