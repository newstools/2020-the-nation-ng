 AUSTRALIAN  defender John Harry Souttar been beaten former Super Eagles captain John Obi Mikel to the Stoke City Player of the Month  Award for October. Mikel who was among the four players nominated for the award failed to garner more votes than the Australian international defender after scooping 57% of the supporters’ poll to win the award. Souttar started his first league match for Stoke at the end of the previous month, and he has been growing from strength to strength in October. The centre half played every minute of the Stoke’s seven Championship and Carabao Cup fixtures, and in the process, helped the side to four wins, three clean sheets and a place in the last eight of the latter competition. The 22-year-old expressed to stokecityfc.com: “I think any award voted for by the fans means the most.”
