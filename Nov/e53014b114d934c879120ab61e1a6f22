The Super Eagles delayed picking their 2022 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifying ticket as they could only share points in a scoreless draw with the Leone Stars of Sierra Leone in Freetown last night. Following the dreadful  4-4 draw in Benin last Friday, the Coach Gernot Rohr-tutored side were impressive against Leone Stars at the Siaka Stevens Stadium with goalkeeper Maduka Okoye making several saves in the tie. Midfielder Oghenekaro Etebo was substituted by Shehu Abdullahi after picking up an injury in the first half of the encounter. There was little to choose from both sides in the first half as it ended goalless. However, the Eagles came out strongly in the second half but both Alex Iwobi and Kelechi  Iheanacho spurned  chances as the game dragged to the end.  Yet German coach Rohr believes the team is still on track to pick the AFCON 2021 ticket, adding he was impressed with the team’s gusty display at the Siaka Stevens Stadium in Freetown. “We saw a better solid Nigerian side and a better defensive team than last time. Our goalkeeper Maduka had a very good match. The other day he conceded four goals but that was not his fault. In today’s match, Maduka showed to everybody what he can do. The German tactician is however, not giving up on the team’s qualification for AFCON by insisting they are still in the race to pick the ticket from the group. “We are on the right track as a team and my mission is to do well all the time,” he added. The draw keeps Nigeria at the top of Group L with eight points, one more than second –placed Benin Republic, who also ended their encounter with Lesotho in Maseru scoreless. Sierra Leone stays third with three points, and Lesotho bottom of the table with two points.
