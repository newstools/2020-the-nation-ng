Sports streaming service DAZN will distribute Anthony Joshua’s heavyweight championship title defense against Kubrat Pulev on December 12, as it expands its reach internationally to more than 200 countries. The Joshua-Pulev fight, along with a December 5 Ryan Garcia-Luke Campbell clash, will lead DAZN’s global platform programming strategy which will feature classic fights, athlete features and a slate of original programming which includes 40 DAYS, Saturday Fight Live and ONE NIGHT.  DAZN, which also streams other sports like soccer, rugby and motorsports,  will provide additional sports and programming contents at the start of next year. “From the UK to Mexico to Australia, we’ve seen an encouraging level of interest in our key events since first launching in 2016,” said DAZN EVP Joseph Markowski in a statement. “We’re looking forward to introducing the DAZN platform around the world this December with an exciting schedule of fights.”
