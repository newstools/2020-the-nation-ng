BORUSSIA Dortmund striker Erling Haaland has been named the winner of the 2020 Golden Boy award. Haaland beat off competition from Barcelona forward Ansu Fati, who was runner-up, to win the award. Bayern Munich’s Alphonso Davies came third while Haaland’s Dortmund teammate Jadon Sancho took the fourth spot. Rennes’ Eduardo Camavinga came in fifth place. Juventus’ Dejan Kulusevski, Manchester City’s Phil Foden, FC Salzburg’s Dominik Szoboszlai, Arsenal’s Bukayo Saka and Real Madrid’s Vinicius Jr. completed the top 10.  A stellar list of 40 names had been released in October and included Manchester United’s Mason Greenwood and United States international Sergino Dest after an impressive breakthrough campaign at Ajax before his move to Barcelona. The award, handed out by Italian newspaper Tuttosport, honours the best young player in Europe for the calendar year. Past winners include Lionel Messi, Wayne Rooney and Kylian Mbappe, with Atletico Madrid forward Joao Felix having claimed the award last year. Haaland is the first Scandinavian player to win it.
