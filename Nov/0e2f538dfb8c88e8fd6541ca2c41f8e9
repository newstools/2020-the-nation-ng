Ochanya’s elder brother, Ameh Ejekwonyilo, gave the ultimatum on Monday in Abuja at a news conference organised by Old Girls of the Federal Government Girls’ College (FGGC), Gboko, Benue State, in collaboration with her family. Ejekwonyilo said if the ultimatum is not met by the IG, the family, FGGC Old Girls, Executive Director of Make A Difference Initiative (MAD), Mr. Lemmy Ughegbe, Executive Director of Wanda Adu Foundation, Wanda Ahe and other well-meaning individuals will storm the police headquarters to register their displeasure. He said: “More than two years after Ochanya’s death, the police have still not arrested her rapist Victor Ogbuja.
