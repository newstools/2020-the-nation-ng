YouTube will be holding its first virtual YouTube Black Africa Creators Week, between Monday 23 to Friday 27 November, a week dedicated to engaging, educating and inspiring African creators to grow on the platform. Highlights of the 1-week program include expert-led masterclasses covering topics like assessing channel performance and engaging a community, and understanding YouTube’s monetisation policies, among others. The programme also includes a creator spotlight talk with Mark Angel, Africa’s most subscribed endemic creator, YouTube training courses, and peer-driven open conversations aimed at improving creator collaboration and knowledge sharing. YouTube will also celebrate creators through the presentation of Play Button awards to Dodos Uvieghara, Eric Okafor, and Kay Ngonyama whose channels have crossed the 100,000 subscriber milestone. This region-wide virtual initiative, says Alex Okosi, MD, Emerging Markets, YouTube EMEA, demonstrates YouTube’s commitment to creators and artists in the region. “Over the years we have built and nurtured strong relationships with Africa’s storytellers, and provided them with a platform to share their stories with the world,” says Okosi. “Top African creators and channels like Mark Angel Comedy, DJ Arch Jnr, Churchill Show and many others have grown from a handful of followers to having millions of fans globally. “We remain committed to amplifying Black voices and providing a platform where Black African creators can thrive,” Okosi says.
