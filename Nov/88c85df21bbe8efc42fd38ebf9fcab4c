Applicants of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) 2019/2020 recruitment exercise have called on the Corporation to release its recruitment list. The applicants, in a statement, appealed to the National Assembly to prevail on NNPC to release the list of successful ‘Experienced Hires’ candidates for the 2019/2020 recruitment exercise. The Nation learnt in March 2019, NNPC under the leadership of the late Dr. Maikanti Baru, placed a public advert for ‘Graduate Trainees’ and ‘Experienced Hires’. The applicants wrote the test while the successful ones among them were invited for interviews in July 2019 for the Graduate trainees and Experienced Hires. The Nation also learnt the successful ‘Graduate Trainees’ resumed work virtually in May 2020 but nothing has been heard about the successful ‘Experienced Hires’. But the Corporation, in a statement earlier this year, noted that it had concluded the whole recruitment exercise. The applicants under the ‘Experienced Hires’ category while demanding fairness, urged the Corporation to release the list of successful candidates for the 400 vacant positions advertised. According to them: “NNPC should immediately and meritoriously release the list of the successful Experienced Hires candidates of the 2019/2020 recruitment exercise for the 400 vacancies to enable them to resume work just like they did for the Graduate trainees. “As we speak some of the Experienced Hires candidates who have been waiting have lost their jobs and COVID-19 pandemic is biting hard on us.”
