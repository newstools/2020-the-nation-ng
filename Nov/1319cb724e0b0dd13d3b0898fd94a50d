 The Organisation of Women in Science for Developing World (OWSD), Lagos Branch, has held the grand finale of its debate contest with experts stressing the need to encourage more girls to study science courses for the nation to be able to fully actualise her potentials. The event was part of the activities to mark the International Year for Women and Girls in Science and had as  its theme : “Investment in women and girls in science for green growth: A necessity for Nigeria.” Speaking on the occasion, the Deputy Vice Chancellor, Management, University of Lagos (UNILAG),Prof. Folasade Ogunsola, who represented the Vice Chancellor, Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, said the theme was apt for a country like Nigeria which is slowly recognising that a bird cannot fly with only one wing. “ The perspective, creativity and pragmatism that women bring to bear in science cannot be ignored by any country that is interested in developing rapidly and taking a significant place among the comity of nations in the 21st Century,” she said. Ogunsola expressed satisfaction that despite the challenges brought about by the advent of COVID-19, over 2,500 students still took part in the competition. The President, OWSD, Lagos Branch, Prof. Joy Okpuzor, said the 10 finalists emerged from a team of promising  pupils who would do the nation proud in  future.
