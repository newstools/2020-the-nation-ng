Kwara All Progressives Congress (APC) said it remains very solid in the state. APC added the former Senate President Bukola Saraki cannot pose any threat to the party in the state. APC chair Hon Bashir Bolarinwa spoke in Ilorin, the state capital at a prayer organised in honour of late Governor Mohammed Lawal. Bolarinwa made veiled reference to the triumphant entry of Saraki to the state capital on Saturday since his defeat at the poll in 2019 general elections. During the visit, Saraki’s supporters, associates and loyalists trooped out en masse to welcome him back home. He said: “Let me say this for all to hear. We are not disallowing anybody from entering the state. “We know that Saraki can no longer pose any threat to APC in the state. “God that was with us yesterday is forever with us. Our members have no reason to entertain any fear. “Saraki’s domination of Kwara political landscape is gone for good.” Speaking on the life and time of late Lawal, the former House of Representatives member urged people in position of authority to always know that power is transient. “The legacy of late Governor Lawal is still speaking for him. Late Lawal was an embodiment of good work. ” This goes to tell us that our positions, accomplishments are for the betterment of the less heeled in the society. It is what the holy books admonish us to do. “I therefore urge us all especially the well-to-do to always spare a thought for the less privileged in our midst,” Bolarinwa added. A chieftain of APC in the state Chief Rex Olaoye dismissed the reported removal of Bolarinwa by some members loyal to Governor AbdulRaman Abdulrazaq as a huge joke. Olaoye said the APC would complete his term without any interruption. “The governor has sounded it loud and clear that he did not have a hand in the purported removal Hon Bolarinwa. Bolarinwa remains our chair in the state. No more no less,” the APC stalwart said.
