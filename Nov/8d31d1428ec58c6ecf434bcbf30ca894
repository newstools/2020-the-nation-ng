 DANIEL Akpeyi conceded three times as Kaizer Chiefs suffered a 3-0 defeat to arch-rivals Orlando Pirates in the first leg of their MTN 8 semi-final clash on Saturday. It was Akpeyi’s second game of the season after making his first appearance and keeping a clean sheet in the win over Chippa United. However, it was a bad day at the office for him in the Soweto Derby played on Saturday as Pirates ran riot at the Orlando Stadium. Zakhele Lepasa put the Buccaneers ahead in the 26th minute, heading past Akpeyi following a cross from Terrence Dzvukamanja. Maliele Pule then doubled Pirates lead in the 67th minute, firing a low shot past Akpeyi. Thembinkosi Lorch’s strike nine minutes from time made it three. The result means Pirates take a commanding lead to the Moses Mabhida Stadium ahead of the second leg next weekend. But before then, both teams have a league match to navigate with Chiefs hosting TS Galaxy on Wednesday, while Pirates travel to Bloemfontein Celtic the same day.
