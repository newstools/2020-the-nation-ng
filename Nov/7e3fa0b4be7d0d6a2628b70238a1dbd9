The People Democratic Party (PDP) South Africa chapter has advised federal and state governments to make findings of the panels of Enquiry on #EndSARS protests public. The recommendations, it said, should also be properly addressed and implemented. Chairman and Secretary of PDP South Africa chapter, Ekos Akpokabayen and Emeka Ugwu respectively in a statement commended efforts to set up the panels to look into the immediate and remotes causes of the attendant mayhem, loss of lives, and other issues that arose during the ENDSAR protest. The party said it was of utmost importance the various panels were given free access to all that they may need to assist them to do their jobs unhindered and without political interference. “We have watched with keen interest, various political developments in Nigeria, in the recent past. The demonstration by the Nigerian youths, across various states of the federation, pushing for an end to the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, gained tremendous international and local attention”. “We salute the astuteness, and gallantry of the Nigerian youths, for taking the bull by the horn and exercising their democratic right, as enshrined in the Nigerian constitutions,” the party said. The chapter condemned the alleged use of live ammunition by security forces on protesters in Lekki while commiserating with families and friends of those that lost their lives.
