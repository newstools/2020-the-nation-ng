Two repentant bandit leaders, Sale Turwa and Muhammed Sani Maidaji have had a change of heart in Katsina State, pledging not to engage in any form of criminality anymore. They surrendered 10 AK47 rifles to Governor Aminu Masari on Wednesday evening during a meeting with heads of security agencies. The repentant bandits were presented to Masari by the state Commissioner of Police Sanusi Buba and his counterparts from the 17 Brigade, Katsina, Department of State Security and the Civil Defense Corps Buba earlier told Governor Masari that it was the view of security chiefs in the state that he accept the bandits’ remorse and forgive them in order to encourage other bandits to follow suit. While describing the development as a very significant milestone in the fight against banditry and other criminalities, Governor Masari urged the security operatives not to relent in their efforts. He said “I’ve instructed the security operatives to deal ruthlessly with the bandits until they are rendered permanently ineffective. “We are no more going to negotiate with them, but if on their volition they decide to renounce their violent criminal ways and embrace peace, we are ready to listen to them’’. “Even then, they must surrender all the arms and ammunition in their possession, otherwise they remain enemies to be dealt with accordingly, as far as we are concerned.”
