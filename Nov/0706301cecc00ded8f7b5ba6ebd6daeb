 THE Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) on Tuesday declared that there are no cases of COVID-19 inside the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) camps. Its Director-General, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, who stated this during a television programme in Abuja, explained that the cases detected were those discovered before they entered the NYSC camp after thorough screening. He said: “Now, we are in the middle of reopening youth services camps in the country, which has been an incredibly extensive logistics exercise. We are by no means out of the woods and there have been spikes in other countries. “I saw a bit of reporting about cases in NYSC camps. It is important to clarify that there have been no cases inside NYSC camps. “To reopen camps, we started working with NYSC and prepared for months for this. We are screening every single person coming back to the youth service camp. For this first stream, there are over 45,000 people – both youth corps members and members of NYSC camp community.” The NCDC boss added: “So, before you get into camp, you are screened. So, it is through that screening process naturally that we have picked a few cases across the country. People coming back cannot know they are infected themselves, but are being tested, identified and then excluded from the camp. They are then appropriately isolated and managed.
