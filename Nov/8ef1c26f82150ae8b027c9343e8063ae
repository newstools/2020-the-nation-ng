Kogi State Government has queried the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Usman Ibrahim, over last week’s report of a purported levy introduced by the government on bread from outside the state. In a letter signed by the Head of Service (HOS), Mrs. Deborah Ogunmola, the affected official was directed to respond to the query within 24 hours to show why disciplinary action should not be taken against him for gross misconduct. It said the official on November 9 signed a letter addressed to the chairman, Association of Master Bakers and Caterers of Nigeria (AMBCN), Kogi State branch, on the subject of introducing an identified consulting company and levies on bread to all bakers and caterers doing business across the state. The letter said investigation showed that the official acted without obtaining the approval of the commissioner and could not provide any file documenting the approval for the dissemination of such information. The HOS said despite the official’s denial, his actions contravened Public Service Rules, Section 4 – 030402 (1), (N) and (o). The government had last Friday debunked reports that the said levy on master bakers was novel, saying it had been in existence, and now about to be enforced. The law, according to the Commissioner for Information and Communication, Kingsley Fanwo, is targeted at bakers from outside the state, who bring in the commodity without paying.
