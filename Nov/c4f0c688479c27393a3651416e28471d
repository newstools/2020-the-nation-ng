 A POLITICAL group within the All Progressives Congress (APC), United Kingdom (UK), Mandate International, on Sunday condemned arsonists, who hijacked the peaceful protest against police brutality in Nigeria. The group condemned the violence that trailed the protest, saying that it was counter-productive. According to the group, the attack on APC National Leader Asiwaju Bola Tinubu was wrong, stressing that the virtuperation was misdirected. Mandate International UK, in a statement by its coordinator, Ibrahim Yusuf, said although the protest was popular, hoodlums hijacked it to wreck havoc on the country. He said: “It is condemnable to think that some hoodlums either sponsored or otherwise will take such an action against a great man like Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu who has built bridges and made people across the land and has never relented in doing so. Asiwaju has done all within his power to ensure he delivers the best at all times. “At Mandate International UK, we urge those who are planning to bring the political strongman down to have a rethink, Tinubu will not succumb, he remains the rally point for Lagos and Nigeria politics at large”. Yusuf urged social media influencers exercise caution, noting that their resort to propaganda heralded the unwarranted disaster in Lagos and other cities across the country. He also said the destruction of public institutions, including Nigeria Port Authority (NPA), was surprising and condemnable.
