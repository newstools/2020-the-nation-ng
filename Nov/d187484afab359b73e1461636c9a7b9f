 TWO -TIME CBN champions Sarah Adegoke is determined to reclaim her women ‘s singles title from holder, Oyinlomo Quadri even as the apex bank pledged its continuous support  for  the annual tennis tournament which got underway in Abuja on Monday. Adegoke lost the opportunity to reclaim her crown for the third consecutive time following her none participation in the 2019 edition won by  Oyinlomo. Adegoke who  is back in action after being away due to  her  quest for professional stint,  is indeed optimistic of her chances of dethroning her younger professional colleague. She said: “To play her, (Oyinlomo Quadri) will be very interesting, it’s something I am looking forward to. “She is a very young player who has been doing very well this couple of years. Honestly I adore her game on and off the court. “Sharing a court with her sometime soon will be a dream come true for me because right now, she is really hot and on fire and I love playing those on fire”.
