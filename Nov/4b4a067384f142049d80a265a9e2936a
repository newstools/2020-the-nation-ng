 BENUE State Supervisory Commissioner for Health Dr. Godwin Oyiwona says cases of Yellow Fever disease have been reported in three local governments. He disclosed this on Monday at the launch of vaccination against Yellow Fever in Makurdi. Oyiwona said the disease, which had killed about 20 people so far in Ogbadibo, has now spread to Okpokwu and Ado local governments.. He noted that the rapid spread of the disease in the state required immediate remedial measures to control it. According to him, the vaccination was an antidote against its spread to other parts of the state. He said: “The launch is to cover 20 local government areas of the state, aside the three local governments that were covered last year. “Yellow Fever was discovered in Ogbadibo Local Government recently and it has spread to Okpokwu and Ado local government areas. “This has prompted the state government to swing into action to see that people are vaccinated against the disease. “We need to see that every person from nine months to 44 years come for vaccination.” Governor Samuel Ortom, who launched the vaccination exercise,  urged local government council chairmen, traditional rulers and religious organisations to join hands in the campaign to have everyone vaccinated. While commending the state for its polio-free status, Ortom said his administration had released N29 million for the completion of the permanent site for the Primary Health Care Board, adding that another N10 million was released as counterpart funding for logistics.
