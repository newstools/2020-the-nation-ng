TOTTENHAM have announced plans for 2,000 fans to attend the north London derby against Arsenal on 6 December. Spurs are one of 10 Premier League sides in tier two areas, where up to 2,000 people are allowed at outdoor sports venues after lockdown in England ends on 2 December. The other 10 teams are all in tier three, where no fans are allowed. Spurs said they will allocate the tickets via a ballot for season-ticket holders and executive members only.  It will be the first match in front of spectators at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium since the FA Cup fifth-round game against Norwich on 4 March. Liverpool have also set out their plans for 2,000 fans to watch their Premier League match against Wolves at Anfield on the same day. Supporters will all be seated in the main stand, and the ballot will only be open to fans who live in the Liverpool City Region â€“ an area that covers the boroughs of Liverpool, Halton, Knowsley, Sefton, St Helens and Wirral. Applicants must be season-ticket holders or members with at least 19 credits from the 2018-19 Premier League campaign.
