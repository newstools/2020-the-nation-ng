 LEICESTER City head into their latest Premier League outing after an impressive 1-0 away victory over Arsenal, the Foxes’ first win over the Gunners in north London for 47 years and a 2-1 UEFA Europa League win at AEK Athens. The result in London initially moved Leicester up to fourth in the Premier League table, before this weekend’s action, two points ahead of today’s opponents, Leeds, in their maiden season in the top flight since 2004. Speaking to LCFC TV, Kelechi Iheanacho praised Leicester City’s performance at both ends of the pitch at Emirates Stadium. “It was a tough game, we knew what Arsenal would be like and we were stronger in our defensive structure,” the Nigerian international reflected. “We did a great job of defending deep and on the counter attacks, we did very well and we got a goal and three points, so that’s all we need. “I think it was a great game, the whole squad was on it, everyone did very well and our away games have been good so I think we’ll keep doing that and keep trying to get there.” City have won all three of their away fixtures so far this campaign, also seeing off newly promoted West Bromwich Albion and six-time champions Manchester City. Iheanacho has put that form down to the positive mindset within the group and their willingness to work for each other and follow the game plan set by manager Brendan Rodgers. He added: “Of course two games every week, it’s not that easy, so sometimes you have tired legs. But it’s good to recover very well to be able to play in this game. “So I think having to play on Monday will be a very, very good idea and it will help us to recover, having three days to prepare for the game, so the squad can be ready to face Leeds.”
