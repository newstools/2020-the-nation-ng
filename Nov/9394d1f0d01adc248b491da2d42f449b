 OYO State Governor Seyi Makinde has paid N2.9 billion to 1,800  retirees  to offset the  backlog of gratuities owed pensioners between June 2019 and September 2020. The Commissioner for Establishment and Training, Prof. Daud Sangodoyin who represented the governor, spoke during the presentation of cheques to the tune of N180 million as gratuities to 91 retirees in Ibadan. He said Governor Makinde’s administration releases N180 million monthly, for the payment of retirees entitlements to offset the backlog of gratuities. He further stated that Governor Makinde had set up a committee headed by the Secretary to the State Government, Mrs Olubanwo Adeosun, to look into modalities of improving payment of the backlog so that retirees could get their money during their lifetime. He said that N180 million that was paid this October covered June 2013 retirees. He pointed out that any retiree who has not gotten his or her gratuity had either not submitted papers up to that point. He said “From our own Ministry of Establishment and Training, we take care of the teachers, non-teachers, civil servants, the local government commission, as well as judicial service commission staff, which is about N28 billion now, that we are owing. If you look at it from the whole Oyo State, we have almost N64 billion gratuity to settle for all the workers in Oyo State,” he said. He called on retirees not to bribe any government officials for assistance to Fastrack payment of their gratuities. He said: “Attempts to bribe any government officials for assistance to fastrack payment of gratuities would be a waste. The present administration is open and will not engage in sharp practices or deal. “Welfarism is the cardinal point of the Makinde administration and the governor has been diligent in the payment of gratuity of the state retirees since he assumed office”. He urged the beneficiaries to spend the money judiciously and abstain from reckless and irrational spending.
