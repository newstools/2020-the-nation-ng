The Association of Resident Doctors at the Ondo State University of Medical Sciences Teaching Hospital (UNIMEDTH) on Monday began indefinite strike over non-payment of four months’ salary. Legal officers at the Ministry of Justice, under the auspices of Law Officers Association of Nigeria (LOAN), also withdrew their services over what they termed worsening despicable and deplorable conditions they were subjected to. Last week, the UNIMEDTH ARD embarked on a three-day warning strike with a threat to totally down tools if their demands were not met. Acting ARD President, Ondo State chapter, Dr. Sanni Oriyomi, told reporters in Akure that they could no longer pretend that all was well. He said besides the non-payment of salaries, there were also issues of dearth of doctors and house officers. Oriyomi said the COVID-19 hazard allowance was paid for only one month and that the resident doctors sought accommodation for themselves instead of living in houses provided by the management. He said the absence of house officers is affecting the health of his members. Oriyomi said: “Having persevered to render services, our salary has become issue of concern. We are finding it difficult to meet up with our financial obligations. “We urge the government to come up with a solution. It’s not in our interest to embark on this strike, but enough is enough.” Ondo ARD spokesman Dr. Taiwo Olaigbe said the state health system was on the brink of collapse. He said they will not return to work until their salaries are paid. The legal officers, in a statement by their Chairman, Babatunde Victor Falodun and Secretary, Wale Banisile, addressed to Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, said the work-to-rule action would persist until their demands were met.
