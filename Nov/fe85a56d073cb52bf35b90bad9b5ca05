 TWO weeks after the resumption of students of Federal College of Education, Pankshin, for their academic activities, the Provost, Dr Amos Cirfat, has declared that the institution is yet to record any case of COVID-19 from the students and staff of the college. According to him, no student or employee has shown any sign or symptom of the virus in the institution. Cirfat made this known on Friday in chat with the Nation in his office in the Pankshin Local Government Area, Plateau State. The provost said: “So far, we haven’t received any report of ill health regarding COVID-19 in the two weeks that our students have been on campus for academic activities.” “I can confidently tell you that with the measures taken by the college management coupled with students’ cooperation, there is no cause for alarm. “We are equally at alert, especially in our clinic where all is set for any eventuality. The staff there operate a 24- hour service. “Our hope is that the next set (400 Level and NCE III students) expected on November. 23 will not bring any issue either. If we will continue like this, then we will be able to succeed as a college and achieve academic excellence.” Cirfat said that “the college has a COVID-19 committee that has been working tirelessly to ensure that all measures are put in place within the college”. According to him, the lockdown negatively affected the college as the examinations and payment of fees couldn’t be completed before the closure. The provost further said: “In spite of the financial implication, we made sure the entire college was fumigated. Soaps and water were placed in strategic places as part of measures to keep safe.” “Our hope is that the students should continue to comply with the COVID-19 protocols and equally cooperate with our security and staff for us to enjoy a virus-free atmosphere for academic excellence”.
