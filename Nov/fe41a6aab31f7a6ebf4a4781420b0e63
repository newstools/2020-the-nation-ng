  As part of its contributions to the development of its host communities, BUA Cement, one of Africa’s largest cement companies, has donated six units of 500KVA transformers to boost access to electricity in Okpella Community of Edo State. The company also provided two security patrol vehicles to security agencies within the community. Speaking on the donations, the Managing Director/CEO of BUA Cement Plc., Engr. Yusuf Binji, said BUA Cement’s social responsibility was a critical part of the BUA Cement DNA and as a result, it was committed to the development of host communities wherever it operates. He said the six units of 500KVA transformers will ease the burden of access to electricity currently being experienced in Okeplla and promised that BUA will also install the transformers on the community’s behalf. On the security vehicles, Binji noted that this will help boost the capacity of the security agencies within the community to provide a more secure environment for the residents and businesses in Okpella.  Binji said: “Our commitment to sustainability, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and sustainable business practices will remain critical to our business at BUA Cement.” “We will keep pursuing an inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable environment. CSR is how we colour the lives of those around us.” BUA had last year provided six solar powered boreholes in various communities across Okpella.
