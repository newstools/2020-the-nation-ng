  Abia State Governor Okezie Ikpeazu has promised to reward outstanding corps members. He also reiterated his administration’s readiness to make the atmosphere conducive for corps members to serve. Ikpeazu spoke yesterday during the swearing in of the 2020 ‘Batch B Stream 1A’ corps members at the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) permanent orientation camp in Umunna, Bende Local Government Area. About six hundred and eighty nine corps members were sworn in. The governor, represented by Commissioner for Youth and Sports Development Emeka Ikwuagwu, noted that his administration had recently offered automatic employment to two ex-corps members and rewarded five members of the 2019 Batch ‘B’ and ‘C’ for their contributions to the state’s development.  He said: “Abia is noted for her industry and entrepreneurial spirit, and I urge you to pay attention to the skills acquisition and entrepreneurial programme that will be introduced to you during this orientation course. The acquisition of these skills will go a long way in shaping your future and give you access to getting soft loans to establish your own business.” NYSC State Coordinator Lady Bona Fasakin lauded Ikpeazu and his wife for rehabilitating facilities at the camp. She assured corps members, parents and guardians of the scheme’s readiness to ensure a COVID-19 hitch free orientation course. Cross River State Governor Ben Ayade welcomed 600 corps members for the orientation course. Ayade, who was represented by the Commissioner for Youth Development and Skills Acquisition; and Chairman, NYSC Governing Board Signor Idiege, urged the corps members to focus on national consciousness and integration. “Despite our collective challenges as a country, Nigeria remains a strong entity full of opportunities especially for the educated youths,” he noted.
