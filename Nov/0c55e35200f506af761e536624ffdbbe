The All Progressives Congress (APC) on Wednesday said the party will soon shock Nigerians with the sheer number of persons that would soon defect to the party. The Chairman, Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the APC, Mai Mala Buni gave this indication during a meeting with the party caucus in the Senate in Abuja. “Today, we are proud to say that the conflicts in most, if not all of the states have been settled. The party now proudly parade political heavyweights in their respective states that have either returned to the party or freshly joined the party. “We have the former Speaker of the House of Representatives Hon. Yakubu Dogara, Former PDP National Chairman, Senator Barnabas Gemade, several members of the National Assembly, Chief Jimoh Ibrahim, former Head of service of the federation, Mr. Danladi Kifasi, Sen. Isa Hamma Misau, Alhaji Salisu Takai among others. “Our recent big catch of a very no less personality than the Executive Governor of Ebonyi state, His Excellency Mr. Dave Umahi and several legislators of the state assembly are indeed great milestones in our restoration process. Many others have indicated interest to either return or join the party. “In fact, I want to assure you all that APC will soon shock Nigeria’s political space with massive and unprecedented defections ever witnessed in the political history of our great country, and by the grace of God, APC will undoubtedly remain Nigeria’s leading political party,” Buni said.
