Suspected kidnappers have abducted the wife and son of a security aide of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar. The kidnappers were believed to have gone for the security aide, an unnamed policeman, but took his wife and son when they did not find him. The incident happened on Monday night in Yolde-Pate, Yola, when the target was believed to still be around after reportedly accompanying Atiku to the town over the weekend, sources said on Wednesday. “The kidnappers believed that the police personnel, being so close to Atiku, would have money, so they went for him but took his wife and son when they did not find him,” the source said. Our correspondent also learnt Wednesday morning that a brother of one of the state lawmakers was abducted about the same time elsewhere in Adamawa State. Police spokesman Suleiman Nguroje confirmed the two abductions.
