 GOING by the record of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 Control, the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) have received N50 billion to boost the fight against the spread of the virus in their domains. PTF National Coordinator Dr. Sani Aliyu, who broke the news yesterday during a media briefing in Abuja, however, appealed to the states to apply the resources released to them for the purposes they were given. According to him, the least each of the states had received as support for the fight against COVID-19 was N1 billion, pointing out that the states have the financial wherewithal to effectively push back Coronavirus spread. Dr. Aliyu said: “We have given resources to state governments; every state has received at least a billion (naira), the state governments have received the largest single bulk of the PTF. “As of today, a total of N50 billion went to states. So, we have enough resources at the state level to be able to push for increased testing and improved surveillance. “We will continue to work with states government and urge them to use these resources for the purpose that the federal government has given. “We have to invest in making sure that the pandemic comes down. There is no doubt we have not flattened the curve yet. For those of us that follow the numbers very closely, despite the fact that we are not testing enough, if you follow the number on a week to week basis, you would have noticed a change in the trajectory in the last one week based on the numbers released.”
