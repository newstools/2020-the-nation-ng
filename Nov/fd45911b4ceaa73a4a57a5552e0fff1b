Lagos State will continue to enforce its traffic laws to maintain sanity on roads and save lives, Commissioner for Information and Strategy Gbenga Omotoso said on Wednesday. This, he said, is to halt the resurgence of impunity and violation of traffic regulations. A statement by Omotoso reads: “Amid the enforcement, which began on Tuesday, commercial motorcyclists have taken laws into their hands and attacked the Task Force team, injuring officers carrying out their lawful duties. The perpetrators of this violence will be identified and made to face the law. “However, 131 motorcycles were seized; 15 riders arrested and prosecuted; and 150 vehicles impounded in various areas of the state. The Task Force subsequently arraigned and prosecuted 35 drivers of impounded vehicles, who had to forfeit their cars to the state for driving against oncoming traffic; 62 drivers who plied the BRT Corridor were fined N70,000 each; and 28 tricycle owners were also arraigned in court. “The Task Force was again attacked in Ikeja yesterday and the team retreated to avoid an escalation of the crisis. The team, however, mobilised more personnel to quell the riots started by the riders. “Traffic enforcement agencies will continue to assert their authority. They have been directed to arraign and prosecute all violators to ensure that penalties are apportioned in consonance with the law. “Commercial motorcycles and tricycles remain restricted from operating in six local governments and nine Local Council Development Areas – Apapa; Lagos Mainland; Surulere; Ikeja; Eti-Osa; Lagos Island; Onigbongbo; Ojodu LCDA; Ikoyi-Obalende LCDA; Iru-Victoria Island LCDA; Lagos Island East LCDA; Apapa-Iganmu LCDA; Yaba LCDA; Itire-Ikate LCDA; and Coker-Aguda LCDA. “Government will continue to dialogue with stakeholders in the transportation sector – NURTW, RTEAN, ANACOWA, TOOAN, TODAL and MOALS – to restore sanity on Lagos roads and halt the disregard for the Lagos Traffic Law (2018).”
