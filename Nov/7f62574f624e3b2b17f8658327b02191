Eight hundred and sixty one employees of the Lagos State public service were at weekend honoured with the 2020 long service merit awards. Head of Service (HOS) Hakeem Muri-Okunola urged them to maintain their good attitude to work and perform their job efficiently, to further the successful implementation of the THEMES agenda of the current administration. At the event held at Adeyemi Bero Auditorium, Alausa, Ikeja, the HOS said the occasion presented the opportunity to celebrate public servants who had served the state meritoriously in the last 30 years and above, with the hope that the gesture would encourage the awardees and others to continue to put in their best. “The objective of the annual award ceremony, as you know, is the conscious and deliberate celebration of diligence, commitment, hard work and loyalty among public servants in Lagos State as a way of expressing government’s appreciation and gratitude to select members of its workforce,” he added. Muri-Okunola enjoined the awardees not to rest on their oars, but should continue to exhibit high sense of responsibility and commitment to duty. Secretary to the State Government (SSG) Mrs. Folashade Jaji thanked the recipients, saying the government should celebrate those that had served the state meritoriously in the last 30 years and above. The recipients included the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Information, Mr. Olusina Thorpe; and his Establishment and Training counterpart, Mr. Bamgboye Abiodun.
