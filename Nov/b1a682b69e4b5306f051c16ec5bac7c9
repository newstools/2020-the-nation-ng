 It is no longer news that the Federal High Court sitting in Yenagoa has disqualified the candidate of All Progressives Congress (APC) in Bayelsa West Senatorial District, Peremobowei Ebebi, from contesting the forthcoming by-election in the state. What is intriguing is rather than unite and find how the party will not end up without a candidate in the all-important election, chieftains of the troubled state chapter are busy trading blame. Sentry gathered that following the judgement, which threatens to bar APC from participating in the poll, the camp of Ebebi has been at war with other prominent groups within the party over what they called unending attempts to stop the former deputy governor from clinching the vacant senate seat. According to reliable party sources, supporters of Ebebi have been accusing a former governorship aspirant of sponsoring the court case that led to the judgement. Consequently, the two camps have resumed their brickbats while the chances of the party featuring in the election, hang in the balance. The court had ruled that the academic credentials and voter’s card which Ebebi submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for the by-election were forged documents. The governorship candidate of APC during November 16, 2019 governorship election in Bayelsa suffered the same fate when Supreme Court voided his election due to the discrepancies in his running mate’s academic credentials barely a day to his swearing-in February. Ebebi won the direct primary election conducted in September by the party. Unless the APC finds a way of turning the current situation in Bayelsa West around, it will be twice bitten, not shy for the party in the state.
