 In the early days of 2020, MTN launched Y’ello Star after resting popular music reality TV show, Project Fame. During the launch, the telco noted that the main motive is to groom musical talent by providing a lifetime opportunity to turn their dreams and aspirations into reality. However, the coronavirus pandemic delayed activities slated for the commencement of the music reality TV show. While the pandemic ravaged the world, organisers of Y’hello Star decided to take it a step further by requesting support and partnership from renowned music institution, Berklee College of Music. Investigations conducted by The Nation revealed that the partnership Berklee College of Music for Y’ello Star will provide contestants and eventual winner artistry collaboration in terms of performing, producing, and writing.  Aside from being home to music impresario and legend, Quincy Jones, the world’s premier learning lab for music also has Charlie Puth as alumni. The winner of the show stands the opportunity of learning alongside faculty and artists who continually reshape the music industry. The winner will interact with active producers, songwriters, performers, entrepreneurs, and engineers who are dedicated to cultivating the next generation of industry leaders. Speaking on the collaboration, Berklee President Roger H. Brown said, “We’re excited to work with MTN and Afrinolly Creative Hub on the Y’ello Star Project. This is a great opportunity for artists from the vibrant Nigerian music scene to get advice and mentorship from Berklee’s knowledgeable professors while broadening awareness of Berklee in the region through MTN’s large audience. We look forward to hearing all of the talents and welcoming the winner to the Power Station at BerkleeNYC.”
