 The Police Service Commission (PSC) has denied that it threatened to dismiss any police officer who failed to return to work in the wake of the #EndSARS protests. Head, Press and Public Relations of the Commission, Ikechukwu Ani, in a statement on Saturday, said they condemned the killing of Police officers on legitimate duties and had warned that any attempt to make the country lawless will be an ill wind that will blow no body any good. “The Commission can only plead with the officers to, in the spirit of nationalism, return to work while the government works out enough protective programmes for them. The Commission will continue to do its best to ensure the police are motivated to do its job. “The Commission, being the employers of the Police, is pained that Policemen were killed and Police Stations set ablaze throughout the country. It will be very insensitive at this point for anyone to say that the Commission will dismiss any policeman who didn’t return to work. The Commission is even at present mourning the deaths of its gallant officers who were killed in the crisis,” Ani said.
