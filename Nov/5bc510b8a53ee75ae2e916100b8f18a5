Super Eagles defender Ola Aina showed his scoring prowess by scoring a sensational goal to mark his first for Fulham in their 2-0 win against West Brom in the English Premier League (EPL) match ahead of 2022 African Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifiers against Sierra Leone next week. Aina who has been listed in Coach Gernot Rohr 24-man team was named in the starting line up by Fulham manager Scott Parker as they aimed to halt their winless streak in the league after a 1-2 home loss to Crystal Palace in their last outing. Fulham striker Aleksandar Mitrovic teed-up Aina who sent a thunderbolt past West Brom goalie Sam Johnstone in the 29th minute; with compatriot Semi Ajayi helpless in West Brom’s defence. Four minutes earlier, Mitrovic had earlier provided a cushioned header which allowed Bobby De Cordova-Reid nod Fulham ahead following Antonee Robinson’s cross.  The Chelsea Academy product joined the Cottagers on a season-long loan from Serie A outfit Torino.
