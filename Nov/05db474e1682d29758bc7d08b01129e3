  The Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences (Enforcement) Unit (Taskforce) has denied that the uniformed men with the agency’s Black Maria in a viral video circulating on social media are not its operatives. A statement issued by agency’s Head of Public Affairs Unit, Taofiq Adebayo, said ‘’the uniformed men on the viral video were not operatives of the Agency as none of them had on any jacket with an inscription ‘Lagos State Task Force’ which is our official outfit during any enforcement operations.”  He said those uniformed men in the said viral video only used the Agency’s Black Maria to convey arrested miscreants and hoodlums to court as directed by the Lagos State Police Command. “The Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences (Enforcement) Unit (Taskforce) therefore, enjoined members of the public not to attach the said viral video to any activities of the Agency. ”The Agency is, however, undeterred and highly committed to ridding the State of all criminal elements”, the statement reads.
