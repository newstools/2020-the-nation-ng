 THE Nigerian Army says it has killed 75 Boko Haram and ISWAP terrorists. The terrorists were routed by troops of Operation Fireball, a subsidiary of Operation Lafiya Dole. Briefing journalists at Ngamdu Special Super Camp 1, Nigeria Army yesterday, Ag. Director, Defence Media Operations Brig.-Gen. Bernard Onyeuko said troops launched many offensive operations on terrorist targets within the theatre of engagement over a short period of timeterrorists. Onyeuko said one officer and two soldiers died in the operations. “The Operation has recorded tremendous succeses within the short period of its existence…The troops in the various sectors of the theatre have continued to carry out their tasks relentlessly. The successes so far achieved wouldn’t have been possible without the sacrifice, commitment and gallantry exhibited by the well-motivated troops some of whom have paid the supreme sacrifice. Within this period, the troops have carried out aggressive clearance operations, ambushes; robust day and night patrols in order to finally decimate the remnants of the Boko Haram/ISWAP criminals. “Consequently, as a result of the aggressive offensive action carried out by the troops, several terrorist elements have been neutralised as large numbers of their equipment were captured while some were equally destroyed in the process. In this regard a total of 75 Boko Haram/ISWAP terrorists were neutralised within this period. “Regrettably, one officer and two gallant soldiers paid the supreme price while four other soldiers were wounded in action over the period. However, the wounded soldiers have since been evacuated to a military medical facility and are currently responding to treatment.”
