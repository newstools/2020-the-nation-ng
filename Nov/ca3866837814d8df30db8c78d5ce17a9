 THE strike force of the Nigeria Customs Service, Zone B, has seized assorted contraband and counterfeit goods valued at N139.7 million. The seizures were made in various border locations in the northern states of the country, officials said. Deputy Controller-General in charge of Zone B, Kano/Jigawa Command, Olorukoba Ussaini Aliyu, said the intensified interception of smuggled and contraband items was as a result of increased unpatriotic activities of smugglers who are bent on sabotaging the nationâ€™s economy. Among the confiscated items displayed were 745 bags of parboiled foreign rice, two vehicles, 622 bales and three sacks of secondhand clothing, 564 kegs of vegetable oil, 258 cartons of tomatoes paste and 208 parcels of Cannabis Sativa. Other seized goods included 821 cartons of foreign spaghetti noodles, 35 cartons of Mosquito coil, 370 kegs of 25 litres of Petroleum Motor Spirit (PMS).
