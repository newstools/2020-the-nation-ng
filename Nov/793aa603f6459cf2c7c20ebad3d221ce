Now that the 2020/21 season has begun the race for the European Golden Shoe has started. Ciro Immobile won the 2019/20 European Golden Shoe, scoring 36 goals for Lazio in a tremendous Serie A season. Robert Lewandowski, who only missed out on the prize last season due to the magnificent scoring exploits of Immobile, has taken an early lead in 2020/21. At this stage of the season, the leagues that run on the calendar year 2020   inevitably get a head start but these days with the league weightings, very few are still there by the end of the traditional 2020/21 campaign. It should be noted that the five elite leagues – Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A and Ligue 1 – all carry a weighting of 2, meaning that a player will be awarded two points for every goal they score in these competitions. For the leagues ranked sixth to 30 in UEFA ‘s coefficients rankings goals scored are given a weighting of 1.5, and goals scored in a league out with the top 30, goals are given a weighting of 1. Meanwhile, Premier League pair Heung-min Son and Dominic Calvert-Lewin have enjoyed superb starts to their domestic campaigns, too, scoring eight goals respectively so far. There is a plethora of players who have scored six goals within the top five leagues so far while Nigeria international striker Paul Onuachu has fired home eight goals already for Genk in the Belgian Jupiler League.
