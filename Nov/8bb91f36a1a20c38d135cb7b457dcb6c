 TRADITIONAL rulers in Njaba Local Government Area of Imo State have accused the acting coucil chairman, Emeka Iheanacho, and other politicians, of sabotaging the recruitment of constables for community policing. Chairman of Njaba Council of Traditional Rulers and monarch of Amazano community Caesar Duruegbusuo made the allegation at a stakeholders’ meeting at Nkume Community Hall. Duruegbusuo said politicians hijacked the recruitment and sidelined the royal fathers who are the chief security officers of their communities. According to him, this negated the instructions of Governor Hope Uzodimma, and said it could sabotage government’s security efforts. He said: “Governor Uzodimma said traditional rulers should select people to fill up the community policing list. Unfortunately, politicians in the council decided to select their boys. We’re talking about security, and there is no way you will bring someone to secure any community without the leadership knowing who it is. “We therefore reject the list sent for community policing from Njaba. The people we selected  were rejected by politicians who substituted them with their loyalists. No monarch should be held accountable for any security breach in any community in Njaba. Our governor should note this.” But Chairman of the Interim Management Chairman (IMC) Emeka Iheanacho debunked the allegation, saying, “We chose only qualified candidates from the communities in Njaba”. Iheanacho also denied that the royal fathers were sidelined in the selection process as they made contributions. He promised that the monarchs would be given the opportunity to make substantial contributions in future recruitments.
