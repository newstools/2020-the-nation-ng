Fire on Sunday gutted the Bodija outlet of Grandex Supermarket, a chain store owned and operated by Mrs. Florence Ajimobi, the wife of ex-Oyo State governor Abiola Ajimobi. The fire, which reportedly started around 3pm from the back office of the outlet, was spreading to the main stores but for the effort of fire fighters. Men of the Oyo State Fire Service who arrive the scene promptly, battled the fire to prevent it from razing the entire outlet or spreading to nearby facilities. They were assisted by officials of the Federal Fire Service to put out the fire. Men of the state Joint Security Task Force Team called ‘Operation Burst’ prevented looting. After being alerted, Mrs. Ajimobi arrived the scene in company with friends and family to monitor the situation. The team leader of the Federal Fire Service, who spoke with reporters on condition of anonymity, attributed the fire to electrical sparks and over-loading of electrical sockets. No official statement was released by the management last night.
