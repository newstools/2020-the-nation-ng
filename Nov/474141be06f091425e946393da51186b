Daring armed robbers in the notorious Sakponba area of Benin, the Edo State capital, on Wednesday snatched a car belonging to a nursing mother. The criminals pushed her baby and grandmother out of the vehicle. The robbery took place on Murtala Mohammed Way, not far from where two armed robbers were lynched on Tuesday. Witnesses said the criminals swooped on the car, pushing out the occupants at gunpoint. At the time of the robbery, the baby was wrapped in a white shawl and placed at the back of the car. Police spokesman, Chidi Nwabuzor, a Superintendent of Police (SP), could not be reached at press time for reaction, as he was with the state’s Commissioner of Police, Babatunde Kokumo, receiving the visiting Inspector-General of Police Mohammed Adamu.
