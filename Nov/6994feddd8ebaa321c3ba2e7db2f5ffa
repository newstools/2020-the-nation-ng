Lennox Lewis believes Tyson Fury is capable of causing Anthony Joshua an array of problems when the British heavyweights finally meet in the ring next year. Fury and Joshua are widely expected to lock horns in 2021 in a hotly anticipated British heavyweight showdown and Lewis, a WBC, IBF, IBO champion from his own heavyweight career, believes the Gypsy King is most likely to emerge victorious. Lewis, 55, was full of praise for how Fury defeated Deontay Wilder in their rematch back in February and believes that confidence, blended with his height and punching ability, means Joshua faces a formidable task to beat him. “The Fury and Joshua fight, you have got two big guys and they can punch and they can box,’ Lewis said in an exclusive interview with the Gary Newbon Sports Show with Utilita on Punching.TV.  “You’ve got Fury, he is a switch hitter and he is going into the fight with a lot more dangerous things to watch out for – the fact that he can punch with left hand, with his right. “He is a slugger as well, the way he went after Deontay (Wilder), nobody expected that. He said what he is going to do and he did it. I like guys who box with confidence like that.” Lewis also believes that Fury’s height compared to Joshua, who at 6ft 6in has a three-inch disadvantage, will make his life a lot easier. “I have always said that it is always difficult boxing taller guys,’ Lewis explained. “He is 6ft 9, you are not going to get any sparring partners who are 6ft 9 to go in there. AJ has to figure that out as well. It is going to take him a few rounds.” Before facing Fury, Joshua will defend his IBF, WBA and WBO heavyweight titles against Kubrat Pulev on December 12 at The O2 in London.
