 SENIOR members of the English and Scottish governments in Britain have outlined the lockdown restrictions for residents in their countries over the next few weeks. British Health Secretary Matt Hancock revealed in a speech to parliament yesterday which areas in England will have the toughest local lockdown rules when the country comes out of nationwide quarantine on Dec. 2. England will revert to a tiered system. Under tier 1, the most relaxed restrictions, up to six people are allowed to meet inside and outside and most businesses – including pubs and restaurants – can remain open as long as they offer table service. Hancock said cities in northern England and the Midlands, including Manchester, Birmingham, and Leicester, would face the toughest restrictions, known as tier 3, while London would be in tier 2. Residents in tier 2 are allowed to socialise with people in groups of up to six people outside, but not inside, and pubs and restaurants can stay open, with table service, but can only sell alcohol alongside “substantial” meals. Residents in tier 3 are not allowed to socialise with others indoors or most places outdoors, unless they live with them, and pubs and restaurants will only allow takeaway services. Hancock said hospital admissions had fallen 7 per cent and cases were down 19 per cent compared to last week. The new measures will be reviewed in two weeks’ time. Before his speech, a website was published by the British government allowing people to see which tier they are in. It crashed moments after launch, prompting criticism for Hancock from fellow lawmakers.
