Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde said on Wednesday that the Oyo State Security Network Agency, code-named Amotekun Corps, is the state’s local response to crime. He said Southwest states are ready to combat crimes through the security agency, which was launched in January as a Southwest regional security outfit to combat crime in collaboration with the police and other federal security agencies. A statement by Mr. Taiwo Adisa, the Chief Press Secretary to Governor Makinde, quoted the governor as saying this. Speaking at the Passing-Out Parade of the 1,500 pioneer Amotekun Corps, held at the Emmanuel Alayande College of Education, Oyo, Governor Makinde said the six states of the region, namely Ekiti, Lagos, Ogun, Ondo, Osun and Oyo states would fight a common enemy, elements who appear determined to cause commotion and perpetrate crime. The governor said the approval and establishment of a Police Mobile Force 72 Squadron at Ago-Are, Oke Ogun area of the state by the Inspector-General of Police, as well as provision of vehicles and logistic support for the squadron was another step taken by his administration to boost security, adding that the government had equally requested another Police Mobile Force base in Oyo town. Makinde, who noted that state policing is the way forward to tackle insecurity, said the Amotekun initiative by the Southwest remained the next best thing in the absence of state police, as, according to him, it would help to fight crimes in the nooks and crannies of the society. “We have appointed two qualified men as chairman and commandant of the Amotekun Corps, the persons of retired General Ajibola Kunle Togun and retired Colonel Olayinka Olayanju. We also have other eminent persons on the board. I am confident that under them, the Amotekun Corps will live up to their objectives,” the governor said. Col. Olayanju (rtd) promised to work to secure the lives and properties of the people.
