The Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development is partnering United States-based AJ Tennis Academy to establish a world class academy in Abuja. Speaking during a visit to the Minister of Youth and Sports Development Sunday Dare in Abuja, Director of A J Tennis Academy International based in Minneapolis,  Tolu  Olaleye said he was excited by the prospect of partnering with  the Ministry  to develop the next generation  of tennis  players  as well as good citizens. “Our plan is to develop the tennis academy as a business in partnership with domestic and foreign investor to ensure long- term survival and serve as a model for other sports. We are here to explore ways of gaining support for this initiative from the Ministry of Youth and Sports Development. ”  In his response, the Minister said: “Thanks for your faith in Nigeria. The timing of this initiative is very good and in consonance with our new sports industry policy which classifies sports as business.  It also falls within the purview of our Adopt-A-Sport Initiative.  I fully support this initiative and will give whatever support needed to make it succeed.” The Minister further advised the initiator to consider replicating the academy in Ibadan, Lagos and Abeokuta to derive maximum benefits. The pilot project is to be sited in Abuja for which an expanse of land has been allocated by the Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA).
