Chrisland University, Abeokuta, Ogun State, has churned out 28 graduates at its 2020 Convocation programme with five students – all girls, making it to the First Class honours list. The Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Chinedum Babalola who made this known to The Nation, said that it appears “girls” are today more academically ‘focused” than their males’ counterparts. Mrs. Babalola explained that it should not be seen as strange or new that Chrisland produced only girls First Class graduands this time in an institution where there were also male students, recalling that similar phenomenon had also been observed at the nation’s premier university – the University of Ibadan, wherein a particular year, only girls made it to the First Class honours list. Addressing reporters ahead of the Convocation ceremony slated for tomorrow (Thursday) at the institution’s campus, Ajebo, Abeokuta, the Professor of Pharmacy said the best student scored over 5 Grade Point Aggregate(GPA). She noted that the school is out to bring out the best products that could compete effectively with their peers anywhere in the world, saying the institution made progress during the year 2019 with 12 new additional programmes introduced between January and March, last year. According to her, the 12 programmes have also been fully approved by the National University Commission (NUC). Babalola further explained that the university despite the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, the university experienced unbroken academic calendar, having to be about the first university in Nigeria to kick – start virtual class and virtual matriculations for its students.
