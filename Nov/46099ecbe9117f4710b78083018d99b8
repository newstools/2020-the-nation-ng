 Super Eagles striker, Victor Osimhen , has admitted that the record set by ex-Eagles Rashidi Yekini would be too challenging  to break but  the Napoli hit man  is bracing up to the arduous task. Osimhen has hit the ground running with the Eagles since his  debut three years  which has seen him scored  four goals in eight official matches. Speaking ahead of today’s 2021 AFCON qualifier against the Leone Stars of Sierra Leone , Osimhen acknowledged that Yekini’s shoes would be too difficult for him to wear considering his  storied  accomplishments for the Super Eagles. Osimhen reckoned that if he is able to stay injury-free as well as getting regular shirts in the national team, he could aim at Yekini’s goals record with Eagles.  “Rashidi Yekini’s shoe is too heavy for me to wear,” the  FIFA U-17 World Cup record goal scorer said.“ He was an accomplished striker and internationally recognised too. I am only trying to do my best.” He continued: “If I am injury-free, I believe I can achieve it though it won’t be easy. With the confidence reposed in me by my coaches and my teammates, I believe it is a target I can work towards.” It would be recalled that the late Yekini who died on 4th May 2012 at 48, remains Nigeria’s topmost goal scorer with a record 37 goals in 58 games.
