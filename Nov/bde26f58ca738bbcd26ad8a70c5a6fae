Ondo Deputy Governor, Agboola Ajayi, has alleged Monday’s sack of the Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Kolawole Olawoye, was part of the plot by Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu to ensure his impeachment. Ajayi said the impeachment of Ondo Deputy Speaker, Hon Ogundeji Iroju, was also part of the plans to remove him from office ‘by all means and at any cost illegally.’ The Deputy Governor, in a statement by his Media Adviser, Allen Sowore, said Olawoye was sacked for standing against illegality and iniquity. According to him: “Today, Mr. Governor has clandestinely orchestrated the announcement of the removal of the Deputy Speaker of the House Of Assembly, Rt Honourable Ogundeji Iroju without any due process. “All these are premeditated efforts to circumvent the institutions of state and usurp the powers of both the legislative and judiciary arms of government to pave way for the illegal removal of the Deputy Governor. “The general public should be wary of these latest antics and desperation of the Governor to remove his Deputy through a macabre plan to forged signatures of members of the State House Of Assembly on the prepared impeachment notice.”
