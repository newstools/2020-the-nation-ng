 Enyimba FC of Aba remained the only Nigeria’s successful team in this weekend continental club competition with  a 1-0 away win yesterday over Rahimo FC in the first leg preliminary round of the CAF Champions League tie  at the Stade du 4 Aout in Ouagadougou. Victor Mbaoma’s 76th  minute goal handed People’s Elephants a vital victory in Burkina Faso. The second leg fixture is scheduled for next weekend at the Aba International Stadium. Enyimba met Rahimo at this stage last season and they overcame a first-leg deficit to advance on a 5-1 aggregate.  But Plateau United were unlucky yesterday as they suffered a shock 1-0 home defeat to Simba SC of Tanzania in the first leg preliminary round CAF Champions League tie at the Jos international Stadium. Zambian International, Clatous Chama’s 54th  minute goal was all the visitors needed to secure all three important points at stake in the game. The result means Coach Abdu Maikaba-tutored side is walking a tightrope in qualifying for the next stage of the competition as they need to overturn the 1-0 deficit away to secure a passage to the next round. The second leg is scheduled for next month.
