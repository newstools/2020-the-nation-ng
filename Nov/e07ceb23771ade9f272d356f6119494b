Taiwo Awoniyi is delighted to net his first Bundesliga goal for Union Berlin after five matches over the weekend. Awoniyi netted the opening goal as Union Berlin secured a 2-1 away win at FC Koln in the Bundesliga on Sunday. The Liverpool loanee’s first goal for the club kick-started a third successive victory that now moved them to fifth in the German top flight. In a video shared by the club, Awoniyi expressed his delight at grabbing what was his first goal for the club and also help the team extend their unbeaten run in the league. He also urged the fans, ‘who are watching from home’ to get behind the team. “It was a great game for the team and a great victory as well. Keep on supporting, we love you,” he said. Awoniyi joined the club last summer having also spent last season on loan at Mainz 05.
