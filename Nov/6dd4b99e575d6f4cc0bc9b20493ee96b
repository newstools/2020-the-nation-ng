Former Nigerian ambassador to Spain and wife of the former Biafran leader,   Dim Chukwuemeka Ojukwu, Mrs. Bianca Ojukwu has lashed  out at Igbo leaders for keeping silent on the alleged continuous marginalisation of the people of South East by the federal government. This is just as Bianca also tongue-lashed  the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) and its leadership over lack of interest in posthumous honour to her husband. Bianca spoke during the ninth edition of Dim Chukwuemeka Ojukwu memorial ceremony held at Ojukwu Centre Owerri, the Imo State capital. Ojukwu died in 2011 in London, but nine years down the line, the members of Movement for the Sovereign State of Biafra and Biafra Independence Movement founded by Chief Ralph Uwazuruike have consistently organised memorial ceremony for the late Biafra leader. Ojukwu’s widow, accused Igbo leaders of not talking for their people but being, “in a rat race to be included in the center”, thus leaving the issues affecting the generality of their people. She stressed the need for the  government to treat Ndigbo fairly in the distribution of the nation’s resources, stating that Ndigbo had been roundly marginalized in the country.
