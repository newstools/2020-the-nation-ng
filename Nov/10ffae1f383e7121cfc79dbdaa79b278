MOMAS Electricity Meters Manufacturing Company (MEMMCOL) is set to train over 300 unemployed youths on meter installation to complement the Presidential Mass Metering Initiative. MEMMCOL Chairman, Kola Balogun, an engineer, told reporters that the initiative was aimed at developing the country’s manpower capability as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). He said the free metering installation training is for unemployed youths selected from the six geo-political zones. According to him, over 15 governors have indicated an interest in sending youths to MOMAS factory for the training. He said that the training will begin at the MOMAS Metering School at the Momas Factory, Orimerunmu, Mowe, Ogun State, today. The first phase of the programme will last for two weeks. Graduates will get certificates. Balogun said: “MOMAS, a key stakeholder in the downstream of the power sector, sees the initiative as a viable way to create employment opportunities for our youths and the timing is unprecedented given the fact that one of the complaints by the aggrieved youths doing the recent #EndSARS# protest is unemployment. “MOMAS also identified that there is an urgent need to train more Nigerians on electricity meter installation to compliments the Presidential directive. “This is our way of contributing our quota at ensuring that the initiative is successful. We have decided to train a selected number of graduates across all the six geo-political zones in the country on metering technology through our MOMAS metering school for free.”
