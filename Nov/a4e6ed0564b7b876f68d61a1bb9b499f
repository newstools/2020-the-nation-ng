Owners/occupiers of illegal structures/shanties, including containarised shops around Fagba, at Abattoir, new Oko-Oba, Lagos, have been given a seven-day removal order to evacuate their belongings. The order was given at the weekend by the Lagos States Environmental and Special Offences (Enforcement) Unit (Task Force). Agency Chairman Olayinka Egbeyemi, a Chief Superintendent of Police, who led the enforcement team, said occupiers of over 2,500 illegal structures/shanties, including containerised shops, were served removal order in the area. He said the shanties were occupied by hoodlums, who burnt and destroyed public and private properties in the area during the ENDSARS protest. “It was an eyesore that miscreants, including minors, smoked Indian hemp in the area. “You will recall that as part of the on-the-spot assessment of extent of destruction of public and private properties by hoodlums during the last protest, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and Police Commissioner Hakeem Odumosu visited Fagba along Abattoir new Oko-Oba area,” Egbeyemi said.
