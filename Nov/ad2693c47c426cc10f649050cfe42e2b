The Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Lagos State,  Mr. Moyosore Onigbanjo, (SAN), and the Director, Lagos State Citizens’ Mediation Centre (CMC), Mrs. Abiola Oseni, have urged all residents of Lagos to embrace Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) as a means of resolving disputes. Mrs. Oseni, who stated this while speaking on the CMC activity report for the month of October 2020, noted that the centre amicably resolved 516 cases spanning a wide range of issues such as landlord/tenancy, land disputes and monetary claims, among others. She stated  that the total number of cases received during the period was 820, out of which 516 cases were successfully settled; 86 cases were referred to appropriate agencies of government;104 cases were terminated due to non-attendance at mediation sessions by the parties involved, while 114 cases are currently adjourned for further mediation. Mrs. Oseni said the centre recovered N23.7 million for parties in the month under review, being the total value of settlement of debt related matters. Reiterating CMC’s commitment  to upholding law and order, she said Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) was less cumbersome and inexpensive in settling all kinds of disagreement among Lagosians. “Not everybody can afford to pay for legal representation in courts, which is not necessary with the CMC. People should begin to realise that ADR is the only way of getting justice without having to pay for it,” she added.
