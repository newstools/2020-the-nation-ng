 ENUGU State Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi has appealed to men and officers of the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) to renew their commitment towards securing lives and property by returning to their duty posts. Ugwuanyi made the appeal when he visited the Senior Police Officers Mess on Agbani Road, Enugu, to address and commiserate with them over the death of private citizens and security personnel. The governor, who described the mayhem as ‘an unusual and challenging period for the police force’, noted that it was needless and ‘an ill-wind that blew no one any good’. He said: “The government has set up a panel of inquiry to determine the deaths and other damages. We earnestly await the panel’s recommendations as we are committed to implementing same to soothe the pains of victims. “I implore you to renew your commitment to securing lives and property, as was the case before the protests.” Police Commissioner Ahmad Abdurrahman, thanked Ugwuanyi for his humility, responsibility, concern, care and love. He also hailed the governor for finding it necessary and expedient to visit men and officers of the command over the unfortunate fallout of the #EndSARS protests. The police boss said the visit signified that ‘we are under a very comfortable hand and care’. He, therefore, urged officers to pray for the governor and extend ‘our love, dedication and patriotism to him to enable him comfortably discharge his responsibilities’.
