Lewis Hamilton secured a record-equalling seventh Formula One world title yesterday after winning the Turkish Grand Prix despite starting sixth on the grind to match Michael Schumacher’s haul of drivers’ crowns with three races of the season remaining. The 35-year-old sealed his latest title with a typically measured master class, handling treacherous wet early conditions to claim his 94th career win despite his unaccustomed start position. A breathless Hamilton said: “I’m lost for words. This is way beyond my dreams.”  Hamilton, who sealed his first title in 2008, was adding to his unprecedented roster of records – most wins with 94, most pole positions (97), most podium finishes (163) and most consecutive points finishes (47).This latest triumph gave Hamilton an unassailable lead over Bottas, with two races in Bahrain and the season-closing Abu Dhabi Grand Prix to come.
