President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday, met with leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) from the Southwest, led by Chief Bisi Akande. The meeting, which took place in the Presidentâ€™s office in the Aso Rock Presidential Villa, Abuja, held behind closed-doors. Those in the visiting party included Chief Bisi Akande, Chief Segun Osoba, Prince Tajudeen Olusi and Dr. Abayomi Finnih. All attempts to get a clue of what the meeting was all about or topic for discussion were unsuccessful as the visitors would not talk to State House Correspondents.
