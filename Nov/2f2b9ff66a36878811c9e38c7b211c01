 NO fewer than 15 people have died following the outbreak of haemorrhagic fever at Ute Okpu and Idumesa communities in Ika North East Local Government Area of Delta State, the Delta State Government has said. It said outcome of the samples collected by the Ministry of Health officers would give an indication of the disease and determine the next line of action. Health Commissioner Dr. Mordi Ononye, who spoke on Sunday at Ute Okpu in Ika North-East Local Government, said the state government had constituted a team to unravel the mysterious disease that had claimed 15 persons from 18 to 25 years in the past two weeks. He said: “Delta State Government has received information about seemingly mysterious deaths at Ute Okpu and Idumesa communities of Ika North East Local Government, which prompted Governor Ifeanyi Okowa to direct the Ministry of Health to investigate these deaths, identify the  cause/causes and effect containment measures.” Ononye said a directive has been given by Governor Okowa to upgrade the Comprehensive Health Centre in Ute-Okpu to a full-fledged hospital, and called on members of the community and residents of the state to observe good hygiene, as the dry season approaches, by covering their food, cutting grasses around their surroundings, eliminating rats in their houses and observing the COVID-19 safety guidelines by washing their hands with soap and running water. But Dr. Richard Ikwuogu, the state epidemiologist, said his office sent officers to the community immediately the information reached the Ministry of Health, adding that the active case search that began the previous day continues. He said his team had visited the families of the affected persons in the community, collected their samples and interviewed them. Ikwogu said although a suspicion of viral haemorrhagic fever, or substance abuse, the outcome of the test on collected samples would give clear information on the disease and that would determine the next line of action.
