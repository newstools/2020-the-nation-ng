Rivers State Governor Nyeson Wike, and his Commissioner for Sports, Boma Iyaye, have hailed the organisers of the recently concluded Governor Wike Pre-Season Championship. Speaking during the final, the governor, who was represented by the Chairman of Rivers State PDP, Desmond Akawor, said the standard of play at the tournament was great while expressing happiness that the state’s team, Rivers United, won the title. “For a team to get to the final and actually played till level of penalties to determine the winner, that’s to show that the standard here is very high. It is not just about the win, but to measure the standard of play which we have achieved. One thing that is convincing is that the investment in sports especially football in the state is actually a worthwhile investments,” he said.  In the same vein, Iyaye lauded the standard of the championship while revealing that Rivers United is still far away from a finish team. He added that this year’s edition was better than last year as there were several innovations in the 2020 edition. Rivers United defeated Nigeria National League side, Bayelsa United, 5-4 on penalties after the regulation time ended 1-1.
