Tributes have been pouring in for a young medical doctor, Valentine Egbabon, 32, who reportedly died of Coronavirus at the Yaba COVID-19 Intensive Care Unit in Lagos. A series of tweets by his colleagues showed that Egbabon died on Monday after testing positive for the virus three weeks ago. The aspiring surgeon was on the frontline, treating injured protesters as the #EndSARS agitations against police brutality intensified nationwide. “Today is a sad day! My colleague and classmate @ehival lost his life after testing positive for COVID-19 three weeks ago. He was an active young man with a beautiful family and a bright future ahead of him. May his soul rest in perfect peace ???? No one is safe,” Cassandra Akinde, Medical Doctor and Chevening Scholar, tweeted on Monday. Another doctor and social media influencer, Nonso Egembe (aka Aproko doctor), also wrote rousing tributes for the late Egbabon “Rest in peace, Dr. Val. COVID-19 took you from us, but it can’t erase your memories. You were fit as a fiddle. You lived on in our hearts. Rest on brother. Rest on.”  Another doctor, Dr. Olufunmilayo Harvey (@Yourfaveonlinedoc) in the United Kingdom (UK), also wrote in his Twitter timeline: ” A young medical doctor @ehival has died from COVID-19. This is very sad and heartbreaking. I just checked his page again now. He even used RIP Jimoh and #EndSARS as profile name. He believed in Nigeria. He wanted a better country. Today, he is gone. May God comfort his family.”
