 THE leaders of the umbrella body of Ijaw youths, Ijaw Youth Council Worldwide (IYC), have converged on Yenagoa, Bayelsa State capital, over the vexatious issues of true federalism, the militarisation of Niger Delta communities, gas flaring, water resource bill and restructuring. They, therefore, declared their readiness to confront the Federal Government with their demands for equity, justice and resource control. The IYC zonal leaders, elders, past presidents and deputy presidents of the council including Dr. Chris Ekiyor, the Special Adviser to Bayelsa State Governor on Ijaw National Affairs, Onifie Jon Jon, among others, were present at the well-attended meeting chaired by the President of the IYC, Comrade Peter Igbifa. They resolved that a final position on the issues raised at the consultative meeting would be unveiled at the end of the ongoing consultations with various ethnic groups and state governors across the Niger Delta region. Also speaking, the spokesman for the IYC, Comrade Ebilade Ekerefe, noted that the position of Ijaw youths on various contentious issues of resource control, restructuring and many others would be a watershed for the country in the next few weeks.
