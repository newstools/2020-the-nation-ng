LIVERPOOL boss Jurgen Klopp had a face like thunder as the final whistle sounded at Brighton’s Amex Stadium on Saturday lunchtime and no wonder. His side looked to have ground out the ugliest, yet most valuable, of victories on the south coast. They had overcome the schedule and the travel, ridden their luck and absorbed yet another injury. They had scrapped and worked and fought and they were ready to head north with the points. They led through Diogo Jota’s goal, had seen Brighton miss a first-half penalty and watched as Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane had efforts chalked off, narrowly but correctly, for offside after consultation with VAR. And then, in stoppage time, came the final twist, the hammer blow. Again, it was VAR at the centre of things. Stuart Attwell, the referee, saw nothing wrong when Danny Welbeck tumbled under a challenge from Andy Robertson, but Kevin Friend, from the Stockley Park studio, advised him to have a rethink. Robertson, replays showed, had caught Welbeck’s foot as he tried to clear the ball. Trouble. Attwell headed to the video monitor – an ominous sign indeed in this modern world – and, after a second look, and then a third, pointed to the spot. Pascal Gross did what Neal Maupay could not do earlier in the game and found the net from 12 yards. Brighton had a share of the spoils and Klopp’s mood took another turn for the worse. It was certainly dark when he exchanged words with Attwell at the final whistle, and it was even darker a few minutes later when he was interviewed about the game by BT Sport’s Des Kelly. What followed was remarkable. Great television, if truth be told. Klopp opted not to criticise the officials – “I think that the decisions were right,” he said, straight-faced – instead training his sights on another target.
