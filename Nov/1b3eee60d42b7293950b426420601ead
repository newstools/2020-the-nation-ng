 A POLICEMAN attached to the Marine Department and identified simply as Inspector James has gunned down a civilian security guard hired by a company at Abonnema Wharf in Port Harcourt, Rivers State. Mr. Innocent Gbaraka, father of the deceased, wept uncontrollably, threatening to commit suicide if the police failed to give him justice. “I am finished,” he sobbed. “If not that my wife stopped me, I would have hanged myself”. Gbaraka’s son, Gospel, was killed at his place of work on Sunday, The Nation learnt. Gbaraka called on the Inspector-General of Police, the state police commissioner to intervene in the matter. “I asked the supervisor of the company what happened, and he said a policeman working in the same company with my son shot him dead. I don’t have anything to say than let justice prevail,” he said. The Centre for Basic Rights Protection and Accountability Campaign (CBRPAC) called for an investigation. Secretary Board of Trustee, CBRPAC, Prince Wiro, urged the police to hasten their investigation and begin prosecution of anybody found wanting. The policeman who reportedly pulled the trigger has been detained, it was gathered. Youths under the auspices of Ogoni Youths Federation (OYF) also demanded justice.
