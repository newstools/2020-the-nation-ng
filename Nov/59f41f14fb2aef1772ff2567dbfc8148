President Muhammadu Buhari has mourned the death of former Kaduna State governor, Alhaji Balarabe Musa, who died on Wednesday morning. The President, who described the late Musa as a reflection of the passion and vigour that heralded Nigeria’s independence from colonialism, affirmed that the vocal politician and advocate of good governance had left a bold footprint on the nation’s democracy. According to a statement issued by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, President Buhari noted that the ardent critic of his administration and those before his would be sorely missed. “President Muhammadu Buhari joins government and people of Kaduna State in mourning a former civilian governor of the state, Alhaji Balarabe Musa, whose passing will be sorely missed by all Nigerians, who have diligently followed his antecedents as a voice for the voiceless. “President Buhari believes Alhaji Musa reflected the passion and vigour that heralded Nigeria’s independence, which steadily translated into activism for return to democracy at the height of military interregnum and has remained steadfast in the call for good and inclusive governance. “As the former governor goes home, the President affirms that he left a bold footprint on Nigeria’s democracy, and his role in promoting good governance and development will always be remembered and appreciated by posterity. “President Buhari prays that the almighty God will grant his soul eternal rest, and comfort his family, friends, and associates,” the statement said.
