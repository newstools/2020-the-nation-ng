The Chairman, Board of Trustees (BoT) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Walid Jibrin, has said the 2021 governorship election in Anambra State will determine the place of Igbo in Nigerian politics. According to him, the PDP has all it takes to win the 2021 election. He also urged party leaders to begin grassroots mobilisation to make it a reality. Jibrin spoke at the weekend during a reception for the state Chairman, Ndubuisi Nwobu, by the party’s chapter in Anambra Central. According to him, the reception was another strategy to unite the party ahead of the election. He said: “All hands must be on deck as next year’s election will determine the future of the state and the fate of Ndigbo in the Nigerian political structure.” Nwobu expressed satisfaction about the party’s unity, saying the PDP would produce a governor who would understand governance, care for Ndi Anambra and the state’s growth. He assured the national leadership that the party, under his watch, would do everything legitimately possible to win the 2021 governorship. The reception was attended by National Vice Chairman Austin Umahi and former National Women Leader Chief Josephine Anenih. However, former Governor Peter Obi, Senators Uche Ekwunife and Stella Oduah, were absent and no reason was given for their absence.
