Some students of the Tai Solarin University of Education (TASUED), Ijebu-Ode , Ogun State yesterday stormed the Lagos State Court of Arbitration, Lekki, venue of the   Judicial Panel of Inquiry on SARS Abuses, demanding   justice for one of them, Pelumi Onifade. Onifade died in the custody of the Lagos State Task force. The students, led by TASUED Student Union Government (SUG) President, Abdulazeez Soneye, said the deceased  was arrested by officers of the Lagos State Task force on October 24 only to be found dead a few days later. Soneye said: “He worked with Gboah TV, an online media platform. He went out to cover an incident at the Ministry of Agriculture, Abattoir, Agege, Lagos. “He was found dead under mysterious circumstances a few days after his arrest. “Due to the ASUU strike , he worked at the online media house. He was arrested in spite of his ID and a reflector jacket showing he was a pressman.” The task force officials, he alleged, refused to listen to pleas by his colleagues that he was with them. “We are demanding that the head of the Lagos State Task force, CSP Saheed Egbeyemi and the Commissioner of Police, CP be called to explain what happened to our colleague. Reacting to the allegations, Egbeyemi, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN by phone  that the  late Onifade’s case had been handed over to the police for investigation. “The case is with the Commissioner of Police, speak with the Police Public Relations Officer (PRO), I don’t know much about it,” he said.
