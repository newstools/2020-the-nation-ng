The Lagos State Judicial Panel of Enquiry and Restitution for Victims of SARS related abuses and other matters has begun viewing of 2 hours 29 minutes of the October 20 Lekki shootings footage captured by the Lekki Concession Company (LCC). This portion of the total 21-hour footage begins from 5pm and ends at 7:59pm. Soldiers have been accused of shooting at #EndSARS protesters, injuring and killing some, an allegation the military has denied. The shootings were believed to have occurred from just over 6pm on October 20.
About four hours of the video were played on October 6 between 11:35am and nearly past 5pm, with a pause in between during break time. But lawyers to the parties agreed to limit the 21-hour footage to portions relevant to the shootings. The video is broken into footages of roughly 30 minutes in length. The video was tendered by LCC Managing Director, Abayomi Omomuwa, through LCC’s counsel, Rotimi Seriki. The Federal Government has also denied anyone was killed at the toll gate, following a CNN report claiming otherwise. Details shortly…
