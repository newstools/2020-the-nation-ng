Gunmen at the weekend killed an engineer from Agana, Andoni Local Government Area of Rivers State, Michael Ebirien-Agana. It was gathered that the assailants ambushed Ebirien-Agana at a bad spot on the Igbo-Etche road while returning home about 9pm. The hoodlums reportedly dragged him out of his car, shot him and zoomed off. A Good Samaritan was said to have rushed him to a hospital where he was confirmed dead. A source said: “There is a bad spot on the Igbo-Etche Road. That was where they killed him. They shot him without taking anything from his car. They just went for his life. Maybe they are assassins. “He was an engineer and a promising young man. Michael was a gentleman, very humble. He was one of those we looked up to for leadership in Andoni council. It is unfortunate that his life has been cut shot.” The source added that the deceased was an employee of Andoni council before he was transferred to Emuoha council, adding that his remains had been deposited at the Military Hospital mortuary in Port Harcourt. Police spokesman Nnamdi Omoni, who confirmed the incident, said: “The deceased was rushed to the military hospital where he finally died. Investigation is on to ascertain what happened.”
