 AN Ibadan-based Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), the Life Support Network (LSN), has said about 17.5 million children in Nigeria do not have access to education and health facilities. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the NGO, Miss Itunuoluwa Ajayi, reeled out the statistics from a report of an international organisation while delivering a speech at the 2020 admission of new international volunteers into the organisation in Ibadan. Speaking about the topic:  ”Nigeria, towards Rebirth of our Collective Destiny,” she said 13 per cent of Nigerians have been rendered homeless in recent times due to poverty. Ajayi lamented the prevalent poverty, particularly in the North, saying it had led to anger and disgust among people. She said most Nigerians are poor because they are not earning good income, urging the government to create job opportunities to tackle unemployment. Speaking about the role of her NGO in alleviating the suffering of the masses, Ajayi said LSN is giving life to the less-privileged, orphanages and vagabonds. On the challenges facing the NGO, she said: “The major challenge we have is finance. We want the government to support us because there is limit to what volunteers can contribute to our work.” Ajayi urged the newly-inaugurated volunteers to ensure they are committed to the job, stressing that soul-saving is their business.
