He said he would continue to join other good intentioned Nigerians to take #EndSARS agitations serious, noting the case of police brutality was one issue that affects every facet of the society. “I am a victim of police brutality myself. You could all recall what happened to me during my election of 2014. But some policemen had also rendered good services to me, so not all of them are bad,” he started. Describing the teeming youths as engine room of the nation’s economy, Fayemi stated that there was need for the governments to partner with them for sustainable peace and development. “The EndSARS protest was a noble course. It was supported here in Ekiti not because of those involved, but for the reason behind the action which we believe would help the police to do their “The youth protest in Ekiti was well intentioned and peaceful. Right to peaceful protest is an inalienable right. For the first time we have panel of inquiries at every level of government to tackle our issues. “We must not resort to violence as a solution to our agitations. We must all speak in unison against violence as we did in unison against Police brutality. “Our youth are angry because as they were coming out of closure of schools over coronavirus pandemic, they entered into ASUU strike, then there is hunger in the land and the harsh economic situation in our country. “The government has done many intervention programmes and had proscribed SARS and introduced youth investment fund and many others as a response to the youth agitations. “Our police must be motivated to do well. Policemen must be well remunerated. There must be good motivation for the police to be able to discharge their duties effectively”.
