The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Wednesday re-arraigned Abiodun Sodiq before an Ikeja Special Offences Court for alleged 40,000 euro fraud. Sodiq was arraigned on a seven-count charge of fraud, forgery and conspiracy. The EFCC alleged that the defendant defrauded a businessman, Babatunde Emmanuel, on the pretext of using the money for Malta Government citizenship Investment Programme and procurement of Malta international passport. When the charges were read to him, he pleaded not guilty. EFCC prosecuting lawyer Nkereuwem Nana asked the court for a trial date. But the defense lawyer, Elizabeth Ezerhume, informed the court of a pending application due for hearing. Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo adjourned till December 7 for ruling and trial.
