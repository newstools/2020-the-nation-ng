The Chairman of Katsina State Amalgamation Youth Entrepreneurs Development Cooperative Union (KAYEDCU) on Inter-local Government Skill Acquisitions Programme, Alhaji Sani Sanda, said the government through its support and donation to the 150-member association had ensured that every member of the group benefitted from the programme. He said: “Over 10,000 women received loans and training through skill acquisition programmes, which helped them in purchasing materials to produce bags, clothes and other locally-made valuable items. ‘’I urge our members and beneficiaries to utilise the opportunities given to them by the government and establish themselves’’ Secretary to the State Government (SSG) Muhammed Mustapha Inuwa said the government was determined to fight poverty and other social and economic problems endangering people’s lives. The SSG, represented by his Permanent Secretary, Kasimu Ibrahim Nagari, praised the well- coordinated behaviour of the union through cooperation to access non- interest loans and grants, which he noted, had been paid. He reiterated the government’s commitment to continue with its programme of empowering the poor to ameliorate their hardship, saying it has been the tradition of the current administration under Governor Aminu Bello Masari to help the poor.
