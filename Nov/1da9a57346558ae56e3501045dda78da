Mrs. Sade Ale, wife of the Chief of Staff to Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State, reunited with her family on Saturday after spending 48 hours in the dungeon of gunmen who abducted her. She was rescued by a combined team of local hunters, members of the state security outfit, Amotekun, and security agents. Mrs. Ale was abducted at Owena on the Ondo- Akure on Thursday night while returning from Lagos. The Nation gathered that her release was secured early on Saturday after the hunters and other security agencies located the den of the kidnappers. Sources said some suspects were arrested in connection with the kidnapping. Said one source: “I can confirm to you that the wife of the Chief of Staff has secured her freedom and she is on her way to Akure. She was released without paying ransom as she was rescued by Amotekun and local hunters.” Commandant of the Amotekun Corps, Chief Adetunji Adeleye, who confirmed the release of Mrs. Ale said it was too early to disclose how the rescue operation was carried out. Mrs. Ale was kidnapped a few hours after gunmen shot dead  the Olufon of Ifon, in Ondo State, Oba Isreal Adeusi, at Elegbeka community on the Ifon-Benin Highway. The Olufon was returning to his domain from Akure, the state capital where he had attended a meeting of traditional rulers in the state.
