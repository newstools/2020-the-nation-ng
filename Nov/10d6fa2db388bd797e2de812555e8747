Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde has said the families of police officers who were killed during the #EndSARS protest will be compensated from the N500 million fund his administration set aside for victims of police brutality and injustice. The governor also promised to examine and grant the requests before him by the police command. Makinde made the promises while addressing men and officers of the police force during a visit to the state police command at Eleyele, Ibadan, the state capital. The governor urged the officers to forget the ugly events of previous weeks and work with the state government and other stakeholders to build the people’s trust while restoring orderliness and stability in the state. Sympathising with the police on the death of some of its officers, the burning of police stations and other killings, Makinde said his support for the EndSARS protest should not be misconstrued as a dislike for the police but for his desire for a better society. He said: “We have to win back the hearts of the people. The way to do it is to be professional in our conducts. I give you the assurance that together we shall win back the trust of the people. “I want to specially thank the Oyo State Command of the Nigeria Police because Oyo is a big state and vast with over 29,000 square kilometres and the size of some states. “From the bottom of my heart, I want to sympathise with the command. You lost five policemen. Also, about 12 policemen were injured, and you lost five police stations that were burnt down. I want to say you are not alone. The government and good people of Oyo State are with you. Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) in charge of the Southwest, Leye Oyebade, insisted that the role of the Police Force could not be outsourced. He urged officers to be proactive, take charge and ensure calmness across the state.
