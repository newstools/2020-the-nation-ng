 TO  eradicate the bureaucracy and difficulty faced by Federal public servants in obtaining a loan, Sycamore.ng has launched a loan initiative for all public sector employees in Nigeria. Following the Sycamore’s mission to financially empower people to achieve their dreams in Nigeria, this initiative stands to empower all Federal Government workers in Nigeria including the Nigeria Police Force and other qualified staff. According to the Chief Executive Officer, Sycamore, Mr. Babatunde Akin-Moses, “The difficulty faced by public servants in obtaining a loan is glaring. The Sycamore USSD loan initiative opens the possibility of obtaining a loan from any mobile device.” All public sector employees in Nigeria can obtain a loan from their mobile devices by simply dialing a USSD code. The Chief Marketing Officer, Miss Onyinyechukwuka Okonji said “By dialing the code *347*34#, all qualified applicants can access quality loans of N20, 000 and above with a repayment duration of one month and above. According to the Company’s Board Chairman, Mr Bade Aluko, the initiative is aimed at solving the problem that all public servants face in getting timely access to loans. The Sycamore public sector loan, he further said, is committed to empowering the public workers more than profit-making, as it has a very competitive interest rate. Aluko said Sycamore has ensured speed and accountability in the disbursal of the public sector loans. The company offers instant loan disbursements for amounts of N50,000 and below, with a turnaround duration of less than six for applications higher than N50,000. The Chief Executive Officer Sycamore, Mr. Babatunde Akin-Moses also said, “The process for this initiative is completely hassle-free. The application and repayment process is as fast as possible. As a Fintech platform in Nigeria, we are committed to empowering people in achieving their financial goals.”
