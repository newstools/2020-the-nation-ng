 THE Ota Area Police Command has inaugurated a family support unit to provide medical and psychological support for gender and domestic violence survivors in Ogun State. Area Commander, ACP Monday Agbonika said, “This is a one-stop for victims of sexual and gender-based violence. It is an upgrade of the traditional Nigeria police welfare centre which also contributes to the normal juvenile offences for missing and found children, sexual offences against minors and all gender based violence and domestic violence cases. “This is to ensure the  victim doesn’t go back to the house where he or  she was abused; so an avenue for financial independence is created. Agbonika said that collaboration with other agencies susch as the Ministry of Justice “will ensure that rape cases will get accelerated hearing. “When we get to court, the victims have a better chance of getting justice and ensuring the perpetrators are brought to book,” he said. He urged survivors of gender-based violence not to be discouraged by stigmatisation but rather get help and support. Wife of Ogun State governor, Mrs. Bamidele Abiodun in her remarks, said the greatest deterrent of crime is punishment and the full implementation of the Violence Against Persons (Protection) VAPP Act in the State will ensure this is replicated in all communities. “A robust approach to information, education and communication on domestic violence is needed across our state. People need to, not only know that the Family Support Unit exists, but they can come here to be safe,” she said.
