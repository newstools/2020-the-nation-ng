The new Captain of the Ilorin Golf Club, Dim Ray Okafor, has promised to transform the club to a world-class facility. Okafor is quietly following the footsteps of former Governor of Kwara State, the late Muhammed Lawal in restructuring the Ilorin Golf Club. The Owerri-born Okafor  who hitherto  was  usually playing squash  in the company  of  his bosom friend, the late General Tunde Idiagbon , switched to  golf in 2009 upon the demise  of the former Chief of Staff to the then Military Head of State Muhammadu Buhari.  Meanwhile, Okafor, who is into construction is planning to erect a 30-room guest house around the club house so golfers who visit can meet with available accommodation at relatively low cost. “I believe being a captain is a call to serve”, Okafor said. “Before coming to this post, I already knew what I wanted to do. “But when I came in, I saw there was no revenue to carry out my plans. I was not bothered and I opted to spend my own money just for the betterment of the Club,” he said.
