An unidentified woman has dumped her two weeks old baby boy at Commander Way Street in Oke-Ijebu, Akure, Ondo state capital. A security guard of a school who gave his name as Gbenga Adelusi said the baby was dumped at the school gate at about 5:30 am on Monday morning. He said he chanced upon the baby while doing his morning routine check-in every part of the school before handing over to the day guard when he heard the cry of the baby. Adelusi said he was shocked on sighting the baby, “On getting to the gate, the baby’s cry became stronger and I saw the baby wrapped in a black small Ghana-must-go bag.” An official of the Ondo Ministry of Women Affairs, Mrs. Yemisi Olagoke, said the matter has been reported to the police and the baby taken to the motherless babies’ home along Oba-Ile road. Olagoke urged young mothers who could not cater care for their babies to approach the Ministry’s Welfare Department of the Governor’s office rather than dumping them. She said the mother of the baby who dumped the baby was yet to be seen.
