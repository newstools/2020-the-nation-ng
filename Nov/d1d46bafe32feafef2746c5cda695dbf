The Police Command in Kano has confirmed the arrest of one Anas Sa’idu for allegedly kidnapping and murdering a 16-year-old, Tijjani Kabiru, at Kwanar Gwarmai Village in the Bebeji Local Government Area of the state. The spokesman of the command, DSP Abdullahi Haruna, stated this in a statement on Saturday in Kano. Haruna said the command on Nov. 9 received a complaint from the victim’s father, Alhaji Kabiru, that his son, Tijjani, was kidnapped at Kwanar Gwarmai, Kwanar Dangora town in Bebeji. He said the suspect demanded N1.3 million ransom and N20,000 MTN recharge card from the victim’s parents. The spokesman said the suspect was arrested by men of Operation Puff Adder on Nov. 23 at Kwanar Gwarmai Village in Bebeji. Haruna said preliminary investigations showed that the suspect, who resided within the same neighbourhood with the victim, invited him to farmland and then kidnapped him. The suspect, he said, strangled the victim to death when he realised that he had no place to hide. “The suspect called the victim’s father through his neighbour’s phone number and demanded a ransom of N1.3 and N20,000 MTN recharge card. “The suspect led a medical team and detectives to the spot where Tijjani was buried. “’ The body was exhumed, examined and released to his relatives for burial according to Islamic rites,” he said. Haruna said the Police Commissioner, Mr. Habu Sani, had ordered a discreet investigation into the incident. (NAN)
