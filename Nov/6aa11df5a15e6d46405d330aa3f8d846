 SOME angry youths have set a church on fire in Daudu town, Benue State over allegations that the pastor was complicit in alleged cases of missing human organs in the community. Daudu town is off Makurdi-Lafia federal highway. For the past one week there had been youth unrest over alleged missing male organs. On Tuesday, the youths accused the pastor of masterminding the disappearance of male organs  in the community. About noon they mobilised and set ablaze the Divine Shadow Church. At press time, elders in the community  were making efforts to calm the youths. A police source told The Nation that it has not been  medically proven that anyone can cause a body organ to disappear, and appealed to the youths to give peace a chance. The youths also barricaded the Makurdi-Lafia federal highway and made bonfires. There was traffic gridlock  on the highway following the blockage  of the only road that links Benue  with Nasarawa state.
