Ogun State has commenced Nigeria’s second African Union-African peer Review (AU-APRM) Self-Assessment Process which will allow residents of the state in all the 20 Local Government Areas to evaluate government performance with the aim of improving governance. Performing the flag off of the programme in Abeokuta, Commissioner for Industry, Trade and Investment, Mrs. Kikelomo Longe said the review which is coming about 13 years after Nigeria had its first in 2008 would foster adoption of policies which would promote political and socio-economic stability. Mrs. Longe added that the Focal Point People (FPP) have been assigned in all the 20 local government areas to guide stakeholders in filling assessment questionnaires adding that the questionnaires have been designed to help respondents assess government under four thematic areas which include: Democracy and Political Governance; Economic Governance and Management; Corporate Governance and Socio-Economic Development. She appealed to respondents to carry out the assessment without any form of sentiment noting that the exercise is not a “naming or shaming” exercise but one which is geared towards improvement in governance. Also speaking, the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment, Mr. Olu. Ola. Aikulola urged the FPP to be neutral while providing necessary guidance to the respondents of the self-assessment questionnaires. Aikulola added that the outcome of the assessment process would help identify areas of performance and deficiency which will spur government at all levels to address identified deficiencies for better service delivery. The main flag-off of the project would be done by the state governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun during a one-day town hall meeting at a date which would be announced later.
