A High Court in Ado Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital, has sentenced one Kayode Seun, 28, to life imprisonment for kidnapping three secondary school pupils. Prosecutor Wale Fapohunda said the convicts and his collaborator, now at large, on May 2, 2018, at Ayetoro-Ekiti in Ido/Osi council area of the  state, kidnapped three secondary school girls from their school premises. One of the victims said she and her three friends went to urinate during break time when three men descended from a tree, held them and tied their mouth before passersby came to their rescue. After listening to both the prosecuting and defence counsel, Justice Abiodun Adesodun said he observed that all the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses indicted the convict. The court held that the prosecution proved the case of kidnapping against the convict beyond all reasonable doubt.
