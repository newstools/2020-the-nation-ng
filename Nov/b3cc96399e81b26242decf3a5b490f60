Former Anambra State Governor Peter Obi is to appear before the State Judicial Panel of Enquiry on police brutality, extra-judicial killings and other related matters. The panel hinted this on Thursday following allegations leveled against him by a victim of the disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) and owner of the demolished Upper Class Hotel in Onitsha, Chief Bonaventure Mokwe. The hotelier alleged that Obi ordered the police to demolish his hotel without prior investigation indicting him. He alleged that the former governor was influenced by some powerful people in Onitsha. Following his narration, the panel chairman, Justice V. N. Umeh, told the victim’s counsel, Prof Umeh Nweke, to seek an addendum to their earlier petition instead of the narration that would gulp the panel’s time. The chairman assured the victim that everyone mentioned in the case, including the police, would be invited to appear before the panel. Before the panel moved to other petitions, it gave Mokwe up to 26 November, 2020, to file his addendum.
