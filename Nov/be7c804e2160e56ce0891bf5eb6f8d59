 DELTA Governor  Ifeanyi Okowa  has said that politics is behind President Muhammadu Buhari’s refusal to sign the Electoral Amendment Act before the 2019 general election. He described politicians generally as ‘selfish ‘, adding that politicians deliberately avoid actions that are capable of undermining their personal interests, even if this is detrimental to common good. Okowa expressed optimism that the Electoral Act would be signed on time for the next election. He said, “The Electoral Act was not signed because of politics, politicians are selfish. If you watch what is going on in America, President Trump does not want the mailing votes to be counted if they arrive after 8PM on Election Day. But members of the Democratic Party think otherwise. “That is the way of politicians, always be conscious to avoid taking actions and decisions that would undo you. So it was not signed because of politics but I know that it will be signed this time.” The governor who spoke in Asaba while addressing youths in Delta North at a town hall meeting, following the #EndSARS protests, told the youths that politics was about learning along the line and picking the good things seen in good politicians and throwing away the bad ideas. “I agree that there is a need to re-work our electoral processes but we need to re-engineer our minds because we have lost it and it’s time we began to talk to ourselves. “You must truly begin to organise yourselves in truth with a common goal and focus and whoever you select must stand for the common good of others. “We are building a new Nigeria with the youths and we must shun acts capable of reducing us when we leave office. “We will continue to allow youths, including females, to be part of the governance process because in learning you are building yourself for the future.”
