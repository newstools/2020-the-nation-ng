 MANCHESTER United legend Wayne Rooney has taken another step towards management after Derby County parted company with boss Phillip Cocu. United’s all-time top scorer Rooney was player-coach under Cocu, who has left the Rams “by mutual consent” along with assistant manager Chris van der Weerden and specialist first-team coach Twan Scheepers. Derby are bottom of the Championship table, with only one win and six points from their opening 11 games. Derby weren’t in action this weekend due to the international break. Following Cocu’s departure, Derby have confirmed Rooney will form part of the interim management team ahead of next weekend’s clash with Bristol City.
