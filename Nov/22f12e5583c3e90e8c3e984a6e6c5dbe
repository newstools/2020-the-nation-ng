 LIONEL Messi scored twice and played a key part in another goal in Barcelona’s 5-2 LaLiga win over 10-man Real Betis after being left out of Ronald Koeman’s starting line-up for the first time. Barca assistant Alfred Schreuder put the absence of Messi, who has struggled for form this season, down to a lack of fitness as he started a league game on the bench for the first time since September 2019. The mercurial forward was brought on at half-time with the game poised at 1-1 after Ousmane Dembele’s strike was cancelled out by Barca academy product Antonio Sanabria, either side of an Antoine Griezmann penalty miss. Messi paved the way for Griezmann’s goal 194 seconds into the second half, then scored a penalty after Aissa Mandi was dismissed for handling the ball on the line and doubled his tally late on to kill off Betis following Loren Moron’s strike. Pedri then capped a much-improved display for Koemen’s side with a fifth goal late on as they secured a first league wins in five on Saturday.
