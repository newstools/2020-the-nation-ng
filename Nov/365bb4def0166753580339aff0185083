The Chief Executive Officer/National Librarian, Prof Lenrie Aina, who made the donations, said the gesture was part of effort to enhance reading culture among Nigerians.

According to him, to fulfil that promise, the NLN had earmarked a donation of books to each of the Correctional Centres visited worth N50, 000. The national liberian promised to continue to support inmates in order to improve their lives. In his remarks, the Comptroller- General expressed appreciation and commended the efforts by the national library of Nigeria.
