A dramatic 93rd penalty denied the champions three points against Brighton on Saturday. Klopp warned last week the fixture scheduling means they may not finish the season with 11 players. And Milner, who started the game in midfield and moved to right-back, suffered a muscle injury in the second half to add to their defensive injury concerns. They made six changes from their 2-0 defeat by Atalanta on Wednesday, a game which had involved several fringe players, for this one. The Reds did not create many chances, with six shots – only two on target – but Jota’s goal did look like it was going to be enough until the late drama. Robertson tried to clear the ball but instead caught Welbeck’s foot. There was definitely contact although it would not have been given in a pre-VAR world. Brighton are often made to pay for missed chances. Only Liverpool, Leeds and Manchester City have had more shots than the Seagulls’ 123 this season. But despite that, they sit just two places outside the relegation zone. Nobody could really argue they fully merited a point against the champions. The lively Aaron Connolly – who appeared furious at being replaced in the second half – ran onto Maupay’s long ball before curling just wide. The Irishman was then fouled by Neco Williams for the penalty which Maupay missed. Maupay’s day got worse when he suffered a hamstring injury. He is the first player to start a Premier League game, miss a penalty, and be replaced before half-time since Dennis Bergkamp against Derby in April 1998. Brighton eventually earned a dramatic point through Gross’ penalty to take them onto 10 points.
