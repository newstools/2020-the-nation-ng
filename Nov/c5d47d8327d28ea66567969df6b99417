The Kaduna State High Court sitting in Zaria, has dismissed the application brought before it by the topmost contender in the race for Zazzau throne, Alhaji Bashir Aminu, the Iyan Zazzau, asking the court to stop the state government from installing Ambassador Ahmad Nuhu Bamalli as the 19th Emir of Zazzau. In his ruling which lasted for one hour, the presiding judge, Justice Kabir Dabo ruled that the court’s refusal to grant the applicant request was taken out of the best interest of the Emirate and its people. “The refusal of the court to grant the plaintiff his request was in the interest of peace and security and to avert any possible crisis in the Emirate.” It also held that granting the application could create a vacuum in Zazzau Emirship stool which would possibly not go down well with subjects of the Emirate and could ignite crisis and breach of security to the domain. The court also held that refusal of the injunction was better than granting it as it could push the subjects of the Emirate in crisis when the vacuum of the emirship is created. Thus, Justice Dabo adjourned the case till 18th, November, 2020 for accelerated hearing on the substantive suit. Meanwhile, arrangements are on top gear for the coronation of the new Emir which is expected to hold on the 9th, November, 2020 in Zaria.
