 EDO state governor, Godwin Obaseki, is preparing for his November 12 inauguration, while assuring that human capital development will dominate his second term. He noted that the inauguration, along with that of his deputy, Philip Shaibu, would hold alongside the annual Alaghodaro Summit. Obaseki, yesterday in a press statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Communication Strategy, Crusoe Osagie, noted that the inauguration was fused with the yearly Alaghodaro Summit to showcase the “numerous” achievements, reforms and initiatives of his administration and engage with key stakeholders in assessing progress made in the governor’s first term in office. He reassured that his government would in the second term continue on the economic trajectory of fiscal discipline and prudence, prioritisation of human capital projects and driving impactful social welfare programmes. Edo governor noted that the Alaghodaro Summit, in its fourth edition, was anchored on his “Making Edo Great Again” manifesto, thereby focusing on the government’s delivery on promises in education, healthcare and job creation, among others. He said: “Plans are in top gear for the inauguration. Benin City has become a beehive of activities. The Alaghodaro Summit, which showcases reforms, policies and programmes implemented by the administration, aims at opening up the space for private investment, inclusive economic growth and improvement of the people’s livelihood.” Obaseki also stated that giving priority to human capital development in his second term was part of efforts to place Edo state on a sustainable path of development and economic prosperity. He said: “In the next four years, we will consolidate on the achievements recorded in basic education, as more teachers are being recruited to teach in rural and remote communities, under the Edo Supporting Teachers to Achieve Results (Edo STAR) teaching fellowship programme across the state’s three senatorial districts.”
