 SMARTING from two Europa League goals from two matches, Sivasspor of Turkey striker, Olanrewaju Kayode, is looking forward to rekindle his fine form against Hatayspor in a league match on Monday. Kayode has continued to sizzle in front of goal, scoring in Sivasspor’s 2-1 loss to Maccabi Telaviv in the Europa League on Thursday. Spotting a protective mask to cover an injury to the nose incurred during a Super Lig match, Kayode, on loan to the Turkish Super Lig side from Ukrainian team Shakhar Donetsk, scored the opening goal off a pass from Ivorian Max Gradel. Kayode’s second straight goal in Europe this season, came in the 55th minute after a barren first-half at the New Sivas 4 Eylul Stadium. Sivasspor stay third in Group I after two games while Villarreal, who defeated Sivasspor 5-3 in the opening match of the Europa League, with Kayode scoring the first for the Turkish side, top the table, with more goals than Maccabi Tel Aviv. Still looking to open his goal scoring account for Sivasspor this term, Kayode, hopes to steer his team to three points back when they confront Hatayspor in a league match on Monday. Three days after, they battle Qarabag in the Europa League, with all eyes on Kayode to continue his remarkable scoring journey in Europe’s second club competition.
