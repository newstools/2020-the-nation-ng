 EKO Radio party, an annual event put together by Eko FM, has been canceled for this year. The chairman of the organising committee, Betiku Oluwatobi Austin a.k.a Dj Turbo D told The Nation. Turbo D said the decision to cancel this year’s edition of the annual event is due to the Covid-19 pandemic. He said the committee has decided to suspend the show until the deadly virus is no more. “Eko Radio Party would not hold this year due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. To control the pandemic, the government issued a mandatory lockdown which has set some businesses and plans but on the positive side, we have been able to control the pandemic to a large extent in Nigeria. Social Distancing is a must at this time and so a gathering of a lot of people would be putting people at risk of contracting or spreading the virus”, said Dj Turbo D. Continuing, he said, “Last year we had a shutdown show at the Eko Fm Premises with about 1000 radio listeners, other media houses and supporting brands from all parts of Nigeria. Some of the activities that night includes several indoor games, non-stop music, comedies, eating and drinking, and dancing. To everyone that played a part in the success of last year’s Dj’s music Fest, most especially my oga at the Top General manager Mrs Ayo Shotonwa, I say thank you all. Next year will be a Great One. I Pray for Peace in the land, we shall win this Amen. Do not forget to wash your hands, always use your mask, and practice social distancing. Thank you all”.
