A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) Mr. Chris Udofia has chided the All Progressives Congress(APC) in Akwa Ibom for boycotting last Saturday’s local government election. Udofia, a former chairman of Uyo local government area, said the APC would have used the council election to muster grassroot support as well its political relevance ahead of the 2023 general elections. He spoke on Saturday shortly casting his ballot at Ward 12 Unit 13 in Uyo local government area. Udofia commended Governor Udom Emmanuel and the Akwa Ibom Independent Electoral Commission(AKISIEC) for promoting democratic participation for all political parties to contest the election. ”You give democracy to people who don’t understand but they throw it away. How can a whole political party as APC refused to participate in a local government elections? ”This was supposed to be another chance for them to show relevance in the state”, he said. The former council boss alsp commended AKISIEC for the smooth conduct of council poll, adding that such performance was unprecedented in the history of the state. He said voting commenced simultaneously with accreditation of voters at exactly 8am as women , youths and elders queued to vote for leaders of their choices.
