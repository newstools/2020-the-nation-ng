A new show tagged Investment Chat in a Rolls-Royce with Stephen Akintayo is set to premiere on Nigerian screens and online via Youtube and Facebook on Sunday, November 22. The show, produced with the sum of N30 million is directed by Bunmi Davies with Stephen Akintayo of the Gtext fame being the Executive Producer and Host. A first of its kind celebrity guest show, every week, the celebrity guest takes a luxurious ride with Akintayo in a Rolls-Royce while discussing matters of investment. Speaking on what inspired the show, he said, “One of the reasons why we started this show was that we realised that investment conversations are quite boring. People all over the world are attracted to luxury, but they don’t know what goes on before luxury comes. We then decided to mix the two by showing our audience the luxury while telling them the truth about investment. That gets people’s attention and helps us educate people on investment in a fun, luxurious way.” Going further, Akintayo, explained that while the show is not a one-stop-shop for everything about investment, it is majorly to get conversations on investment going, seeing as many consider the topic of investment uninteresting and sometimes technical. With screen icons and entertainment industry stakeholders speaking on investment, many more people are likely to listen, especially since many of them would be sharing from personal experience. Going by the trailer, the audience is in for an engaging screen experience as already, personalities like star actress, Joke Silva; comedian cum actor, Gbenga Adeyinka GCFR; media personality cum politician, Dayo Adeneye; and screen icon, Ada Ameh; have been spotted taking a ride in a Rolls-Royce with Akintayo. Premiering on Channel Television this Sunday at 2:30 pm, the show is the latest, quality addition to Nigeria’s repertoire of educational programmes.
