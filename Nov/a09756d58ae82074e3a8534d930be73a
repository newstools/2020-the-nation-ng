Boxers billed for the seven scheduled bouts in the GOtv Boxing Night 21 holding  today at the Rowe Park Sports Centre in Lagos have been talking tough. The event, which will be broadcast live on SuperSport Select 2 (channel 34) and DStv channel 209, will hold behind closed doors in line with Covid-1 Policeman Prince “Lion” Nwoye, who is billed to take on West African Boxing Union (WABU) lightweight champion, Rilwan “Real One” Oladosu, has declared that his opponent’s winning streak will end today.  Oladosu, who is yet to taste defeat as a professional, defeated Nwoye in a closely contested bout at GOtv Boxing Night 15. Though he lost the fight, Nwoye managed to curtail the volume punching of the WABU champion and did not buckle, as his previous opponents had done, till the end of the eight-round bout. Meanwhile, former African Boxing Union (ABU) light welterweight champion, Olaide “Fijaborn” Fijabi, has vowed to make his opponent, Dennis “The Range” Mbat, regret ever fighting him. Fijabi, who is returning to the ring after two years, said he is aiming to regain the continental title and later win the Commonwealth title. A similar boast was made by WABU welterweight champion, Rilwan “Baby Face” Babatunde, who said he will use his opponent, Jubril “Terrible Olalekan, to warm up for his ABU title bid.
