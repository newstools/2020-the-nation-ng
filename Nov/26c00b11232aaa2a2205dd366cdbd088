 IT was the turn of men and women of Hausa community in Agege Local Government, Lagos, to benefit from the ongoing Spotlight Initiative campaign against Domestic Violence and all forms of violence against women and girls last week. The open air campaign and house-to-house outreach took off from the palace of Alhaji Muhammadu Musa  Dogonkadai, the Sarkin Hausawa of Agege and chairman, Council of Arewa  Chiefs in Agege, comprising Hausa, Igala, Ibira, Nupe and other northern and middle belt tribes. The facilitator, Adeyemi Temidayo, alerted  the womenfolk that the days of brutalising women and children is over. He said: “No man has a right to force you into a relationship or force you to do anything against your wish simply because you are a woman. The government is saying ‘no’ to all forms of violence against women and girls and all forms of sexual violence.” On the other hand, he warned both men and women against abuse of children in the name of discipline, rape and other forms of sexual abuse, adding that violators will be made to face the law. He also enlightened them on what steps to take when faced with such situation. For starters, he informed them that the Sarkin Hausawa is fully aware and in support of the campaign. He also told them that they can make use of members of Agege Community Surveillance Team, made of respected men and women in the community, when faced with such situations. The Sarkin Hausawa commended the team and reiterated his support for the programme. The Personal Assistant to the Sarkin, Musa Dan Sarki volunteered as translator.
