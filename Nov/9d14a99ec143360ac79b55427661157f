 RENAULT has announced the sale of its first two “medium duty” electric trucks to bakery Warburtons and recycling firm Suez. Both D ZE models, the Warburtons vehicle were a 16-tonne unit with a box body with rear side door and tail-lift by PPS Commercials. It is due to join what the company describes as its secondary bread fleet and will carry approximately six tonnes of bread and bakery products to locations around London. Suez’s vehicle is a 26-tonne D Wide ZE refuse truck, which the company plans to use for waste collection services in Bristol city centre for transport to its recycling and reprocessing site. Both trucks are due to enter service later this year. “Warburtons and SUEZ are not only household names and leaders in their respective sectors, but leaders in the sustainability journey which we must all embrace,” said Renault Trucks Managing Director Carlos Rodrigues said. “We are hugely excited to be announcing the sales of these first two fully electric vehicles today, and look forward to many other organisations joining us in the coming months.”
