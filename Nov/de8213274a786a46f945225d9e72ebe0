Governors of several United States (U.S.) states are instituting new restrictions to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus, with the national case count surpassing 11 million infections. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer announced a ban on indoor dining, in-person classes for high school and college students, and public events at casinos and movie theatres. At-home gatherings are limited to 10 people. “We are in the worst moment of this pandemic to date,” Whitmer told reporters. “The situation has never been more dire. We are at the precipice and we need to take some action.” In the northwestern state of Washington, Governor Jay Inslee also banned indoor dining and ordered retail stores to limit the number of customers allowed to 25% capacity.  Outdoor gatherings are limited to five people, while indoor gatherings not involving people from the same household are prohibited. Also on Monday, Chancellor Angela Merkel imposed tougher limits on public and private gatherings as Germany struggles to stem the coronavirus spread. Merkel and the premiers of Germany’s 16 states agreed that people should refrain from all unnecessary social contact, including gettogethers at home and in public spaces. “A turning point hasn’t been reached” in Germany’s outbreak,” Merkel said yesterday after more than five hours of talks.
