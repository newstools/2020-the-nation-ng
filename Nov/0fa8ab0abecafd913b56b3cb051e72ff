 AN advocacy group, Ethanrose Foundation is set to take cancer awareness campaign to communities in Bayelsa State to help prevent the dreaded disease. The foundation said over 140 cases of breast cancer had been diagnosed with over 30 deaths recorded between January 2018 and October 2020 in the state. In collaboration with the wife of the state governor, Patience Diri, who is also the Life Patron, the foundation held a breast cancer awareness trek and free test for women at the Peace Park, Yenagoa, the state capital, with a call on women to observe regular checks. In her remarks, the Executive Secreatry, Ethanrose Foundation, Annette David-West, said early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer generally increases the chances for successful treatment.
