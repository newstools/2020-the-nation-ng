When three powerful kings in Yorubaland pay you a visit, it brings a special feeling. That was the exact feeling Reverend Mother Abimbola Esther Ajayi and her husband, Ademuyiwa Ajayi, had a few days ago, when they played host to Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, Oniru of Iruland, Oba Gbolahan Lawal and Oba Saheed Ademola, Elegushi of Ikate-Elegushi Kingdom, in their new Lekki home. The visit amid fanfare was barely a week after they hosted former President Olusegun Obasanjo. The Ooni has always shown Reverend Ajayi great love and support. Whenever she reaches out to the king, he hardly ever fails her.
