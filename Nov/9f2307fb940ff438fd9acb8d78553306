 NIGERIAN youngster Paul Mukairu on Sunday enjoyed a dream start to life in Belgium after he scored a magical match winner for Anderlecht to bring high-riding Royal Antwerp crashing, reports SCORENigeria. Antwerp have been on an all-time high after they shocked star-studded Premier League side Tottenham in the UEFA Europa League Thursday. However, it was little known Nigerian striker Mukairu who brought them crashing down to earth to announce his arrival on the big stage in Belgium with a long-range blaster in the 76th minute on his debut for Anderlecht. The 20-year-old striker, who is on a season-long loan from Turkish club Antalyaspor with option for Anderlecht to buy permanently, was brought on in the 62nd minute. Anderlecht are now fifth on the table with 20 points from 11 matches.
