Abductors of some traders along the Akure-Owo highway have reduced the ransom for their release from N11m to N5m. They abducted 16 persons last Saturday but the Ondo State Police Command said it rescued 10 and arrested four members of the kidnapped gang. One of the victim was said to have managed to escape. Among those still in the kidnappersâ€™ den is the Iyaloja of Isua, Akoko South East local government, Chief Hellen Edward. The traders were returning from Akure when they were abducted. But the driver was allowed to tell their families to pay N11m ransom. One of her children, who gave her name as Mrs Alaba, said her mother spoke to family members and urged them to look for the ransom for her release. Alaba said they were happy when they heard news of the rescue of some victims by the police but later discovered that her mother was still in captivity. Mrs Alaba said the N5m demanded by the kidnappers was too much for the poor families to pay. Ondo Police spokesman, ASP Tee-Leo Ikoro, said the policemen and other security agencies were combing the forest to secure release of the victims. Ikoro said the Police Commissioner, Salami Bolaji, has ordered all police Divisions in Akoko area to deploy maximum men to the forest as well as secure the highway in the area.
