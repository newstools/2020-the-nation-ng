An Akure High Court presided over by Justice Samuel Bola has sentenced one Alo Olusola to life imprisonment for raping his daughter. The convict was said to have started have sexual intercourse with his daughter from the age of 10. It was learnt that the victim’s mother left her when she was six months old. The rape saga was exposed when the victim opened up at a student’s fellowship meeting that somebody was already having sex with her. She was said to have narrated that her father would demand for sex anytime she requested money from him for school fees, self-medication books or personal upkeep. The court was informed that it was the victim’s school principal that reported to the police before her father was arrested but pleaded not guilty to the one count charge of rape preferred against him. In his judgement, Justice Bola held that the evidence of the victim that the defendant demanded sexual intercourse from her before he acceded to her requests was true. Justice Bola said the defendant did not adduce any oral evidence to deny the evidence of his daughter or defend himself. He found the defendant guilty as charged and sentenced him to life imprisonment.
