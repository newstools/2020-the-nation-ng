 LEWIS Hamilton is finally set to be awarded a knighthood in the New Year’s honours list. The Formula One ace secured a record equalling seventh world title at the Turkish Grand Prix last weekend. There have been growing calls for Hamilton to  be knighted following his sporting success on the track. And when previously asked about receiving such praise he said: “When I think about that honour I think about people like my grand-dad who served in the war.” The 35-year-old is among the UK’s most successful sportsman following several years of front running since making the move to Mercedes in 2013. Hamilton now holds Formula One records for the most wins, which he set earlier this season, and pole positions after winning the  world title for six of the past seven years.
