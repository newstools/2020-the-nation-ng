For those who know Mariam Afolabi, the daughter of maritime guru and vice chairman of SIFAX groups, Dr. Taiwo Afolabi, it won’t be an overstatement saying she is an established die-hard fashion and art enthusiast. To show how much she admires fashion and arts, she launched her multi-million Naira fashion complex, The Style Café. However, the elegant and alluring Mariam has been missing in action for some time. Birds around town chirped on her recent engagement saying her new portfolio in the SIFAX group is fast taking much of her time. Sources close to her disclosed that she has not completely abandoned her passion for fashion saying her 2018 appointment as the Executive Director of Compliance SIFAX Groups is her current focus. “Mariam no longer has much time for fashion. The job description that comes with her office is quite a tasking one. It requires time and attention. She wants to build a portfolio for herself in the maritime sector. Fashion never fades. It can come anytime. She is still young, so she is only concentrating on building her father’s shipping conglomerate. She might have reduced some of her activities but trust me, she is still a fashion enthusiast. It’s inborn so you don’t expect it to fade away like that. With time, she will bounce back,” the source hinted. Mariam won’t be forgotten on the social scene with her exquisite The Style Café, which houses a fashion label, Mademoiselle Aglaia, a unisex salon, a beauty parlour, a spa, and an eatery where local and intercontinental foods are served in highbrow Lekki Phase 1, Lagos. Unknown to many, young and savvy Afolabi commands attention with every step, not because of her fashion statements, composure, gait, and charming smile but her resume which is rich and laudable. a graduate of Law from the University of Warwick, Coventry, England, Mariam also obtained a Post Graduate degree (LLM with distinction) in International Maritime Law from the IMO International Maritime Law Institute, Malta.
