 A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ondo State, Mr. Solomon Bitire, has said the party has already lost the governorship election before October 10. Bitire, a former chairman in Okitipupa Local Government, said no deputy governor could produce the stimulus needed by Ondo South Senatorial District even if thousands of deputy governors were picked from the region. Speaking at a summit organised by Ondo South youths in Okitipupa, he said Ondo South has suffered much due to political marginalisation. Bitire said the only way to right the wrong was for the district to produce the governor. He said: “If thousands of deputy governors are produced by our region, it can’t give us the necessary stimulus we need in Ondo South. Ondo South is lagging behind in everything and there are no other means to solve our challenges than to produce a governor.  “Don’t be deceived, a deputy governor is a spare tyre whose survival is at the discretion of his boss, the governor. I saw it all when I joined the advocacy for Ondo South to produce the governor. The political history of Ondo South has shown that the election of governors in the past was on the basis of turn by turn. “No senatorial district should hold sway unto power. As I have always said, where a party didn’t respect the culture of zoning by producing their candidate from the right zone, then the electorate will correct the injustices during voting. “I am a PDP man, but PDP has already lost this election before the conduct of the election on October 10 for not doing what is right. The ball is in the court of all of you to save the future of Ondo South and decide the way forward, because I, Solomon Bitire, will not do that for you. I have played my part and it is now over to you.”
