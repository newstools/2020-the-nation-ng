All Progressives Congress (APC) and its candidate Osagie Ize-Iyamu have received a major boost, as the Ndigbo in Edo State have urged the electorate to shun the Peoples Democratic Party’s (PDP’s) governorship candidate in Saturday’s election, Godwin Obaseki. This was as the Secretary-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Dimm Uche Okwukwu, enjoined Ndigbo in Edo State to support the candidature of Pastor Ize-Iyamu, citing offending acts of Governor Obaseki as part of the body’s reasons. Okwukuwu said: “Any organisation that strays from political election is doomed and not worthy to exist. This realisation informed my timely mobilisation of the Igbo in Edo State. The Igbo in Edo State include indigenes and non-indigenes. The Igbanke are indigenous; just as we have a large population of non-indigenous Igbo.”
