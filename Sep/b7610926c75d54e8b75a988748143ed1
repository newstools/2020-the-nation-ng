Edo Police Command has assured residents of security ahead of September 19 governorship election. Commissioner Johnson Kokumo, briefing the Oba of Benin, Oba Ewuare II, yesterday at his palace in Benin on the preparations for the poll, said security would be provided before, during and after the election despite the seeming rising tension. He said measures have been taken to nip in the board any incidence of violence and breakdown of law and order before, during and after the poll. Kokumo said anyone found wanting, irrespective of position, would be prosecuted. He said the Police has joined forces with sister security agencies, including the military, to ensure the election is violence free.
