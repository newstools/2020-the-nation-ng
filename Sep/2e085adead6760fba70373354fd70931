The Lagos State Government has not lifted the restrictions on opening of bars, restaurants, night clubs, lounges and cinemas, despite relaxation of the curfew to four hours by the Presidential Task Force (PTF), it was learnt on Thursday. Commissioner for Information & Strategy Gbenga Omotoso, who stated this in a statement, warned owners of hospitality establishments to restrict their operations to 50 per cent of their occupancy rate as directed by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. Omotoso also advised the operators to observe the guidelines on physical distancing, use of face masks, temperature checks and washing of hands with soap and running water as well as using hand sanitisers. According to the statement, events centre operators are also to ensure that participants at any event in their premises do not exceed 50 per cent capacity of the design of their halls while strict compliance with the two-metre spacing between seats must be strictly enforced. “The monitoring and compliance teams from the Lagos State Special Task Force will step-up enforcement to ensure that entertainment and event centres do not violate COVID-19 regulations. “Non-compliance with the guidelines on COVID-19 will attract maximum sanctions in accordance with the law,” the statement added.
