 Evicted Kiddwaya has predicted Laycon will win the show in a recent interview with African Magic. “I want Laycon to win and I think he will win, in the start I thought Neo would when I was in the House,” he said. On why he thought Laycon would win, he said: “When I actually heard his music for the first time, when they played it by then I was on my own vibe I didn’t really listen to it, I just saw people jumping around him doing this and I didnt know it was him so I think I told the DJ to turn it up and told everybody to calm down so I can hear it. When I first heard the song I realized that I see a lot of potentials in this boy and I felt like music really uplifts people, it really makes them feel high when they feel low it gets them out of tough times especially in this country and I know that with him winning I felt like he would do more with that win in terms of other people and I felt that with him winning he would do more with that win in terms of people so I felt like he would be able to really touch some peoples life no matter how low or high up.”
