Former Ondo State governor Dr. Olusegun Mimiko has described provision of quality education and health care delivery as the hallmark of good governance. He spoke when the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) governorship campaign train stopped at Okitipupa in Okitipupa Local Government. The ZLP campaign train was received by a huge crowd of party faithful and supporters when it arrived Okitipupa. Mimiko said any government that failed to prioritise education and health care delivery had failed the people. “Youths can no longer complete their education, they can’t enjoy quality education because of high tuition fees in government-owned schools. “It has become impossible for our people to enjoy free health care because of exorbitant bills at government hospitals. These are signs of bad governance,” he said. The ex-governor expressed concern about increase in tuition fees at the state owned tertiary institutions. “How can a government that met tuition fees at N25,000 unilaterally increase it to over N200,000? This development has sent many people out schools,” he said. ZLP governorship candidate Mr. Agboola Ajayi said the party would prioritise education and health care delivery. Ajayi, the deputy governor, said the citizens would enjoy free education at the primary school and secondary school levels if ZLP was elected. He said tuition fees at the tertiary level would be reduced to N50,000. Ajayi urged the residents to vote for the ZLP in the interest of good governance and effective service delivery in the October 10 governorship election.
