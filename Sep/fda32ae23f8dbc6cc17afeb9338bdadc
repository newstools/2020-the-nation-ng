 The Kwara State family court sitting in Ilorin, the state capital has docked a class teacher for alleged sexual molestation of his seven-year- old pupil. The accused, Akorede Hammed, was a teacher in a private school in Ilorin. He was dragged before the court on allegation of act of gross indecency contrary to section 285 of the penal code law. Police First Information Report revealed that the innocent girl narrated how she was molested to his father at home. In a bid to address the issue, the police report stated the victim’s father wrote a letter of complaint to the Area Command Metro, Ilorin, narrating how her daughter was allegedly sexually abused by the teacher. The girl, through the complaint, said Hammed, took her to the toilet and locked her up to conceal the crime from the knowledge of passersby. She added that Hammed removed her pant and started fiddling with her private part.  Hammed was also said to have opened the door for the girl to go after she resisted vehemently. Police investigation revealed the accused, who was the victim’s Yoruba teacher, absconded from school to an unknown place until he was later seen and arrested by the detective of the area command Metro. Absence of the victim in court stalled the proceeding as Magistrate Lawal, insisted that the girl must be physically present before the matter can go on. Kwara Governor’s wife Mrs. Folake AbdulRazaq has indicated interest in the matter. In fact, she was represented in court, International Federation of Women Lawyers and National Human Right Commission also stormed the court to watch the proceedings. They all insisted in getting justice done on the matter. Magistrate Shade Lawal in her short ruling, adjourned the matter till 16th September, 2020 for hearing.
