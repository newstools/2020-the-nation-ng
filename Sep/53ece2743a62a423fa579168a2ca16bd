Deputy Governor of Ondo State and governorship candidate of the Zenith Labour Party, Hon Agboola Ajayi, has promised to reduce tuition fees paid in the state-owned tertiary institutions to N50,000. Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu had announced a 20 percent reduction fees after an appeal by students last month but Agboola said the reduction by Akeredolu was not enough. Agboola said the tuition fees which was N25,000 before Akeredolu came to power was increased to between N150,000 and N200,000 because Akeredolu never cares for the people’s welfare. He spoke at Ore, Odigbo local government, at the campaign flag off rally of the ZLP. Agboola said he would stop the use of consultants in doing government business which he stated had made the Ondo civil service redundant. He promised a vibrant civil service by retraining them and ensure they get revolving loan. Agboola said he would return the shuttle bus services and provide for the vulnerable in the society. He urged Ondo State voters to use their PVC to sack Akeredolu’s led APC government and bring in the ZLP because he is the most qualified to be governor. Former Governor Olusegun Mimiko described Agboola as the best among all the candidates. Mimiko said Agboola would continue with all his legacy projects. The Deputy Governor also accused son of Governor Akeredolu of collecting N403m as Commission from the recovered N43bn found stashed in Zenith bank since 2008. Agboola said he would return the shuttle bus services and provide for the vulnerable in the society. He urged Ondo State voters to use their PVC to sack Akeredolu’s led APC government and bring in the ZLP because he is the most qualified to be governor.
