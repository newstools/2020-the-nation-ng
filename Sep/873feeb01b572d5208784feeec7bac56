 WIFE of Edo State Deputy Governor Mrs. Maryann Shaibu has cried out over alleged threat to her life and family by the former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole. Shaibu, in a petition through her solicitors, Idemudia Ilueminosen & Co, to Police Commissioner Lawan Jimeta, alleged that Oshiomhole did not only threaten to deal with her, but also declared that he (Oshiomhole) had sent thugs to monitor her in Etsako West Local Government, to carry out the threat of dealing with her. She urged the police to investigate the alleged threat, to bring Oshiomhole and his cohorts to book and avert harm. Oshiomhole, through his media aide, Victor Oshioke, however, described Shaibu’s wife’s petition as nothing, but a futile attempt to divert the attention of Nigerians from the trending video of Mrs. Shaibu, threatening to flog women old enough to be her mother, if they dared to exercise their rights to attend any event other than the one she organised. Oshioke said: “The petition is a calculated attempt to drag down the name of Comrade Oshiomhole. Shaibu and his wife should find another way to launder their family image, which has been badly damaged by their numerous unguarded public utterances, captured on video, threatening violence on Edo people. “Comrade Oshiomhole is a man at peace with himself and his environment. He is focused on marketing the APC governorship candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, and his SIMPLE agenda manifesto to Edo people, for their ultimate benefit.”
