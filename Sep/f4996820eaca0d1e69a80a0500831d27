Paris Saint-Germain trio Neymar, Angel Di Maria and Leandro Paredes have tested positive for coronavirus, according to reports in France. The Ligue 1 club confirmed on Wednesday three players returned a positive Covid-19 result and L’Equipe later revealed who the unfortunate players were, with the trio understood to have all enjoyed a recent holiday in Ibiza. “Three Paris Saint-Germain players have confirmed positive Sars CoV2 tests and are subject to the appropriate health protocol,” the club said in a statement. “All of the players and coaching staff will continue to undergo tests in the coming days.” The French champions on Monday said that two of their players had tested positive for the virus and gone into quarantine. Although the Ligue 1 season has kicked off, PSG have yet to begin their campaign as they have been given a break following their run to last month’s Champions League final, where they were beaten 1-0 by Bayern Munich. Positive tests have already disrupted the start of the new season, with the opening match of the campaign between Marseille and St Etienne postponed when Marseille reported four positive tests. PSG were awarded the 2019/20 title after the season was curtailed in April.(mirror.co.uk)
