According to the Presidents who spoke at the event, the focus of the sub-region is to persuade other African countries to support Nigeria’s highly respected pick for the position, one of five candidates who recently scaled the first stage of the WTO leadership hurdle. The expression of support follows the endorsement of Okonjo-Iweala by the sub-regional body in June anchored on the former World Bank Managing Director’s track record of high performance and leadership in top positions.
