Former Italian star, Roberto Rambaudi, believes  the only way any  team desirous  of stopping Napoli striker  Victor Osimhen in his flight is to adopt a double marking approach to prevent the Nigerian from utilizing  space. “Osimhen does well with certain plays, but the others also do well too but the opponents cannot leave him one on one, they must necessarily double  mark him ,” explained Rambaudi. But foremost Italian journalist, Massimo D’Alessandro said  Osimhen has brought freshness to Napoli with his pace which has put Napoli as Scudetto contender this season. D’Alessandro, who works with Radio Marte said he has been thrilled with the arrival of Osimhen in the Serie A, adding that the 21-year-old forward has added bite to the attack of Napoli. “I am thrilled by Osimhen, after seeing him also in I retired, and I saw a freshness and a joy that is transmitted to the whole team. If Koulibaly were to stay, and Osimhen were to confirm his prospects, it is not a blasphemy to think of a Napoli fighting at least for the Scudetto,” he added.
