One hundred and eleven people were killed by Lassa fever and Coronavirus in Ondo State within the last eight months. Available records showed that 31 deaths were recorded from COVID-19 related illnesses and 80 deaths from Lassa fever infections from January till date. Acting Commissioner for Health Dr. Jibayo Adeyeye gave the figures while hosting a team from the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). The NCDC team was in Ondo State to inspect the ongoing molecular biology laboratory and the new isolation centre projects at the University of Medical Sciences Teaching Hospital, Ondo town. Dr. Adeyeye said Lassa fever disease was more ravaging than the much-feared COVID-19 due to statistics of deaths recorded from both diseases According to him, “The Lassa fever is a big problem more than the Covid-19 in our state. The statistics at our disposal show that from January till date, 31 deaths have been ascribed to COVID-19 in Ondo State. At this same period, we found about 80 deaths from Lassa fever. “Of the people that were positive of COVID-19, less than two per cent of them died, but 27 per cent of those that were positive of Lassa fever died. You can now imagine which one is more of a problem. We are not saying COVID 19 is not a problem, it is a problem. But we cannot say because COVID-19 is a problem and we neglect other problems peculiar to us as a state. “That is why the governor gave the order to build this infrastructure (lab) to make sure that whatever infectious disease that we may have in the state we will be able overcome it.” Vice-Chancellor of the UNIMED Prof. Adesegun Fatusi said isolation centres would be built in each of the senatorial districts.
