Its Group Managing Director, Mrs. Tokunbo Fagbemi who disclosed this said the company took the steps as part of its five-year transformation plan to retool for enhanced service delivery.

Fagbemi said: “Our plan is to make NAHCO customer-centric, and with this renovation, as well as the ongoing equipment purchase, we are providing our clients a conducive environment to operate from. We are also coming up with fresh innovations to offer our numerous clients better deals, and retain a minimum of 65 percent market share in aviation ground handling business’’. Speaking on the latest deliveries, the GMD attributed the Company’s current low run to the Covid-19 pandemic which has adversely impacted the Company’s operations, notwithstanding,’’ we will continue to strive for excellence at all times. This is just part of the equipment being expected, some more will be delivered in the coming days. The era of inadequate equipment is sure to be over soon.” Fagbemi said NAHCO’s five – year transformation plan was on course, though with a significant slowdown as a result of the closure of the airports due to Covid-19. She said the Company is however very optimistic to scale through the hurdle.
