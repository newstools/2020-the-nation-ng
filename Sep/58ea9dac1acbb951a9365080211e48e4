TGI Cares Fund, an employee-led charity initiative of Tropical General Investments (TGI) Group, on Thursday said it had started providing one million free meals in communities struggling with the economic impact of COVID-19. It said its focus is on vulnerable persons in communities nationwide which have been left without a steady source of livelihood by the pandemic, by supporting them during and beyond the economic crisis. TGI Cares Fund Group Human Resources Director and Coordinator of TGI, Tominiyi Oni, stated this in Lagos while handing over food items to FoodClique Support Initiative, an organisation that identifies and reaches out to the most vulnerable in communities. “We are proud of our people who birthed this noble idea. These are difficult times, so I am elated that my colleagues have pooled resources together to kickstart this charity drive,” he said. Receiving the items on behalf of FoodClique Support Initiative, Team Lead, Bolajoko Fadipe, expressed gratitude for the gesture. He appreciated employees of TGI Group, promising proper distribution of the food items to the most vulnerable in low-income communities across the country. In its first phase, 280,000 meals have been provided for children, unemployed youths and women in Lagos State, TGI said. Phase two of the charity drive will extend to other communities in the North.
