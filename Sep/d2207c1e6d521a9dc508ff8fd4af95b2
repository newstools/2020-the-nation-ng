 EDO elite, under the auspices of Concerned Elite Citizens of United Ogbe, have hailed Governor Godwin Obaseki, the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), for his purposeful leadership style and landmark achievements. The elite comprising retired professors, directors, engineers, lawyers and permanent secretaries of Ogbe origin, in a statement issued on Tuesday at a news conference in Benin City, said they are “not unaware of the unveiled manipulations, many of which are utterly illogical by the former national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Aliyu Oshiomhole. We emphatically reject in its entirety, the tendency to lock two Benin sons in a game of death.” The statement was signed by lziengbe Eghomwan, an engineer; Sunday lyalekhue, Peter Obobaifo, Efe Thomas Obanor, Godwin Okpefa and David Nosa lmafidon, on behalf of Ogbenaghidi Brothers and United Ogbe People. They said: “We are particularly alarmed to know that most of the opposing foot soldiers on the different platforms and parties are Ogbe young people and we cannot afford to be in self-denial to lose any of our children. Hence, we make this order, not appeal.”
