A former Ondo State Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice in the administration of Dr. Olusegun Mimiko, Mr Remi Olatubora, has resigned his membership of the opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP). His resignation is coming 24 hours after a former governorship aspirant and state spokesman of the PDP, Banji Okunomo resigned and joined the Zenith Labour Party. It was gathered that Olatubora submitted his resignation letter to his party’s ward Chairman, Apostle Medunoye, last Saturday afternoon. Olatubora, before his resignation, was the leader of the PDP in Irele Local Government. He once served as chairman of Ondo State Sports Council and a later became Commissioner for Adult and Vocation Education before he was appointed Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice in Ondo State. One of his aides who confirmed the resignation said many PDP leaders in the locality would soon abandon the party and head for the ZLP. The aide said Olatubora was yet to make up his mind on which party to join even though governorship candidate, Agboola Ajayi, has reached out to him.
