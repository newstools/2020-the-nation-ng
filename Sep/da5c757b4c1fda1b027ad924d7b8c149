Stunned by the decision of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to cut the benchmark interest rate,bewildered investors dumped fixed-income instruments and rushed to the equities market, pushing equities to their best performance in four months. After five trading sessions of successive gains, Nigerian equities closed weekend with net capital gain of N390 billion, with average gain for the week at 2.92 per cent. The momentum of activities at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) also increased considerably with turnover volume and value rising by 46 per cent and 69 per cent. The performance of Nigerian stocks was a silver lining in the slowdown in global equities markets with most advanced and emerging markets in America and Europe closing negative. United States’ benchmarks- Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and S & P declined by 3.0 per cent and 2.2 per cent. United Kingdom’s FTSE 100 Index also posted negative return of -2.7 per cent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 depreciated by 0.7 per cent. The broad MSCI EM Index-which tracks emerging markets, closed with average negative return of -4.6 per cent. The CBN cut its Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) by 100 basis points to 11.5 per cent on Tuesday, in a surprise move that further heightened uncertainties in disconcerted fixed-income market. The apex bank stated that the rate cut was necessary to increase credit to the production sector of the economy in furtherance of its role in lessening the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and global fluctuations. With dividend yields of several quoted equities above fixed-income returns, attractive valuations of Nigerian stocks and steady operational performance by headlining companies, the shift to equities was sharp and swift. Cordros Securities attributed the rally at the equities market to portfolio adjustments in favour of equities amid sharp drop in fixed-income yields following further monetary easing by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the CBN. “We expect the market might continue to benefit as domestic investors seek alpha-yielding opportunities in the face of increasingly negative real returns in the fixed income market. However, we advise investors to trade in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro environment remains a significant headwind for listed companies,” Cordros Securities stated in a weekend advisory review. Aggregate market value of all quoted equities at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) rose from the week’s opening value of N13.365 trillion to close weekend at N13.755 trillion, indicating net gain of N390 billion or 2.9 per cent. The All Share Index (ASI)- the value-based common index that tracks all share prices at the NSE, rose successively to close weekend at 26,319.34 points, its best performance since March 2020. It had opened the week at 25,572.57 points, indicating average gain of 2.92 per cent for the week. Senior Research Analyst, FXTM, Lukman Otunuga, said the rate slash caught investors off-guard as they were expecting to remain unchanged for the rest of the year and early 2021. Trading data at the weekend showed a market-wide rally as open market orders saw most deals closing at premium.
