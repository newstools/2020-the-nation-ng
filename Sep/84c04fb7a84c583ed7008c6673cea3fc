The West African Examination Council (WAEC) has conducted the 2020 Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) in Chibok, Borno State, six years after closure due to insurgency. Brig.-Gen. Abdul-Khalifa Ibrahim, Acting General Officer Commanding (GOC), 7 Division, Nigerian Army, stated this while hosting members of Education in Emergency Working Group Nigeria (EiEWGN), yesterday in Maiduguri.  Chibok schools were closed after over 200 pupils were abducted by the Boko Haram terrorists from the Government Girls Secondary School in 2014.
