Kiddwaya has reacted to his eviction from the House. Kiddwaya was evicted after Prince on the eighth Sunday live eviction. Speaking to the show host, Ebuka, the billionaire son said he feels other Housemates voted him out because they think he doesn’t need the N85 million prize. “I feel they voted me out because they feel I don’t need the money. “Maybe because our stories are different, they thought I shouldn’t be in the House. To me, meeting people is my primary goal it’s never about money,” he said. He also addressed his relationship with Nengi. According to him: “We eat together, we drink together, we dance together but people’s paranoid make it look like me and she have something. Ozo has spoken to me a couple of times. I don’t know how she feels about me but from my point there’s nothing.”
