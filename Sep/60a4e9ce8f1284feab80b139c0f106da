The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ondo State has dismissed allegation its governorship candidate, Eyitayo Jegede, was pursuing what is known as the Akure agenda. It said anybody making the allegation was attempting to localise a state issue. The PDP challenged any political opponents to state how Jegede campaigned with the Akure agenda issue. Ondo PDP spokesman, Kennedy Peretei, said the victory of Jegede at the party’s primary was based on his antecedents and what Jegede is coming to offer. Peretei challenged the ruling APC to campaign with its achievements rather than localising state issues. His words: “Anybody saying PDP is pursuing Akure agenda is trying to localise a state issue. There is nowhere the candidate has gone to say he is from Akure. “At the primaries, he won majority votes from other senatorial districts. He came out with a convincing victory. It is a ticket based on his personality, it is a ticket based on antecedent and what he is coming to offer. “His aspiration is not Akure based. It will not be correct to say he is pursuing Akure Agenda. Yes, Akure has the largest voting population in the state. They can take advantage of that but not Akure agenda. “APC should go and check their records. At the last local government election, they got so much resistance despite contesting against themselves. They should tell us which area they performed.”
