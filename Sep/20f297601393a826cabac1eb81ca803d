The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Taraba has declared former Minister of Women Affairs, Mrs. Aisha Alhassan popularly known as Mama Taraba, as irrelevant in political calculations in the state. Taraba APC chairman, Hon. Ibrahim El-Sudi, declared Alhassan politically inconsequential while addressing newsmen in Abuja after a meeting of stakeholders with the Chairman of the Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary National Convention Planning Committee (CENCPC), Governor Mai Mala Buni. El-Sudi said the refusal of the former governorship candidate to return will not affect the fortunes of the party because other stalwarts are strongly in support of the leadership of the party in the state. The APC leader said the party is set to reclaim the state going by the rate at which people are showing interest in joining. “You can see that all the juggernauts, movers, and shakers, all the caterpillars and bulldozers of the APC in the state are here with me and there is no way only one person who does not want to accept the reality will be greater than them. “After all, when she moved to another party and contested, how many vote did she get? She got only 16,000 plus. “But APC got over 340,000 votes. So, her movement has not shaken APC in Taraba State. It is in the heart of Tarabans that they want APC and they will continue to support APC.” Shedding light on his visit you the CENCPC, El-Sudi said they were there to interact with the leadership adding that very soon they will begin to register new members, as well as the national secretariat, gives them the green light. “We talked of the membership drive. We have no power to register people unless we have directives from the National Secretariat, the federal presence in the state, and projects like roads from Numan to Jalingo and to expedite action of complete the Mambilla hydroelectric power project as well as the problem of Ebib Bridge.”
