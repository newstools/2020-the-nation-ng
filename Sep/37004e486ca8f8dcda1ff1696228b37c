Nigeria international Victor Osimhen has been lauded as a 30-goal striker by Diego Armando Maradona Junior. Junior, who was born in Naples, Italy and nurtured in the SSC Napoli academy, is the son of Argentine football icon Diego Maradona. The 33-year-olda midfieldera-cum-forward believes new Napoli signing Osimhen will excel in the Italian Serie A with the striker having netted two hat-tricks in pre-season. Maradona, who represented Italy at the 2008 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup, has highlighted Osimhen’s qualities. “He is a forward with a great prospect, he has hallucinating room for improvement. If put in the right conditions, he can become a 30 goal striker. He’s just 21,” Maradona told Gonfialarete. “I have expressed some doubts about his construction phase when it comes to tying up the game. “He doesn’t have to do it too much, it doesn’t have to be his first goal. He is good at attacking depth and if he has space in front it hurts,” he added. Napoli will start their 2020/21 Serie A campaign against Parma at the Stadio Ennio Tardini on September 20.
