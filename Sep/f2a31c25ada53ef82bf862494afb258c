A group, George Uboh Whistleblowers Network, yesterday asked Governor Godwin Obaseki to render the account of his stewardship. It issued an ultimatum to him to reply to the allegations on how he ran the state in the last three and a half years. The body, which raised allegations on public spending by the governor, said rendering account is in the spirit of electioneering period. In a letter to the governor dated September 14 and signed by its chairman, George Uboh, the group said if it had requested the anti-graft body and number two citizen of the country to tender their stewardship, Obaseki should promptly respond to its call.  According to the group, Obaseki should shed light on the financial transactions by his government, including payments for contracts, salaries, Value Added Tax and transfers running to billions of Naira. The group said explanations would be needed for alleged transfers to banks, ministries, departments and agencies, contractors. Uboh said: “Although we found suspicious transactions in multiple years, however, the suspicious transactions became rampant and egregious in 2019, hence, our conclusion that Obaseki needs to explain whether or not he misused funds in preparation for the election.”
