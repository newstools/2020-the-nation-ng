After the departure of Philippe Coutinho, Alvaro Odriozola is the next one to leave Bayern Munich.
The club confirmed on Thursday that the defender has returned to Real Madrid following the end of his loan spell. A right-back was requested by coach Hansi Flick during the mid-season break. Odriozola was recruited but made only five appearances for the German club – three in the Bundesliga, one in the German Cup, and another one in the UEFA Champions League. “I will like to thank Alvaro. As a team, we became German champions, German Cup winners and UEFA Champions League winners with all of our players, and Alvaro also had his part in the success,” board member for sport Hasan Salihamidzic said in a club statement. On Tuesday, Bayern Munich had announced the departure of Coutinho, who returned to FC Barcelona. Now the club is set to make a decision regarding the future of Ivan Perisic, who was on loan from Inter Milan.  (dpa/NAN)
