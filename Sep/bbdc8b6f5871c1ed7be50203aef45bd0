Rangers coach Steven Gerrard  is optimistic  the club’s  medical team would get injured Nigeria’s Leon Balogun back   on his feet. Balogun didn’t even make the kick-off after a muscle problem flared during the warm-up  in the 4-0 win at home against Dundee United. Both Ryan Jack and Brandon Barker also  went down inside the opening 20 minutes with calf and hamstring injuries, respectively. But Gerrard is hopeful Balogun and Morelos will be fit to face Lincoln Red Imps in Thursday’s opening Europa League qualifier. “It’s something that we will certainly look into but in terms of preparation and trusting how my staff goes about things this is the first time we have had a day like this when things have gone against us,” he said. “I don’t think we can do anything about Alfredo’s injury. It’s an impact injury. We think Leon Balogun will be fine. We think we got it before it was an injury, it was a bit of tightness and we made the right decision to take him out of the team.” Rangers broke Celtic’s 114-year clean sheet record as they became the first Scottish side to ever kick-off a campaign with seven straight shut-outs.
