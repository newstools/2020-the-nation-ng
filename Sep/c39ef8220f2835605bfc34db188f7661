Kelechi Nwakali’s stunted career seems to be back on track after problems with red-tape and a lack of playing time while on loan from English side Arsenal to Portuguese club Porto left him very low on confidence. The 22-year-old was a 63rd  minute substitute in newly-promoted Huesca’s 1-1 draw at Villarreal on Sunday as the new La Liga season kicked off and the 2015 Under-17 World Cup MVP said he felt bad when things were not going according to plan, especially seeing his Golden Eaglets teammates Victor Osimhen and Samuel Chukwueze’s careers flourish. He secured a move to Spanish side Huesca in August last year from Arsenal but was forced to sit-out the first six month of his contract in Nigeria trying to secure the documentation that he needed to travel to Spain. “I felt bad that things are not moving the way I want them to and the way I have planned, but not because I was seeing my colleagues doing well,” Nwakali told BBC. “I still speak to Victor and Samuel Chukwueze, I always call to check in on them, even though it is not working the way I want but it’s life, I believe in time, and if it’s not time for me, it is not going to happen. “I have come to understand that people just want to be where it is moving fast and well, but life is about ups and downs, sometimes we just have to bring back our human feelings and support each other when things aren’t going well.”
