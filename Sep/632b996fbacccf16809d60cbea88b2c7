 LAST week, Kwara State Commissioner for Special Duties, Hajia Aisha Ahman Pategi, resigned and said she was moving to endeavours outside government and politics. “Life is in process, and I am bold to say that having journeyed the political terrain, now is the time for me to leave and focus on new ideas,” she said citing personal reasons for her sudden exit from government. But Sentry gathered there was more to the unexpected parting of ways between Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq and Pategi, who, at the inception of the administration, served as Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs. She was redeployed to the Ministry of Special Duties in a minor cabinet reshuffle following a widely reported face-off between her and the Commissioner for Finance, Olasumbo Oyeyemi, over control of local government finances. Sources within and outside the government say Pategi’s resignation may not be unconnected with the report of a fact-finding panel constituted by the governor to look into the disagreement between the two commissioners. The panel, headed by Justice Mathew Adewara, is expected to turn in its report any moment from now. Sentry gathered that Pategi, whose claim that N300 million was diverted from the state’s local government fund, may not have been backed by the panel’s report. “It appears she is aware of this. I can tell you that her decision to quit the government is a move to preempt the possible decision of the governor, who is said to be very displeased with her at the moment,” a source claimed. In spite of her hurried resignation, Sentry learnt the panel will still go ahead and present its report to AbdulRazaq.
