MTN Nigeria said it is willing to collaborate with cloud technology service providers to provide support for small business enterprises as part of its response to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy. Its Chief Enterprise Business Officer, Lynda Saint-Nwafor, who  spoke to SME business owners at The Revv Programme masterclass themed “Setting Up Your Business for Success: The Technology Advantage”, said SMEs are the bedrock of the economy. She said: “We have the interest of SMEs at heart and whilst we do not provide all the services that are applicable, we are willing to partner with organisations that provide access to technology tools that are relevant to SMEs on a platform that makes it is easy for them to access at the right price.” She stressed the need for stakeholders to align and find ways to close the gaps that exist for SMEs and “assist them in this transformational journey from being digital migrants to becoming digital natives”. According to Lynda, this is what MTN is trying to achieve. The Revv Programme is an initiative from MTN Nigeria to aid small businesses rethink and relearn their operations to enable them mitigate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic using a four-pronged approach that includes masterclasses, access to market, productivity tools support and advisory initiatives.
