Justice Maurice Eneji’s tenure as the acting Chief Judge of the state expired on September 2.  Justice Eneji cannot be reappointed having served for two conservative tenures of three months each. The National Judicial Council (NJC) headed by the Chief Justice of the Federation (CJN) was yet to act on the situation in Cross River State judiciary. Speaking in a telephone interview, the Chairman of Calabar branch of the NBA, Dr. Paul O. Ebiala, regretted the non-appointment of a substantive State Chief Judge He said the absence of the Chief Judge of the State portends danger and not a healthy development for the state. The lawyer said it was unprecedented in the history of the Judiciary in Cross River State to be without a Chief Judge “The absence of the Judiciary in Cross River State is like shutting down the system completely, it is just like having a state but no governor. “A state that has no governor is shut down completely; the Judiciary that has no Chief Judge is also shut down completely. A similar thing applies to the House of Assembly. “In the case of the Speaker of the House of Assembly, we have a Deputy Speaker and we also have a deputy governor but in the case of Chief Judge, there is no deputy.”
