 Bishop Stephen Mamza, Chairman, Christians Association Nigeria (CAN), Adamawa State Chapter, has been certified free of the COVID-19 virus. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the cleric tested positive for COVID-19 on August 23. Mamza, who is a member of the Adamawa State COVID-19 Committee, confirmed the development while speaking with newsmen on Saturday in Yola. “I want to use this opportunity to inform the general public that I have been certified free of the Coronavirus. “Also, I want to sincerely thank all people of goodwill who prayed for me to get well. “I want to assure everybody that I am now physically well,” Manza said. He said Coronavirus is real and urged Nigerians to take necessary precautionary measures, especially by complying with the COVID-19 protocols. The Cleric noted that the effect of COVID-19 had been misunderstood or exaggerated, thereby instilling fear in people about the disease. “Coronavirus is not a death sentence and it is not probably as bad as being exaggerated because you can be infected and be treated. “The fear of the disease cripples some people. People should not panic and be afraid of the disease if they obey prevention protocols,” Mamza added. When asked where and how he was infected with the virus, Manza said that he always used face mask when going out and adhered to the protocols. “I am a human being. Since others can contract the virus, I am also prone to it,” he said. “I feel that God decided to use me to educate people about the reality of the disease. “I take it in good faith. It was something meant to educate people.”  NAN)
