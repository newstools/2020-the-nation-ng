Suspected cultists have caused chaos in Diobu waterfront communities, Port Harcourt Rivers State, shooting into the air, and damaging properties including vehicles. It was gathered that the nefarious activities of the hoodlums created panic among residents forcing most of them to hide in their houses. Sources said the waterfront communities of Obidianso, Nwachukwu, Anozie, Echue, Ukwato, Timber and Okwelle, were thrown into confusion by the rampaging youths. The Diobu Vigilante reportedly nabbed one of the suspects, identified as Brown, recovered an AK 47 rifle from the area, and handed over to the Eagle Crack unit of the police attached to Mile one Police Division. The Chairman of Diobu Vigilante, Amatari Bipelede, who confirmed the incident, said his group apprehended one of the suspects and handed him over to the police.
