A high ranking member of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) Mohammed Misau has joined the All Progressive Congress (APC) in Bauchi. Misau, who represented Bauchi Central, is an ally of the immediate past Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon Yakubu Dogara. He announced his defection to the APC after a visit to the APC Caretaker Chairman and Yobe Governor, MaiMala Buni on Friday. The Nation reports the former senator is one of the aggrieved PDP chieftains in Bauchi. His defection is not unconnected with the fall-out between Governor Bala Mohammed and Dogara who the latter accused of running a one-man show. Misua regretted the contributions he made to the PDP that led to it winning the gubernatorial election have been thrown to the wind to the extent that some party chieftains have been relegated to the background. Misau who confirmed his defection in a phone interview with The Nation said: ” The way the Governor (Bala Mohammed) is handling the State, there is no way we will just be watching. After all, we have promised our people that there would be a change. That we would be better than previous governments but all of a sudden; it is even worse than the last administration”. “I have been having a series of meetings and this (defection) just took place now in not more than 30 minutes ago. I have joined my brother, Yakubu Dogara.” Misau was supervisor at the PDP State Congress held in Niger two weeks ago. Misau was also a Chairman of the recovery panel set up by Governor Mohammed.
