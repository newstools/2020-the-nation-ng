Kiddwaya has said he won’t have any regret if he eventually gets evicted on Sunday. He said being in the House for eight weeks is already a blessing for him, adding that he has achieved a lot with his stay. He said this during a discussion with Laycon on Thursday. “If I make it past the Sunday eviction or not, either way, I will be okay. “There is so much to be thankful for and I will be equally grateful that I got this far. “I keep telling everyone that whether you stay till the end, you have to be proud of yourself for coming this far. “I feel like I have achieved a lot just by being in this house and staying this long,” he said.
