Nigeria international Francis Uzoho has taken a giant step towards recovery from injury after completing his first training session with his Apoel FC teammates since joining the Cyprus club two months ago. The Super Eagles goalkeeper suffered a ligament injury during his country’s international friendly outing against five-time world champions Brazil in Singapore back in October 2019. The Nigerian has been taking part in individual workout since arriving at the Cypriot outfit on a three-year deal from Spanish second division club Deportivo La Coruna. Apoel uploaded a picture of the Nigeria in a group picture with his teammates on the club’s verified Instagram page with a caption, “Winners in a “controversial“tournament.” The 21-year-old has missed Apoel’s two opening games of the 2020/2021 Cypriot First Division, a 2-2 draw with Karmiotissa and 3-0 loss to AEK Larnaca. He was also not available for the team’s 2-0 victory away to Gjilani in the UEFA Europa League. The latest development will no doubt be cheering news to Super Eagles’ Technical Adviser/Chief Coach Gernot Rohr, who will soon name his squad for the double-header international friendly against the Elephants of Cote d’Ivoire and the Carthage Eagles of Tunisia billed to hold on October 9 and 13 respectively in Austria.
