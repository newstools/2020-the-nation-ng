Operatives of the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) have arrested two phone technicians alleged to have lured victims with cheap prices for expensive mobile phones on jiji.com. The suspects, Chukwuemeka Ogbonna, 45, and Olabode Kehinde, 34, police said, usually lured their buyers to places where they took  their money and gave them fake mobile phones. They were arrested separately on Wednesday at Olowu Street, Ikeja. It was gathered that the duo worked for the same syndicate and had advertised an Iphone X, a phone valued at N240,000 for N155,000 to lure buyers. The suspects said they also sold fake mobile phones at Computer Village. “Times are hard. I need money to feed my family. We are many doing it. We call it street hustling. I wont go back to it if released,” he stated. Commissioner of Police Hakeem Odumosu urged residents to be wary of criminals masquerading as phone dealers whose aim is to defraud them of their hard earned money.
