Two-time Head of House,Ozo, has revealed he feared he was going to be evicted before Kiddwaya. He said this during a conversation with Neo. Ozo, who already has two strikes, said all Housemates thought he was going home on the eighth Sunday live eviction show but he was surprised when Kiddwaya left instead. He however promised to change and tread carefully in the House so he doesn’t get a third strike which is an automatic disqualification. “Kiddwaya’s eviction before me gave me a hard reset despite my week of infringement and strike. “Now I’ve decided to be focused for these two weeks and stay on my lane.” Prince and Kiddwaya’s journey ended on Sunday, September 13, after eight weeks – a total of 56 days – in the house.
