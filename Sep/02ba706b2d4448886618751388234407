 A TEENAGER has been shot dead by suspected cultists in Aba, the commercial nerve of Abia State. According to reports, the incident, which happened not far away from the late victim’s family residence, caused pandemonium in the area as people took to their heels. A source said the victim was suspected to be a member of one of the street cult groups. A police source who confirmed the incident, added, though, that there was no official report yet on the incident. “Leaving your children at home for work or business now is a huge risk because they are at home with these bad boys,” said a resident. “Some of them who refused to join them are either intimidated by the street cult boys. “The increase in the number of crime such as rape, armed robbery, snatching of phones and handbags in this area cannot be associated only to intake of hard drugs, but the activities of these hoodlums who go about with various dangerous weapons which they used in dispossesing innocent members of the public of their valuables.”
