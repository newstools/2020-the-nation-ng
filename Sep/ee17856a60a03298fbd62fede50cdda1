I feel like social media has been filled with so much happiness and positive vibes and good energy that you see robots on social media, it is not like people are not going through a lot in their lives, just that, that part of your life is not entertaining, so you don’t see what is going on in the background and it can be very tough if you are going through a lot of things and then it looks like everybody else is just living their best life like people have stuff they are going through as well just that for the main fact that social media is supposed to be an entertaining platform nobody is going to share that part with you”, she said. Over the weekend, Maraji became a trending topic on the Nigerian social media scene after she revealed that she suffered a heartbreak. Maraji explained how her longtime boyfriend ended their relationship abruptly after two years of courtship.
