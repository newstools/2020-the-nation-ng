The Rivers State House of Assembly has approved another N6.5 billion loan for the state. The money, the lawmakers said, would be used to improve agriculture by providing farmers with loans for improved food production for security, as well as to service and renovate educational facilities. This is coming one month after the lawmakers granted Governor Nyesom Wike’s earlier request to borrow N18 billion for flyover, road construction and dualisation of some roads in Port Harcourt, the state capital. Wike said the loan would be repaid through the Internally Generated Revenue (IGR). All the 22 members present voted in favour of the loan.
