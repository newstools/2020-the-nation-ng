Security at the venue however restored normalcy counting continued. Speaking after announcing the result, Chairman of the Coalition 2020 and former Senior Special Assistant on Political Matters to former Governor Olusegun Mimiko, Mr. Akin Akinbobola, said any party that win the mock election would win the October 10 governorship polls. Akinbobola announced adoption of APC and Governor Akeredolu as the candidate and party the Coalition would support and vote for in the governorship election. He said members of the Coalition 2020 changed their mind about their quest to stop Akeredolu’s second term bid after meeting and listening to him. His words, “The outcome is a reflection of the thinking of Ondo State people. There must be complaints but majority of the people have spoken “This Coalition has adopted the APC as our party that we will support. We will work to ensure APC candidate emerge winner of the October 10 governorship election.” State Chairman of the APC, Engr. Ade Adetimehin, said it was the first time a Coalition of various groups and political parties would be adopting a single candidate. Engr. Adetimehin urged losers to embrace peace and denied bribing delegates to vote for the APC.
