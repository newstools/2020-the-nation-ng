Tottenham has signed highly-rated left-back Sergio Reguilon, with Jose Mourinho securing a deal worth a reported £28 million ($36m) amid rival interest from Manchester United. The Red Devils had been in discussions with the full-back but never reached the stage of making an official bid as they refused to entertain Madrid’s request of including a buy-back clause. The 23-year-old defender saw his stock rise considerably during the 2019-20 campaign as, having been restricted to just 22 competitive outings for Madrid, the decision was taken for him to spend a season on loan at Sevilla. He quickly nailed down a regular role in their plans, becoming a full Spain international and Europa League winner along the way. A collection of consistent and eye-catching performances saw Reguilon emerge as a top target for leading sides across the continent. Sevilla had hoped that another agreement could be reached with La Liga rivals Real that allowed them to keep an emerging talent on their books. Admiring glances were also shot in Reguilon’s direction from Old Trafford, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer looking to bolster his ranks in Manchester. United have, however, decided against pursuing a deal and will see a domestic foe benefit from the ability of a buccaneering full-back in 2020-21. Spurs have already invested heavily in Matt Doherty during the current transfer window, with the Republic of Ireland international snapped up from Wolves. He is being slotted in on the right of Mourinho’s defensive unit, with Reguilon now set to provide another fresh face on the left. It could be that he forms a productive partnership with Gareth Bale down that flank, with Tottenham closing in on a second agreement with Real that will see them return a familiar face to north London in an initial season-long loan.
