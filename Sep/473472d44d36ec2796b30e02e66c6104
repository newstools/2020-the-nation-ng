Ekiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi has commiserated with former governor Ayodele Fayose on the death of his elder sister, Mrs. Mojisola Ladeji. Dr. Fayemi, in a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Yinka Oyebode, said he received the news of Mrs. Ladeji’s death with shock, as he was aware that the deceased was hale and hearty before the news of her untimely death was broken. The governor described the deceased as a sister, having shared the bond of attending the same secondary school, Christ’s School, Ado-Ekiti. He said the death of Mrs. Ladeji was a loss not only to the ex-governor, but also to him and the Christ’s School family. While noting that the loss of a beloved sister could be devastating, Dr. Fayemi urged Fayose to seek solace in the fact that the deceased lived an impactful life. He prayed God to grant the bereaved family the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss.
