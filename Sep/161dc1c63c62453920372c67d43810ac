Ondo State Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has lambasted his predecessor, Dr. Olusegun Mimiko and the candidate of the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP), Agboola Ajayi. Akeredolu, the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), who spoke yesterday in a television interview monitored by our reporter, said there were some people who were never qualified to be governor of Ondo State. He said the combination of Mimiko and Agboola as third force does not make him nervous. Governor Akeredolu said his achievements in his first term would give him victory at the polls.
