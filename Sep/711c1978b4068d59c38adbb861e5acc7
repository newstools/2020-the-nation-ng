The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ondo has raised the alarm over the alleged massive purchase of Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) from commercial motorcycle riders and traders at the Ondo Government House. It however urged the riders and traders to collect the money as it belongs to them but use their PVCs to vote out Governor Akeredolu and the APC. A spokesman for the Ondo PDP, Kennedy Peretei, in a statement, reminded the motorcycle operators that selling their PVCs would further impoverish and deny them their social responsibility. Peretei urged them and others allegedly enticed to submit their PVCs for financial inducement to be vigilant and use their votes to advance development in the state. According to him: “The PDP believes that such financial inducement in exchange for their PVCs is illegal. We cannot discourage them from collecting the money as it is ‘their money.’ “Such monies ordinarily should be used for the development of the State but the failed government felt that using it for financial inducement is the best thing to do at this time. “We appeal to the people who are being enticed with this Greek gift to collect it willingly and use their PVCs genuinely to send out the APC led the government from Alagbaka on October 10.” But a spokesman for Ondo APC, Alex Kalejaiye, said the party does not need to collect PVCs before winning the governorship election. Kalejaiye urged the PDP to withdraw from the race before it leads its unsuspecting supporters on an endless ego trip. “From all indications, the coast is clearer for our victory beyond the imagination of these pretenders. First, they thought our party would implode after primary; nothing happened. “All stakeholders are now together and united for Aketi. The cry is as a result of their defeated hopes, dashed expectations, and almost truncated desires.”
