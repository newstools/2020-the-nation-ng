 THE Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) said on Sunday it impounded 8,345 commercial buses for non-adherence to safety protocols against the spread of COVID-19 in Anambra. The Sector Commander, Mr. Andrew Kumapayi, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Awka that about 962 rickety trucks were also impounded between January and August. He said the arrests were made during the joint operations of the FRSC and the Anambra State Ministry of Transport. Following the lifting of the ban on interstate travels by the Federal Government, commercial transport operators were urged to adhere strictly to COVID-19 safety protocols to curb the spread of the disease.
