Over 5,000 card readers belonging to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) have been razed in an inferno that consumed Akure office of the commission. The fire was still raging as at the time of filing the report but fire fighters were making attempts to put it out. A top INEC official, who pleaded anonymity, said the fire razed the section where card readers were kept. He attributed the cause to electrical surge as the card readers were always charged inside the place. Another staff said the fire started at about 8:13pm and affected the ICT unit of the INEC.  The firemen that came were helpless as they claimed not to have water. INEC Commissioner in charge of Information and Voters Education, Festus Okoye, who spoke at the scene of the incident, said the fire affected the ICT section of the office. Okoye said over 5,100 card readers were burnt, including the 1,000 card readers delivered to Ondo INEC from Osun State. Fire service men from Akure Airport arrived at exactly 9:14pm and started helping to put out the fire.
