Jigawa chairman of the All Progressive Congress (APC) Alhaji Habibu Sara has been suspended indefinitely. Sara was suspended after a marathon caucus meeting at Dutse Government House. Sara accepted his suspension in good faith. He told The Nation on phone: “It is an act of God Almighty. All is part of politics and one day one will leave the world, talk less of any position”. He promised to remain a loyal party member and vowed to do everything with the law to promote and maintain the progress and popularity of the APC. The party did not give the reason for the decision to suspend the chairman but a source said it was in connection with the 2023 general elections. APC Secretary Muhd Umar was asked to take over the party affairs pending announcement of the next lines of action. Sara has been acting chairman since 2018 when former occupant chairman Hon Ado Sani Kiri resigned to contest for the Ringim/Taura Federal Constituency during the 2019/general elections.
