 Ondo State Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has promised to focus more on rural transformation in his second term. He said his first tenure had delivered landmark projects that touched all sectors of the economy. Akeredolu, speaking at the All Progressives Congress (APC) campaign in Ondo East Local Government, said he would open up rural communities under the World Bank Rural Access and Agricultural Marketing Project (RAAMP). He added that he had paid the counterpart funding. He assured farmers that the intervention would enable them get their produce to the markets as well as encourage youths to become agropreneurs.  Akeredolu said: “We promised that we would construct road. We have constructed it. It’s still ongoing. In our second term, we will use RAAMP to build a lot of rural roads.” “When we came on board, there was no employment for the people. But within three and a half years, we have employed over 400 graduates at the Ondo State Internal Revenue Service. We have employed over 500 doctors; we are also employing 2,000 teachers. We have constructed schools and built roads.” The governor urged the people to re-elect him to enable him consolidate his achievements. The Oloja in Ondo East hailed Akeredolu for fulfilling the promises he made during his 2016 campaign. Oloja of Mobiye High Chief Felix Kolawole pledged 100 per cent votes for the APC in the locality.
