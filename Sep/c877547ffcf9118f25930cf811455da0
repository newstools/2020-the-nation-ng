The Olugbode Royal Family in Ibadan has claimed that with over 300 households of descendants of Owu progenitors, the ancient city of Ibadan is hosting more of the ancient warrior great-grandchildren than Abeokuta, the capital of Ogun State. Mogaji Teslim Olugbode, the head of the Olugbode Family in Ibadan, spoke on Thursday when the family visited the Oyo State Commissioner for Information, Culture and Tourism, Dr. Wasiu Olatubosun, in Ibadan. Teslim said the visit was to keep the state government abreast of the preparation of the descendants of Owu, under the umbrella of the ‘Royal Union of Owu People in Ibadan’, to host the first ‘Owu Day’ in Ibadan, Oyo State, where former President Olusegun Obasanjo and Governor Seyi Makinde would be among the dignitaries. He said the Owu people in Abeokuta moved from Ibadan after the old superiority war in the then Yoruba kingdom, adding that Owu people spread all over the country and abroad since then. He said the first Owu Day in Ibadan will hold on October 31.
