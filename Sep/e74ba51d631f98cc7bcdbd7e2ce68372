 THIAGO Alcantara has revealed that the ‘family’ feel around Liverpool was a key factor in his decision to join the club. The 29-year-old has called time on a lengthy and successful stay at Bayern Munich in order to join up with the Premier League champions this summer. Hansi Flick was keen to keep hold of a player who played a key role in a Champions League success secured with victory over Paris Saint-Germain only last month. But Thiago has explained that a desire to pick up new silverware and the positive environment offered at Melwood were behind his desire to move on. “I think it’s an amazing feeling. I was waiting for this moment for a long time and I am very, very happy to be here,” he told the club’s official website. “When the years are passing, you are trying to win as much as you can – and when you win, you want to win more. I think this club describes what I am as well; I want to achieve all of the goals, win as many trophies as possible.
