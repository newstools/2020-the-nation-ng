Prof. Idia Ize-Iyamu, the wife of the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate, has said her husband, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, has plans to establish a special victims unit to combat sexual assault and care for survivors of rape and other gender-based violence. Speaking on Thursday while featuring on a popular morning show, ‘Your View’, on Television Continental, the professor of orthodontist, who recently launched a free medical outreach across the three senatorial districts to provide access to quality health care for the residents, said her husband would prioritise the care and empowerment of vulnerable groups. Describing herself as an empowered woman, Prof. Ize-Iyamu praised her husband as a compassionate man, who is a strong believer in the capacity of women to inspire change in the society and contribute to growth and development when provided with an enabling environment and offered the right support. She said Ize-Iyamu had plans to offer similar support and empowerment to Edo women in their chosen endeavours if he emerged as the governor.
