Evicted Ozo has explained his relationship with two of the last five Housemates, Dorathy and Nengi. Ozo said while Dorathy was his favourite person in the House, he couldn’t stop being attracted to Nengi. The 28-year-old sports business player said: “I always said from day one that Dora was my favourite person and I was more attracted to Nengi and it is what it is.” Ozo’s love triangle with the two finalists caused a backlash on social media while he was in the House. On Sunday, September 20, Ozo was evicted from the show alongside TrikyTee. After spending 63 days in the House, Ozo joins other evicted Housemates like Kiddwaya, Lucy, Wathoni, TolaniBaj, BrightO, Praise, Kaisha, Tochi, Eric, Ka3na and Lilo. Ozo holds the bragging right to being the first Lockdown Housemate to emerge the Head of House twice – in the third and sixth weeks. On the same table include Erica and Nengi, who also emerged the Head of House twice. Erica was disqualified from the game for misconduct while Nengi was the first to secure a place in the finale.
