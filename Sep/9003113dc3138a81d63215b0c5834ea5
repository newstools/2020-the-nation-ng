A former member of the House of Representatives, Abimbola Daramola, has revealed that many entrepreneurs fail in businesses as a result of various reasons that are often neglected. Daramola attributed the failure of entrepreneurship to lack of sufficient knowledge and skills by entrepreneurs. The ex-lawmaker who spoke yesterday in Abuja while addressing potential entrepreneurs, called on governments to institutionalise entrepreneurship by setting up well-equipped training centers across the country where Nigerians can learn various skills. The All Progressives Congress (APC) Chieftain, who recently launched a scheme called project 60:60:60 to mark the country’s 60 year anniversary,  hinted that after the training, successive entrepreneurs would be given grants from N60,000 to N1 million to shore up their businesses. He however called on government to come up with measures to save the loss of jobs especially in the face of the novel COVID-19. He said, “For instance, in Nigeria today, 39.4 million people are jobless. Just yesterday, 40 per cent of work staff of Hilton got downsized. Where did they go? That figure has not been captured. And this has been made worst by COVID-19. In going forward, there is a comparative need that entrepreneurship is the way to go.” “The assumption has always been that everyone could be an entrepreneur, but it is not right. The place or capacity to use the resources that you have been given is also very critical to the success and value of the money that you have been given. “We cannot raise entrepreneurs on the basis of two days training or one day training. It must be structurally backed.” He added: “We are trying to raise 60 entrepreneurs from the six geopolitical zones. We feel that we can take entries from cross the length and breadth of the country, and select the best 60 from each of them. “And then send them into the boot camp where they will be giving the appropriate and requisite training to be able succeed in the market place.
