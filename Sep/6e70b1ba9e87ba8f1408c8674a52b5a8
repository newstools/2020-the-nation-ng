Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide, has advised the Nigerian Army to shun any plan to declare state of emergency in the  South East. The group in statement by the National President, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro and the Secretary General,  Mazi Okwu Nnabuike the group said: “The recent proclamations of Nigerian military that any more evidence of killings of security agents by Biafra agitators in the Southeast region could lead to declaration of State of Emergency is an affront on the people of the region and a calculated attempt to create confusion and tension in the zone in as much  as we are not in support of any killings of Igbos and security agents in South East.  We had urged the military to concentrate on tackling the insecurity challenges in the Northern region where bandits and terrorist organisations like Boko Haram insurgents had wreaked havoc and fear amongst the people.  We urge Nigerian Army to declare State of Emergency in the North East before thinking of Southeast. Igbo youths wish to categorically advise Biafra agitators to maintain  their original nonviolence postures and avoid making inflammatory threats of killings security agents in reprisal attacks. Such decision will surely bring catastrophic consequences to the peaceful atmospheric environment we enjoy in the Southeast.
