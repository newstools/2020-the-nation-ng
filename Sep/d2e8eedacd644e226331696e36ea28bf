 Honeywell Flour Mills Plc recorded considerable improvements in sales and profitability but equally increasing loans continued to undercut performance. Audited report and accounts of Honeywell Flour Mills for the year ended March 31, 2020 showed improved actual and underlying profitability, driven by sales growth and operating efficiency. With the leap in net earnings, the flour-milling company returned to dividend payment, after skipping payout in the previous year.

Governance and structures Honeywell Flour Mills Group consists of Honeywell Flour Mills Plc, the parent company and its wholly-owned subsidiary- Honeywell Superfine Foods Limited. A member of the Honeywell Group, a Nigerian conglomerate with widely diversified interests in manufacturing, oil and gas and financial services sectors, Honeywell Flour Mills became a public limited liability company in 2008 and its shares were quoted on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) in 2009. It currently has some 32,719 shareholders. Two shareholders accounted for 80 per cent equity stake. Siloam Global Services Limited holds 75 per cent equity stake while First Bank of Nigeria holds five per cent equity stake. Dr. Oba Otudeko, who chairs the board of directors and his son, Obafemi Otudeko, a non executive director, hold the largest equity stakes through their interests in Siloam. Mr. Olanrewaju Jaiyeola still leads the executive management as managing director. The company complied generally with extant codes of corporate governance and best practices with appropriate board committees and management structures to ensure effective oversight and decision-making. Analyst’s opinion Honeywell Flour Mills operates in the strategic food manufacturing segment of the Nigerian manufacturing sector, a segment at the core of the government’s self sufficiency food programme. This presents several opportunities and challenges. Direct government intervention programmes have deepened access to finance and other incentives, but these are counterbalanced by adverse impact of poor infrastructure and declining consumer purchasing power. Competition is intense and inclusive, with companies moving from end-miller to production across the entire agribusiness value chain. Recent expansion, especially its ultramodern Sagamu factory, has enhanced the competitiveness of Honeywell Flour Mills. There is the need to reconsider the financing structure of the company, deleveraging to mitigate expenses and improve returns. Considering its net assets and average share pricing trend, there is obvious disconnect between the company and its shareholders. Having a shared outlook is important for appropriate pricing and successful equity capital raising. First quarter results for the period ended June 30, 2020 showed a major drop in profitability. While turnover rose by 39 per cent from N19 billion in 2019 to N26.4 billion in 2020, pre-tax profit dropped by 51 per cent from N135 million to N66 million. After taxes, the net profit for the three-month period declined by 58 per cent from N108 million to N45 million. Is this a temporary setback, giving the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, or a reversal? Notwithstanding, there is still reasonable basis to be optimistic about the future outlook of the company.
