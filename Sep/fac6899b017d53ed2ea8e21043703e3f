The burnt Etsu Musa Market in Bida, Niger State is being rebuilt, 30 months after it was razed. Over 600 shops were burnt down in a midnight fire which occurred in March 2018 destroying goods worth millions of naira. Laying the foundation of the reconstruction of the market at the weekend, a House of Representatives member representing Bida/Gbako/Katcha Federal Constituency, Saidu Musa Abdullahi said rebuilding the burnt market is a project under the Zonal Intervention Project for his constituency in 2020. He said, “The Etsu Musa Market project is one of the most important projects we have facilitated. This is because not only does it have a direct positive impact on the socio-economic lives of the people, but also for the fact that it will be a dream come true for shop owners whose businesses and sources of livelihood have been affected by the fire.” “Immediately we got this opportunity, we started thinking of how to enhance the socio-economic development of this environment. Aside from its economic advantage, we also have to look at the social importance of the market,” he said
