 ALL Progressives Congress (APC) in Edo State and Deputy Governor Philip Shaibu are engaged in a verbal war over alleged gunrunning plot, ahead of the September 19 election. APC, in an online statement by the Chairman of its Media Campaign Council, Prince John Mayaki, alleged that the gunrunning plot involved Shaibu and members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state, particularly in Akoko-Edo Local Government. Alerting security agencies, APC named the people allegedly involved in the plot to disrupt the election and muscle votes in Akoko-Edo Council. It alleged that the people were plotting to arm and deploy thugs from Rivers, Delta and Kogi states to rig the poll. APC alleged that guns had been supplied to the named persons for distribution to thugs, already waiting to be brought into Edo State. It urged security agencies to thwart the plot. Shaibu, reacting through his Senior Special Assistant on Media, Benjamin Atu, said the allegation is false.
