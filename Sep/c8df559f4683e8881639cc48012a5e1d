Four indigenes of Ibadan are among the 18 applicants for the post of vice chancellor of the University of Ibadan (UI). They are professors Aderemi Raji-Oyelade, Oluwabunmi Olapade-Olaopa, Kayode Adebowale and Kolapo Amzat. Their candidature is a boost to the campaign by the Central Council of Ibadan Indigenes (CCII) for an indigene to be appointed the next VC of the premier university. But it is unclear if the process will permit such sentiment to influence who succeeds the incumbent Prof. Abel Olayinka on December 1. The new vice chancellor, when elected, will assume office for a single term of five years. The applicants have been canvassing for votes from stakeholders in the university community. The remaining 14 are professors Babatunde Salako, Babatunde Adeleke, Razaq Rom-Kalilu, Hakeem Fawehimi, Raheem Lawal and Adeyinka  Aderinto. Others are professors Clement Kolawole, Olusegun Ademowo, Oladele Layiwola, Temitope Alonge, Anthony Kadoye Onifade, Ebenezer  Farombi, Femi Mimiko and H. A. Saliu. While Kayode Adebowale is the incumbent Deputy Vice Chancellor (DVC Administration), Adeyinka Aderinto is DVC (Academic). Olapade-Olaopa is the former provost, College of Medicine, while Raji-Oyelade is a former dean, Faculty of Arts of the institution. The candidates are scheduled for a debate tagged “The Voice of UI VC: Who is Next”, later this week. The debate will hold on Zoom.
