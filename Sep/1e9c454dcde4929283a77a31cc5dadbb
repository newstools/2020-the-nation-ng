Gunmen who abducted Chief Medical Director of the General Hospital, Idoani, Ondo State, Dr. Olufemi Adeogun, have demanded a ransom of N6m. It was learnt that the kidnappers earlier demanded N100m. A family source said the kidnappers called three times before the ransom was reduced. The source said they have been assured that the victims would be rescued unhurt but the families of other victims are finding it difficult to raise funds. Dr Adeogun was abducted on Monday evening alongside two other health workers. Driver of the vehicle they were travelling in was shot in the arm. Police spokesman, ASP Tee-Leo Ikoro, did not return calls to his cell phone. It was gathered that security operatives, hunters and Amotekun Corps are combing the forest to rescue the victims.
