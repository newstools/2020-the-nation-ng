The Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, has said his non-appearance at Justice Ayo Salami Panel of Inquiry probing the suspended Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu is based on constitutional consideration. Malami, in a statement by his media aide, Dr. Umar Jibrilu Gwandu, said his failure to appear before the panel as a witness is “purely constitutional and not based on any ulterior motive.” The statement reads in part: “In establishing propriety or otherwise of the presence of the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice whose responsibility is to hold constitutional order one must root same within the constitutional provisions. “The terms and wordings of invitation extended to the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice to Justice Ayo Panel of inquiry against Magu runs contrary to the Constitutional provisions. “The Office of the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice is by the provision of the Constitution and extant laws empowered to serve supervisory role. “In the case of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice has been discharging the role effectively.”
