A fraudster, Sylvester Ehiarinmian 43, who defrauded a United State based Nigerian lady Miss Mary Ope 40, who has a vision of setting up a business in Nigeria has been arrested by operatives of the Zone 2 monitoring unit. Parading the suspect Wednesday, the Assistant inspector general of police AIG Iliyasu said, the suspect made love advance to her despite being married with children and promise marrying her. Naively, the lady swung into Sylvester’s net and she was neatly defrauded. When the lid was blown out and her eyes opened she petitioned to AIG Iliyasu and his operatives swung into action and recovered four Sienna space buses, a Toyota Highlander SUV jeep, and landed properties, comprising a story building, an undeveloped plot of land in the Wasa area of Abuja. Yet to be recovered from the suspect is a Mikano Generating set, two duplexes in South Africa, the sum of 15,000 US Dollars he fraudulently obtained from her, to procure a visa for the victim’s sister, 10,000 US Dollars he proposed to purchase carpets for an office they both agreed to operate and #40m for the establishment of a medical laboratory. In his confession the suspect said, yes my name is Ope. I did not defraud him. Her name is in the documents except for the one I bought by myself. She is my girlfriend. We had a small misunderstanding and she boasted that she has powerful people who will deal with me. On my own, let us go to court, that is what I want. Police also recovered a bunch of keys of a storey building consisting of two-bedroom flats and two self-contained, one-bedroom flat with boy quarters in Apo Resettlement Abuja.
