 KWARA State government has announced a three-week virtual digital training for youths. Application begins today and ends September 14th. The training is part of the state ongoing efforts to drive innovation and give young people the skills of the future, it was gathered. The virtual training, which is the second phase of a programme billed to benefit 30,000 young people across the state in three years, targets 10,000 applicants over the next two months in batches, Chief Press Secretary to the Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, Rafiu Ajakaye has said. The government had earlier trained over 3,000 in April during the COVID-19 lockdown. “The training becomes more imperative owing to the rise in the unemployment rate and a dearth of required skills to survive in the 21st-century,” the statement quoted Anchor of the Kwara State Social Investment Programmes (KWASSIP) Muhammed Brimah saying.
