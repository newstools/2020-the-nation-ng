   Nengi has asked Ozo to stay away from her till they leave the House. This is following Ozo’s constant relationship talks with Nengi who has continuously turned down his proposal. During the Saturday night party, Nengi told Ozo to keep his distance, saying she doesn’t need his love. “Don’t love me I don’t need your stupid love oga leave me, love yourself first,” Nengi told Ozo as she walked away from him at the party. After ending her friendship with Ozo, Nengi went back to Ozo to apologise to him.
