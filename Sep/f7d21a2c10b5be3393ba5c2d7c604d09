Leaders of Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), faith-based organisations, among others in Benin City have organised a mega summit for the All Progressives Congress (APC). They said it was held to support the party’s governorship candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu. The event, chaired by Prof. Julius Ihonvbere, was attended by personalities. Ihonvbere said campaign was a season to reflect and focus on strategies for good governance. He urged the campaign council to work for APC’s success on September 19. Ex-House of Representatives member Rasaq Bello-Osagie described the campaign council as a ground-clearing for Ize-Iyamu, adding that the Governor Godwin Obaseki administration’s only programme was ‘memorandum of understanding’. He described Ize-Iyamu as a man of God with a vision. The APC standard-bearer listed the challenges of Edo State as securxity, education, lack of teachers, poor infrastructure and youth mass unemployment. Analysing Ize-Iyamu’s SIMPLE agenda, Bello-Osagie expressed dismay at the current government’s failure to create the 200,000 jobs it promised. He lamented that the Edo State Central Hospital, built by Comrade Adams Oshiomhole’s administration, had been privatised by Governor Obaseki. The step, he said, had nurtured an Edo apartheid system of treating only rich patients and abandoning the poor ones; while the old hospital had been abandoned and left in a dilapidated state with overgrown weeds. A Nollywood star and lawmaker at the Lagos State House of Assembly, Olusola Desmond Elliot, has urged people to vote for Ize-Iyamu on September 19. He spoke at an APC rally at Anegbette in Etsako Central Local Government. Elliot said Edo State will be better if the people vote en masse for Pastor Ize-Iyamu.
