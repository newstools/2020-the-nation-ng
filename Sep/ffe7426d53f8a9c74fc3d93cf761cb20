 LORIENT new signing Terem Moffi said  he cannot wait to come face-to-face with PSG superstars Neymar and Kylian Mbappe in Ligue 1. Lorient forked out eight million Euros to sign Moffi, 21, from Belgian club KV Kortrijk, a record transfer sale for the Belgians, and will play the French champions in December. The Belgian side paid 150,000 euros to the Lithuanian first division side FK Riteriai in January to secure the services of the 21-year-old on a three and a half years deal. Moffi scored five goals in nine league matches before football in Belgium was cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic. “I love the fact that I will get to play against the likes of Neymar and Mbappe,” Moffi told SCORENigeria. Moffi added that playing in the Ligue 1 is just a step to bigger dreams. “I am a young professional and Ligue 1 is a stepping stone to bigger leagues and clubs,” he said.
