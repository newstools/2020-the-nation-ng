His birthday, coming at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has taken many lives regardless of age and class strata. Ever since he was born, he has enjoyed unlimited grace and love from his creator, thriving and flourishing smoothly in all his endeavours. The billionaire businessman has transformed swiftly over the years despite all odds against him. For every disappointment, he took them in good faith and moved on to come out better and stronger. The Chairman of Caades Groups started off early in life and today, he sits on a spot on the list of wealthy youngsters in Nigeria. Despite losing out to represent the people of Bendel Federal Constituency at the lower arm of the National Assembly, he has never ceased to show his benevolent side by constantly putting smiles on the face of people around him. In fact, one thing that keeps him going is the fact that he has constantly invested heavily in those around him without the hope of getting anything in return. As part of his 40th birthday celebration, through his Chima Anyaso Foundation, the Ofuji Bendel gifted 40 women within his constituency, grinding machines with cash as business startups.

Despite heavy showers of rain, it could not stop his guests from getting to share in his pot full of joy by sharing their testimony about the celebrant.
