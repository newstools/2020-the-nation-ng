 THE novel coronavirus has killed no fewer than 971,677 people since the outbreak emerged in China late last year, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP at 1100 GMT yesterday. No fewer than 31.6 million cases of coronavirus have been registered. Of these, at least 21,641,500 are now considered recovered. The number of cases in Europe topped five million, with a total of 5,000,421 with 227,130 deaths. More than half of the cases were registered in Russia, followed by Spain, France and the United Kingdom (UK). Europe is the fourth hardest-hit region in the world behind Latin America on 8,870,807 cases and 327,821 fatalities, Asia with 7,467,107 cases and 128,442 deaths, and the United States and Canada with 7,043,878 cases for 210,087 deaths. The Middle East has recorded 1,840,080 cases with 42,933 fatalities while Africa has 1,423,382 cases and 34,332 deaths. The tallies, using data collected by AFP from national authorities and information from the World Health Organisation, probably reflect only a fraction of the actual number of infections. Many countries are testing only symptomatic or the most serious cases. On Tuesday, 5,916 new deaths and 309,117 new cases were recorded worldwide. Based on the latest reports, the countries with the most new deaths were India with 1,085 new deaths followed by United States with 838 and Brazil with 836. The United States is the worst-hit country with 200,818 deaths from 6,897,495 cases. At least 2,646,959 people have been declared recovered.
