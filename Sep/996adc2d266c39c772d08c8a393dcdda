 THE Federal and State governments should adopt effective pre-school resumption COVID-19 procedures to avoid a rise in the pandemic, the Alliance for the Survival of COVID-19 and Beyond (ASCAB) said on Tuesday in Lagos. The coalition, in a statement signed by its Chairman, Femi Falana (SAN), said the group was worried about plans by authorities to open the gates of tertiary institutions without adequate preventive measures put in place. Before opening the schools, ASCAB called for efforts to curb unmitigated viral spread in communities congregating in large crowds to eke out a living and returning to multigenerational homes. The group suggested a quick and 24-hour turnaround testing, with large numbers of contact tracers. ASCAB said: â€œTo attempt to reopen schools to some four million in higher education and some 10 million at lower levels in this condition is a disaster waiting to happen, to put it mildly, making our youths guinea pigs of the pandemic.
