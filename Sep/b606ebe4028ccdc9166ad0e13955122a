Several houses have been destroyed by flood in Asikolaye, Kaduna South Local Government Area of Kaduna State, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports. The flooding, which occurred after a downpour on Monday night, persisted until yesterday and has forced many residents out of their homes. Some of the residents said the flooding occurs once in two years. Aisha Mohammed, whose house was submerged, said she tried without success to salvage some of her property. She urged the government to offer her some assistance, while Ibrahim Shehu said he lost livestock and was forced to slaughter them.  He said though he got the warning of the flood by SEMA but had nowhere else to go. Executive Secretary Kaduna State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) Maimumatu Abubakar, who went around the town to assess the extent of damage, advised residents against building houses close to river banks. She said that there was no record of deaths or missing persons resulting from the flooding. “We are hoping the flood will subside before the end of the day.” Secretary, Red Cross Kaduna State Sunday Awulu, said nine persons were rescued, while several others refused to vacate for fear of their property being stolen.
