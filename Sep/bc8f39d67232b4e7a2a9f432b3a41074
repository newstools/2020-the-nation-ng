 GOVERNORSHIP candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Eyitayo Jegede has explained why he picked Gboluga Ikengboju as his running mate and not Deputy Governor Agboola Ajayi. Ajayi was the first runner up at the PDP primaries despite joining the party 30 days earlier. He later left the PDP and picked the ticket of the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP). Jegede said Ajayi’s ambition was to be governor and not deputy governor. He spoke in a television interview monitored in Akure. Jegede said he picked Ikengboju, a lawmaker representing Okitipupa/Irele Federal Constituency, out of a long list of nominees presented to him. He said Ajayi was part of the many decisions made by Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, which the PDP is campaigning against. “Ajayi chose not to be my deputy. His ambition is to be a governor under a political party. He left the APC, came to PDP. He was defeated in our primary election and went to the ZLP. “I took opinions from virtually everybody. People chose the person who became my running mate. When a choice is made, we must respect it. One should not allow one’s ambition to override the choice of the people. “All the policies we are fighting, the pains we want to end, are the products of Akeredolu and his deputy. He was in our party (as a member) for just six weeks. He is a very powerful person and humble, you cannot do away with that.”
