Evicted Lucy has revealed she once decided to quit the show when she was constantly having issues with other Housemates but Dorathy stopped her. Lucy said the only reason she stayed back was that she thought about the people voting for her and Dorathy spoke to her out of the plan. “At a point, I considered leaving. But I thought about the people voting to keep me in the house and how I could jeopardize my own chances. “Then Dorathy talked me through it. So I decided to stay since I felt I had a new friend,” she said. She also opened up on her outburst with disqualified Erica. Lucy noted that her clashes with Erica became constant when she became Head of House and her character changed.
