 THE debate by the Niger State House of Assembly to address the lopsidedness in political appointments in the state ended in a rowdy session on Wednesday. A heated argument was sparked when nine out of fifteen members of the Assembly opposed to the debate of the private member bill moved by Malik Madaki representing Bosso Constituency. The bill is for a Law to establish the Niger State Character Commission with the responsibility to promote, monitor and enforce compliance with principles of the proportional sharing of all bureaucratic, economic, media and political posts at all levels of government in the state. While moving the motion which is in its second reading, Bosso argued that the bill was passed into law during the 7th and 8th.
