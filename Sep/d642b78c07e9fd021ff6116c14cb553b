Ahead of Saturday’s governorship election in Edo State, the Conference of Nigeria Political Parties (CNPP) has advised the Federal Government to refrain from acts capable of killing Nigeria’s democracy. The political body also pleaded with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and security operatives to end vote buying. CNPP in a statement signed on Wednesday by its Secretary General, Chief Willy Ezugwu warned that: “acts of benevolence by the Federal Government in states during campaign periods have gone beyond coincidences to becoming a suspicious vote buying by proxy as is being witnessed in Edo State today.” Calling on the international community: “to seriously take note of the strategic death blows the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has continued to give Nigerian democracy since the historic election that brought the party into office in 2015. “The ordinary Nigerian electorate who believed in the change mantra of the APC voted the then opposition party into office, reasoning that the party, with the anti-corruption disposition of President Muhammadu Buhari, will leave up to its promise to do things differently. “The CNPP, therefore, calls on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and all security agencies to save Nigerian democracy by preventing all acts of vote buying before they occur. “If Nigeria must survive in 2023, it’s about time President Muhammadu Buhari prevailed on INEC to do what is right to save Nigerian democracy from desperate politicians who see elections as do or die. “No lover of Nigeria will stand while the APC and PDP continue to rape democracy in broad day light. “The judiciary has not lived up to the general expectations of Nigerians in deciding post-election disputes. However, most pre-elections matters have been dealt with fairly by the judicial arm of the government but more needs to be done in post-election matters to discourage electoral violence and vote buying”, the CNPP stated.
