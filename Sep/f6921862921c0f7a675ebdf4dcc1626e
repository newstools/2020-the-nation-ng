The National Public Relations Officer, College of Education Academic Staff Union (COEASU) , Dr. Ahmed Lawan Bazza, has said it will be dangerous to reopen  schools without adequate preparation and proper health facilities. He said: “COEASU is not averse to schools resumption but all the COVID-19 protocols especially the non-pharmaceuticals aspect as presented by the Presidential Taskforce should be implemented. “Any inadequate preparation in that regard could result to a spike, which may be catastrophic to an already stressed nation in terms of public health facilities. “The implementation of the NEEDS assessment in public tertiary institutions is also a key factor in addressing some of the issues.” Ahmed also said the government had not  attended to the demands of the union. The union has,  however, declared an industrial action calling on the Federal Government to attend to their demands. Some of the demands made by COEASU includes the implementation of Needs Assessment, renegotiation on the 2009 agreement with the government, review of the act establishing the colleges of education, state  government insensitivity to the plight of colleges of education in the states, autonomy to award degree also known as dual mode, review of outsource services and mainstreaming of our securities into government payroll, integration of our staff schools as components of colleges of education in Nigeria. On the resumption of college’s of education in line with the Federal Government’s directive to reopen schools, he said the union would be having a National Executive Council meeting to take a position on the issues of industrial concern.
