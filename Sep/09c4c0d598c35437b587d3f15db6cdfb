Jobberman, the single largest online training and job placement website, in a press conference yesterday, announced its plans to host Nigeria’s largest Virtual Career Fair, which will take place on Wednesday, September 30,  2020. As part of its #Champions campaign, 250 potential employers from various sectors including digital, agriculture and creative, and 10,000 highly qualified candidates will come together under one virtual roof for the event. The one-day event will be centred on how to navigate the increasingly competitive job space and provide the necessary tools to get hired, with one on one interviews between candidates and employers  and  CV preparation master classes. The online event is part of Jobberman’s mandate to use its soft skills training to place three million young Nigerians in dignified employment in the next five years.
