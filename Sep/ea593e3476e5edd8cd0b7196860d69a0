 Nigeria Aruna Quadri yesterday inspired TTC RhönSprudel Fulda-Maberzell to 3-2 home win against TTC Bremen in week two of the Table Tennis Bundesliga (TTBL). It was German international Ruwen Filus that started the campaign for TTC RhönSprudel Fulda-Maberzell against Kazakhstan’s Kirill Gerassimenko but the German failed to start well for the home team as he fell 1-3.  But  TTC’s youngest player Fan Bo Meng  restored hope as  ease off  Swedish world champion silver medalist Mathias Falck in an amazing 3-1 win. Thereafter, Quadri wasted no time to  dispatch Romanian Hunor Szöcs 3-0 (11-9, 11-9, 11-5) but TTC was pegged after German  Filus was beaten  by Falck 3-0 in the other match.  In the deciding doubles match, Quadri partnered Meng  to dismiss the pair of Szöcs and  Marcelo Aguirre3-0 (12-10, 12-10, 11-7) for  their first home victory this season. “I must credit the coach for the victory because nobody expected the line-up we put together today,” an excited Quadri told NationSport. “But it worked for us because Meng did the impossible with the win over Falck; this is a big win for him and the club because Falck is one of the toughest players in the league. “Our team is growing in confidence and I believe we can do more; I am very happy that I was able to show them what I am capable of today. I hope we can have more wins like this in subsequent league matches,” he added.
