 NASARAWA State Government on Wednesday began the disbursement of over N300m as part payment of gratuities to over 600 retired civil servants. Nasarawa State Pensions Bureau Director-General Abdullahi Oseze stated this while presenting cheques on Wednesday in Lafia to benefitting retirees to mark the beginning of the distribution. Oseze said the state had undertaken a census of all retirees in the state and their entitlements since the creation of the state to enable it to pay off their gratuities in phases including those who retired over ten years ago. “We are hopeful that as we have started paying gratuities to retirees in the state, we won’t stop until we can pay everyone. I appeal to all pensioners in the state to maintain calmness as the government is concerned about their welfare.” He called on retirees who were not shortlisted for the first phase of payment to be patient and wait for their turn within the availability of funds.
