There was protest on Thursday at Idanre town in Idanre Local Government Area of Ondo State, as residents trooped out to protest the killing of a young man identified as Taye, by suspected political opponents. Taye, a supporter of the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP), was reportedly killed on Wednesday night at Alade-Idanre by suspected thugs. Witnesses said protesters set bonfires on roads. A source, who preferred anonymity, said: “Taye was attacked and killed at Alade yesterday (Wednesday) around 9 pm. Those who led thugs to perpetrate the crime have escaped, but we have declared them wanted. “When has it become a crime to be a member of an opposition party in this state? These thugs killed the man because he simply wore the fez cap of the ZLP and was our main supporter in the community. “The body of Taye has been deposited at the General Hospital in Idanre. Police have begun investigation.” ZLP Chairman in Idanre Ademehintoye Claudus, who confirmed the killing, alleged that the killers were sponsored by chieftains of a major party in the area. He said: “Taye was killed because he was canvassing support for the ZLP, being a member of our party. “What happened has confirmed that they are calling for war in this election because they have been attacking us unchallenged. “In fact, the party has broken the peace accord reached at the palace of the monarch of Idanre with other parties ahead of the election. “We have appealed to our members and supporters to remain calm even in the face of this provocation and asked them not to take the law into their hands.” Police spokesman Teo-Leo Ikoro said there was political skirmish on Wednesday night at Idanre during which one person was killed. He described it as a mob action. “But a detachment of policemen has been sent to the town to maintain law and order. “Investigation has begun to arrest suspects.”
