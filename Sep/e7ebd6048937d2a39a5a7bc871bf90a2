The Federal Government said it has spent N30,540,563,571.09 donated funds to fight COVID-19 from 1st April to 30th July, 2020. A total of N36.3 billon was donated by Nigerians to the Federal Government under the CACOVID initiatives at the perk of the pandemic. While the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) coordinated and warehoused the collection, the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation (OAGF) managed and released the funds to government agencies to fight COVID-19. Recently, the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) and Connected Development (CODE) had requested from OAGF details of COVID-19 spending under the Freedom of Information Act (FOI). The OAGF responded to the request stating N30,540,563,571.09 was spent, “representing 84% of the N36.3 billon public funds and donations received to respond to COVID-19 between 1st April, 2020 and 31st July, 2020, leaving the balance of N5.9 billion.” The OAGF revealed: “The Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 spent N22 billion and 36 states spent N7 billion to support their COVID-19 initiatives; the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) spent N877 million for deployment of assets in support of COVID-19 operations; while the Nigeria Police spent N500 million on personal protective equipment.
