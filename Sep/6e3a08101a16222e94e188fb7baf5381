A high ranking member of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), and former Senator who represented Bauchi Central District Sen. Mohammed Hamma Misau, has left the party for the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Bauchi State. Misau, who is an ally of the immediate past Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon Yakubu Dogara, announced his defection back to the APC after his visit to the APC Caretaker Chairman and Yobe State Governor, MaiMala Buni, where he made his official declaration on Friday. The Nation reports that the former senator is one of the aggrieved chieftains in the PDP, who earlier said he would be leaving the party. His defection is not unconnected with the fall-out between Mohammed and Dogara after the latter defected to the APC and accused Governor Bala Mohammed of running a one-man show. The former Senator had regretted that the contributions made to the PDP that led it to win the gubernatorial election has been thrown to the wind to the extent that some party chieftains have been relegated to the background. Misau, who confirmed his defection in a phone interview to our correspondent, said ‘’ The way the governor (Bala Mohammed) is handling the state, there is no way we will just be watching. After all, we have promised our people that there would be a change. That we would be better than previous governments but all of a sudden; it is even worse than the last administration”. “I have been having a series of meetings and this (defection) just took place now in not more than 30 minutes ago. I have joined my brother, Yakubu Dogara.” He had only recently held a position as supervisor at the PDP State Congress held in Niger State, two weeks ago. Misau was also a chairman of the recovery panel set up by the state governor, Bala Mohammed.
