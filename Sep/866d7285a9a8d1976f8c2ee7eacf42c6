 KADUNA State Governor Nasir Ahmad El-Rufai has disclosed that it costs the state over N400,000 to treat each COVID-19 patient. El-Rufai said COVID-19 management is an expensive process and a big drain on the treasury of the government, which it must continue to bear, to prevent wider spread of the virus. The governor stated this in Kaduna during an executive committee meeting with northern traditional rulers chaired by the  Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammad Sa’ad Abubakar III. The governor said the amount is as a result of the  increasing cost of drugs, feeding of the patients and personal protective equipment (PPE) for doctors. He, however, said the government cannot tell patients to bear the cost of the treatment because it would be too much for many to bear and it would lead to further spread of the disease.
