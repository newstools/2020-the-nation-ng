A 20-year-old man was Monday killed and seven others injured after a locomotive train collided with a commercial bus and a Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV) at Public Works Department (PWD) Bus Stop by Agege Motor Road. It was gathered that the bus with registration number GGE972GE which had six occupants and a Highlander SUV carrying two persons had veered into the rail track in a bid to avoid congestion while crossing the railway outward Ikeja.   Unknown to the vehicles, other motorists were stopped to pave way for a scheduled commuter train which rammed into them and dragged both vehicles from PWD up to Bolade Bus Stop when the train came to a halt. Emergency workers were deployed to the scene as soon as the accident occurred and all eight persons were extracted from the vehicles.  According to Director General (DG) Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), Dr. Femi Oke-Osanyintolu, six of the victims sustained minor injuries and were treated on the spot by paramedics, while two who had severe injuries were evacuated to the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH) for further action. “However, the adult male lost his life. The two vehicles have been recovered off the road with the aid of the agency’s light rescue equipment while traffic management measures have been put in place by responders including TaskForce officials and police operatives.  “The public, especially drivers of commuter buses are reminded to obey traffic regulations to prevent loss of life, injuries, and transport delays. All vehicles are cautioned to stop at a level crossing and refrain from the dangerous habit of thinking they can smartly cross even when the train is already approaching,” said Oke-Osanyintolu.
