People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Anambra State on Thursday assured that candidates with issue-based campaigns would have brighter chances in the next year’s governorship election in the state. The Chairman of the party, Chief Ndubuisi Nwosu stated this when a governorship aspirant, Chief Ugochukwu, Okeke, visited the party’s Secretariat in Awka to declare his intention to contest in the poll on the party’s platform. He said the era of money bags politics in the party was over, insisting that credibility would form the bases on the choice of the governorship candidate of the party in the poll. He advised aspirants to avoid campaign of calumny, assuring of a free, fair, and credible primary. He said, “I wish everybody will see this election the way I see it. This election is not for money bags. It’s not about money but credibility. “Credibility of the candidate will be the major factor to consider in choosing our candidate. The candidate should be a grassroots person who understands the heartbeats of party members and those of the people of the state.” Nwobu, while wishing Okeke well in his ambition, enjoined him not to abandon the party in the event of failing to clinch the party’s ticket. Earlier, Okeke expressed confidence in his ability to clinch the party’s ticket. He stressed the place of unity and truth among members of the party, saying such virtues would guarantee a repeat of Edo’s experience. The aspirant who contested the same seat in 2013 on the same platform, said women and youths would dominate his government if voted to power.
