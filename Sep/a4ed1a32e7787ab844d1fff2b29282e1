A group, the Citizens Voice Against Corruption (CIVAC) has urged Nigerians to ignore moves by some vested interests to discredit the Justice Ayo Salami-Presidential panel by spreading baseless allegations and engaging in a campaign of calumny against it The group noted that the choice of Justice Salami, a distinguished jurist, as the head of the panel, investigating the allegations against the suspended Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu, has made some individuals jittery about the possible outcome of the probe. The group’s position is contained in a statement jointly signed and issued on Wednesday by Abdulrazaq Alkali of the Organization for Community Civic Engagement (OCCEN) and Princewill Okori of the Association for Public, Policy Analysis (APPA). Describing Justice Salami as a man of integrity, who is incorruptible, the group advised those behind the sinister moves against the panel to desist from attempts to derail the ongoing investigation process. CIVAC debunked insinuations about some sitting allowances and emoluments accruable to the panel members and assured that it was fully in support of the process and would see to it that the probe gets to a logical conclusion. “We are calling on Nigerians to disregard the baseless allegations and campaign of calumny against Justice Salami and other panel members working hard to investigate these allegations of corrupt acts and abuse of office and ensure that the culprits are brought to justice. “We also call on the authorities to ensure adequate security protection for Justice Salami and other panel members. “If the defendant’s team are not pleased with the procedure or do not believe in the legality of the investigation panel they are free to seek redress in a court of justice. “We will like to call on Justice Salami and his panel members to stay focused and not be distracted by the noise of those who are vehemently opposed to the anti-corruption crusade. “The recent move by the President Muhammadu Buhari administration to investigate allegations of corrupt practices within Nigeria’s anti-corruption agencies, particularly the EFCC, has been seen as a welcome development among Nigerians.”
