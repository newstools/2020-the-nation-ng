The Kano State government has secured Japan and European Union (EU) grants that will be used in cushioning the effects of COVID-19 during the pandemic’s post era. A statement by Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje’s Chief Press Secretary, Abba Anwar, on Wednesday said $1.1 million was voted for the programme. “In a Cash-For-Work arrangement, 1,600 individuals will benefit while 630 SMEs will benefit in the grant distribution process,” the statement said. Anwar added that the grants were facilitated through the Office of the Special Adviser on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Habibu Yahaya Hotoro, who is also the coordinating focal person of the Northwest Zonal SDGs Hub. He explained that the grants would be used on specific individuals and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), which will support the communities, which are badly affected by the pandemic. “This should allay the people’s fears of what they are going to face in the post-COVID-19 period,” he said. It was gathered that Ganduje was intimated of the grants in a letter by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), signed by Lealem Dinku, the Officer in Charge of UNDP in Nigeria. The letter, captioned: “Support to communities affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in Kano State,” said: “The COVID-19 pandemic has caused infections, deaths and untold hardships to the most vulnerable, particularly the urban poor in hotspots locations across the nation.
