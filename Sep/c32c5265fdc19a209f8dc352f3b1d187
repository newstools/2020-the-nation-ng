Lionel Messi has spoken about what was a difficult summer, explaining some of the criticism he has made of Barcelona in recent weeks. The forward was critical of the club’s planning in an interview given after he’d decided to stay and he also hit out at the way Luis Suarez’s departure was handled. Now, in an interview this Wednesday with Sport – of which an extract was published on Tuesday night – Messi has clarified his position. “I only said what I felt in some moments that were tough for me,” he told the Catalan publication. “I understand some people will think I should shut up or let things go, like I have done with many other things, but many things hurt me in these past few weeks and this was my way of expressing this.” Now, Messi is looking forward with optimism and is calling for unity.
