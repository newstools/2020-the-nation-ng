A former governor of Oyo State and an All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain, Adebayo Alao-Akala, has advised the incumbent Seyi Makinde against abusing or using foul language on his predecessors in any circumstance. Akala gave the advice in an interview with reporters at the empowerment programme of Sen. Fatal Buhari in Iseyin Friday. The lawmaker distributed vehicles, motorcycles, laptops, start-up capital and other items worth about N120 million to his constituents in the 13 local governments in Oyo North Senatorial District. While inaugurating the Light-Up Oyo State project in Ogbomoso on Wednesday, Makinde had stressed that his administration was delivering on its campaign promise to use the state’s resources to impact the people of the state. Judging by his administration’s achievements, the governor took a swipe at the opposition and vowed that “charlatans” would no longer govern Oyo State. But when asked to respond to Makinde’s attack, Alao-Akala said: “I don’t believe he said that. If he said that he is making a mistake. You don’t address your predecessors as charlatans. You don’t do that. It is unstatesmanly. You just have to talk like a statesman that he is going to be after he must have left office. “You would see the way we have been addressing him. None of us who has been in that office before has ever addressed him that he is not doing very well. He is doing his best. The best may not be enough for the people. When it is time for campaign, we will campaign. But don’t use that word ‘charlatan’ was unstatesmanly for him to use.”
