For 11 years a senior civil servant in Niger State was collecting the wages of his brother he hired as a ghost worker, it was said on Wednesday. Mohammed Ndanusa reportedly smuggled in his brother’s name into the government’s payroll since 2009. It was also learnt that Ndanusa even arranged to promote his ghost-worker brother several times. In a verification exercise, the ghost worker, Taminu Ndanusa, was discovered to be a commercial motorcyclist in Minna, who had no academic certificate of any kind, nor could he express himself in English. He also had no appointment letter nor account print-out. In halting pidgin Taminu Ndanusa said his brother asked him to appear for screening, adding that he knew nothing about his civil service career. The screening committee called in the police, who arrested the two Nadusas. Under interrogation, Mohammed Ndanusa reportedly confessed that he employed his brother at Grade Level 10 in 2009 and had been collecting his salary ever since in addition to his own. Commissioner of Police Adamy Usman confirmed their arrest, saying they would soon be charged to court.
