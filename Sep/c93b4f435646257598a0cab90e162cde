Governor of Delta, Sen. (Dr) Ifeanyi Okowa, has sent condolences to the family of the first elected Deputy Governor of the state, Mr Simeon Ebonka who passed on at 77. Ebonka, who hails from Owa-Alizomor in Ika North East Local Government Area, passed on in the early hours of Wednesday after a brief illness. He was elected Deputy Governor to late Chief Felix Ibru from 1992 to 1993. In a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Olisa Ifeajika, in Asaba on Wednesday, Okowa commiserated with the people of Ika Nation and Owa-Alizomor community in particular, over the demise of the renowned politician and evangelist. He noted that the departed Ebonka was a man of peace and administrator, who excelled as deputy governor of the state during the short time the administration lasted. The governor said that the deceased was an elder statesman whose fatherly role and wise counseling would be missed by his political family and Ika nation. He said, “On behalf of the government and people of Delta, I mourn the passing of our beloved elder statesman and first Deputy Governor of Delta, Mr Simeon Ebonka. “He was a very peaceful man who loved his people and served them to the best of his ability. “The news of his death came to me as a shock for he was a perfect gentleman-politician, who distinguished himself in the service of his people and Delta. “In the formative years of our great state, he played active roles in the putting government in place and will be long remembered for the great things he did for the state.” Okowa prayed to God to accept the deceased’s soul and grant fortitude to the family and friends he left to bear the loss.
