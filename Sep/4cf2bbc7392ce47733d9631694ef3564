Vee has expressed dislike for the current Head of House Erica. She stated this in a conversation with Laycon. Vee said she doesn’t like taking orders from people which is why she can’t come in terms with the actress. “I don’t like taking orders from people I don’t like,” she said. Vee said her dislike for Erica started when she (Vee) stood up for Laycon as a friend following his emotional breakdown. “I don’t like her, I just don’t. And to be very honest, it started with you.” Laycon however told Vee to remain calm because Erica is the Head of House.
