 The Edo State Government and stakeholders in the state’s mining sector have resolved to exploit more opportunities in the state’s solid minerals and mining sector so as to diversify earnings in a post-coronavirus (COVID-19) economy. The resolution was reached during a webinar themed, Investment Opportunities in the Minerals Value Chain and Capacity Strengthening of Local Miners in Edo State, organised by the Edo State Investment Promotion Office (ESIPO) and Nemoante, an advisory company involved in origination and project development across Africa. Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Mineral, Oil, and Gas, Barr. S.O. Oko-Ose, who represented the governor, said the state is ready to exploit its solid minerals deposit and expand the space for more investors to diversify its revenue base. He noted that players in the industry, BUA Group and Dangote Group, are already investors in the state, but that there was a need to attract more investors to saturate the space and provide more opportunities for job creation and prosperity. The DG Mining Cadastral Office, Engr. Simon Nkom, said it was delightful that Edo State is partnering with his office to promote investment in the mining sector. He said the state was a strategic location for the cadastral office’s operations which informed the opening of a regional office to cater to the needs of miners in the state. President, Women in Mining in Nigeria, Engr. (Mrs.) Janet F. Adeyemi, commended Edo State for organising the forum, noting that there was need to fast-track investment in infrastructure to attract more players in the industry. Managing Director, Nemoante, Erhabor Okogun, urged stakeholders to take advantage of already existing data to make investment decisions, and engage with financial institutions and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to open up the sector. Head, ESIPO, Kelvin Uwaibi, reiterated the readiness of the state government to unlock the state’s mining sector and pilot innovations to drive investment.
