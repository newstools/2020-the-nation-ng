Former Adamawa Acting Governor, Mr. James Barka, has left the All Progressives Congress (APC) for his former party, the Peoples Democratic Party ( PDP). Barka officially announced his return to the PDP on Thursday in Yola. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that Barka was the acting governor of Adamawa under the platform of PDP from February 2008 to April 2008. He was a former Nigeria’s Ambassador to Tunisia, under President Goodluck Jonathan’s administration, but dumped PDP for APC in 2014. “I only veered off into the APC, leaving my teeming supporters behind; and as you can see, I’ve returned home,” he said. Gov. Ahmadu Fintiri, who received the former acting governor, said that the doors of the PDP-led administration were wide open to well-meaning individuals. “Our doors are open to well-meaning individuals and groups of peoples who would support the development of our dear party, state, and country,” Fintiri said.
