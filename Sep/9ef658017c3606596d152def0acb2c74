A retired United States of America Army officer, Major Jide Ijadare has regained freedom from his abductors. Ijadare, who was kidnapped on Tuesday at his palm oil producing factory located along Ijan-Ise road in Ijan-Ekiti, Gbonyin Local Government was left off the hook after four days in the captivity. A contractor working with the factory was shot dead by the assailants in the process of perpetrating the evil deeds. Ijadare’s abduction came barely 48 hours after a Director in Gbonyin Local Council area, Mr David Jejelowo was shot dead by assailants. A family source told our reporter via a telephone conversation that the US army officer regained his freedom after paying the ransom demanded by the kidnappers. The source had on Wednesday revealed that the abductors had called few hours after the kidnapping and demanded N20 million ransom. “My brother was released this afternoon around 4.15pm and he has reunited with the family”. The Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Sunday Abutu, confirmed that the abductees had regained freedom. He, however, said the police were not aware of any ransom being paid before Ijadare’s release. “We are not aware of any ransom being paid. We believe he was released after the pressure the security agencies and local hunters piled up by combing the surrounding bushes.”
