Kiddwaya has made a U-turn saying he doesn’t know Nengi before the show. Kiddwaya had one time said he knew Nengi outside the house but they weren’t close. During a conversation with Erica, he denied ever knowing Nengi. “I don’t know Nene [Nengi] from anywhere before the house,” he told Erica. “She told me she found out I was coming here from an artist. I was wondering how because I came here low key with my plane and sometimes my driver.”
