Edo State chapters of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) are bickering over Channels Television’s debate, ahead of the September 19 governorship election. Edo APC, on Thursday in an online statement by the Chairman of its Media Campaign Council, Prince John Mayaki, warned PDP’s governorship candidate, Governor Godwin Obaseki, not to run away from Channels TV’s debate, stressing that he had shown a penchant for giving flimsy excuses for non-appearance at debates. The statement said assured that residents and other lovers of democracy would be treated to erudite debate from the APC standard-bearer, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, especially with his well-articulated SIMPLE agenda manifesto. The APC campaign council said debate was a very important part of a free and fair election, stressing that advanced countries of the western world adopted debate because it allowed people to know how brilliant and purposeful the candidates could be, when faced with one another’s ideas. PDP through its Publicity Secretary, Chris Nehikhare, said only Obaseki had workable agenda of Making Edo Great Again (MEGA). It described Ize-Iyamu’s SIMPLE agenda manifesto as worthless. PDP said the governor was ready to debate, noting that it would give him the opportunity to speak about his numerous achievements in almost four years and his consolidation plans, when re-elected on September 19, to continue his good programmes.
