The seven suspected political thugs arrested last week with firearms have been remanded to the custody of the Nigeria Correctional Service Centre, Olokuta Akure. They were remanded by an Akure Magistrate Court presided over by Magistrate Tope Aladejana. The seven suspects were arrested by security agents along Ikaro road, Ifon headquarters of Ose LGA on September 19, 2020 while parading the town with a branded campaign vehicle of Eyitayo Jegede, candidate of the Peopleâ€™s Democratic Party for the Ondo governorship election. Jegede has since disowned the suspected thugs. Director of Public Prosecution, Grace Olowoporoku, informed the court that the suspects were caught with locally made single and double barrel guns totaling seven with live cartridges and thereby committed an offense of felony contrary to and punishable under section 3 (1) of the robbery and firearms (Special Provisions) Act Cap R11 Vol. 14 Law of the Federation of Nigeria 2004. Olowoporoku prayed the court to remand the suspects to the custody of the Nigeria Correctional Service Centre since it lacked jurisdiction to entertain the case. The Magistrate therefore ordered the suspects remanded to enable the police conclude investigations into the incident. Ondo Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice Hon. Adekola Olawoye, said prosecution of the suspects was part of the duty of any responsible government to protect its citizens under the provisions of law. He queried intentions of the suspects parading the quiet town of Ifon with unlawful firearms and other dangerous weapons under the pretence of attending a political rally. Hearing on the matter has been adjourned to October 22, 2020.
