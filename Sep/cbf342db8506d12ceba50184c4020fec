Officials of Lagos Local Government Service Commission, Mr Babs Akinyanmi, and Mr Ladi Ajomale have urged civil servants to be proactive as the nation gradually returns to life after COVID-19. The duo made this appeal when they visited Igando-Ikotun Local Council Development Area (LCDA). Ajomale said, “All has to adhere strictly to the guidelines given by the government at all levels. As they say say, prevention is better than cure. We must give kudos to Lagos State government for ensuring that workers are paid even at this critical time.” Chairman of the LCDA Mrs Morenike Adesina Williams commended them for their work. Two buses were inaugurated during the visit for revenue collection in the council.
