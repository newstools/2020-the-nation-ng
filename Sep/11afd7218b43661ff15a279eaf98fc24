 REAL estate firm, Brains and Hammers, has said it is ready to partner with organisations to provide mass housing for Nigerians. The organisation said such partnership would go a long way in addressing Nigeria’s housing challenges and bridge the country’s housing deficits. The Group Head of City Project, Brains and Hammers, Hajia Maryam Bello, stated this in an interview. She stated: “We are approaching certain organisations who will give us money to build for them at a very low cost price. So if a government organisation is approaching us for housing for their staff, we are going to go to the lowest we can give. “We are open for partnership to provide mass housing at affordable rates. We are talking with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. They want us to build affordable housing on their behalf.” She said the organisation has completed the construction of phase 1 of the Brains and Hammers City located in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. “This first phase of the project comprises one thousand, two hundred (1200) completed housing units and currently has over 200 hundred residents occupying their homes. This was disclosed during a media tour of the completed and on-going projects within the city.” She added that “The Brains and Hammers City project was conceived as a self-sustaining and affordable housing project designed to cater to the housing needs of middle and low-income earners,” adding that it consists of one, two, and three-bedroom flats, as well as four-bedroom terraces and four-bedroom detached houses.
