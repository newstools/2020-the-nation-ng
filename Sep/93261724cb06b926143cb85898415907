Indian hemp-smoking thugs are still occupying Edo State House of Assembly complex on Ring Road, Benin, The Nation investigation has revealed. Our reporter, who was at the Assembly complex yesterday, saw fierce-looking thugs, who openly smoked Indian hemp under two canopies by the main entrance to the Assembly complex. Others loitered to ensure that the 17 All Progressives Congress’ (APC’s) lawmakers in the 24-member Assembly did not have access to the complex. The granite and sand poured on August 6 at the main entrance to the House of Assembly were still at the spot. There was no sign that they were being used by any contractor as claimed by Governor Godwin Obaseki, the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who stormed the House of Assembly with Deputy Governor Philip Shaibu and prevented the 17 APC lawmakers from sitting. The removed roofing sheets of the Assembly complex are yet to be replaced. No construction worker was seen despite the renovation claim by Governor Obaseki. The seven PDP lawmakers, led by Francis Okiye, are still sitting inside the Government House, Benin. The 17 APC legislators, with Victor Edoror as the Speaker, are sitting at an undisclosed location in Benin, to avoid being attacked, pending when they will have access to the Assembly complex. Edoror, at one of their recent sittings, urged security agents to eject the Indian hemp-smoking thugs from the Assembly complex, who allegedly looted valuables at the complex after defecating in the offices and Assembly complex.
