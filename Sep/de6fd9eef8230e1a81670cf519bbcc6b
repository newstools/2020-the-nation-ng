Brazilian attacking midfielder Phil Coutinho has returned to Barcelona after a year-long loan to Bayern Munich, which demolished the Spanish giants 8-2 in the Champions League quarter finals. He joined the Catalans just two weeks after scoring twice and assisting one for the eight-goal massacre. The ex-Liverpool player is hoping for a second chance with Barcelona after new coach Ronald Koeman asks to see him in training before determining his future.
