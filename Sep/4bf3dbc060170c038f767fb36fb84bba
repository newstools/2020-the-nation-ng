Ghost pensioners have withdrawn N700 million from the Bauchi State payroll account. The money was withdrawn in one year, a financial consulting firm, Dynatech Solutions Limited, contracted by the state to sanitise its nominal payroll, said. The firm made the revelation at a session with government officials and journalists on Thursday. “Some of these pensioners are not the beneficiaries of the money. There are inexistence accounts of inexistence banks. One of the pensioners was supposed to be paid N34,000 but received over N1,500,000. Another one who was supposed to be paid N50,000 but got over N1 million. All these accumulated to over N700 million,” Dynatech said. Governor Bala Mohammed said the revelation was embarrassing, urging the  Head of Service,  Ma’aji Abubakar to rid the service of ghost workers. Consequently, 100 ghost medical doctors  and  1,179 health workers  in the  Ministry of Health have been removed from its payroll. In Niger State, 80 civil servants have been dismissed from the state’s work force for fraud. The Head of Service Hajiya Salamatu Tani Abubakar said their offences included forgery of results, falsification of age and grade level. “There was an instance where a messenger in the state judicial service was found to be collecting the salary of a High Court judge. Also, a civil servant was impersonating the Commissioner of Agriculture and Rural Development, Aihaji Haruna Dukku and was collecting his salary and making it look as if he was earning double salary.”
