The Zenith Labour Party and its governorship candidate, Hon Agboola Ajayi, have denied a media report that there are alliance talks with the People’s Democratic Party and its candidate, Eyitayo Jegede. A spokesman for the ZLP, Mr. Felix Olatunde, said the party was not contemplating any alliance with the PDP and Jegede ahead of the October 10. Olatunde said it only has an alliance with the people of Ondo State to oust Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu and the APC from the Government House, Alagbaka. “The blatant lie reported by The Nation could at best be a product of the fertile imagination of the author and or his undisclosed source or sources,” Olatunde in the statement said. Agboola in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Babatope Okeowo, said the report was not only fake but planted by the information machinery of Akeredolu to discourage his supporters. He said the report exposed the sinister motives of the sponsors as it was made 24 hours after the State Government prevented his use of government facility for the launch of his campaign. “Let it be known to the members of the public that there is no romance between the candidate of ZLP and that of PDP after the governorship primary that produced Eyitayo Jegede as the candidate of PDP. There was no offer and rejection of running mate from the PDP leadership or Jegede to Ajayi as insinuated by the fake publication. The said publication has failed to prove any nexus between the two candidates and tried unsuccessfully also to impugn the character of the Deputy Governor. “We say emphatically that the Deputy Governor is winning the forthcoming governorship election slated for October 10, and he is willing to welcome candidates or other political parties who may wish to support his aspiration to rescue the state from the misrule of Akeredolu’s government.”
