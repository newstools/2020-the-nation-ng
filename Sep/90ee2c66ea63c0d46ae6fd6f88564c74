Guinness World Record breaker, Kafayat ‘Kaffy’ Shafau, and Segun Adefila have lent their voices to a documentary on the Nigerian dance industry. The documentary which is a product of a dance development platform, WAJO, captures commentaries from top dancers/troupe and stakeholders in its bid to reposition the sector as a profession and standardized it. The documentary also features Sir Peter Badejo, Sarah Boulos, and Qudus Onikeku, among others. Speaking at the private screening in Lagos, the Project Manager of WAJO, Wale Johnson explained that “For the Love of Dance” is part of its vision to promote dance in Africa by telling our story. “There is a need to understand the history of dance in Nigeria so that more people especially youths can understand what dance is all about,” said Johnson. “This documentary serves as a background of what has been evolving since 20 years ago. We have interviewed the key players in the Nigerian dance sector, I mean, professional dancers of different genres to discussed topical issues that are critical to our dance growth.” Johnson further said there’s a need to sensitise the general public against their perception of dancers.
