 SPECIAL Adviser to Edo State Governor on Media and Communication Strategy Crusoe Osagie has urged the electorate to go out and vote on September 19 without fear. He advised them to vote for Godwin Obaseki, the standard-bearer of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). Osagie, speaking in Benin, admonished Obaseki’s supporters to disregard alleged underhand tactics being deployed by leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to discourage them from coming out to vote. He said: “In the desperate tactics of the APC, its leaders have been confronted with the hard fact that Obaseki remains Edo voters’ preferred candidate. “The falsehood being disseminated by the APC is meant to manipulate the electorate and create a sense that their votes will not count, and ultimately create apathy and low voter turnout.” Obaseki’s media aide also enjoined the voters to re-elect the governor.
