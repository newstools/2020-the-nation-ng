 Ex-Arts, Culture and Special Duties commissioner during the administration of former governor Olusegun Mimiko, Mr. Femi Adekanmbi, has said the combined forces of the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) would not stop the re-election of Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu. He said Ondo State people would vote for a performing governor than the ones coming with experiments. Speaking in an interview in Akure, Adekanmbi said he resigned from the PDP for the APC to ensure the re-election of Governor Akeredolu. He urged candidate of the PDP, Eyitayo Jegede, to wait until it is the turn of the Central District to produce the governor and allow Ondo North complete its eight years in power. Adekanmbi dismissed insinuations that Deputy Governor Agboola Ajayi would pull unexpected strings at the polls.  He said:  “The deputy governor is pushing his luck too far. If the former deputy governor, Oluboyo, had got what Agboola is getting from Akeredolu’s administration, he would have been a happy man. What does the deputy governor want Akeredolu to do for him? He was given all the political powers in the state. Akeredolu gave him security vote and was even paying his wife. Majority of political decisions were taken by the deputy governor. Majority of the contracts in the South were through the deputy governor. He is not a threat to Akeredolu. ZLP cannot withstand APC. “The Central did eight years under Mimiko and for the governorship to go back to the Central Zone will be very unfair. Talking about Akure agenda, how many Akure indigenes are here? Majority of the people in Akure are foreigners. People from parts of the state are here. Jegede should wait for his time. How many of the over 260,000 voters in Akure do come out to vote? There are 160,000 voters in Owo. We have never recorded 100,000 votes. Has Akure ever recorded 100,000 turnouts?”
