Senior Special Assistant on Political Matters for Ondo South to Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, Mr. Andrew Ogunsakin, has resigned his appointment. Ogunsakin was said to be an ally of Deputy Governor of the State, Agboola Ajayi, who is the candidate of the Zenith Labour Party. He was said to be among the many political appointees influenced by Agboola. In his resignation letter dated September 18, 2020, Ogunsakin said, “The call of my constituents on me to join the train to actualize a common aspiration different from what is offered by your government and your party stands at the root of my decision to quit at this point “Being an appointee, this will necessarily conflict with the performance of my duty to you. Hence my resignation. “I thank your Excellency for the opportunity afforded me to serve the good people of Ondo State as SSA, for the period I was in office.”
