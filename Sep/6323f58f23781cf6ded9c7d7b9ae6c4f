Minister of Labour and Employment, Sen Chris Ngige has joined Ebonyi State Government to mourn the death of 22 persons in a road accident which occurred at Akaeze-Ukwu community in Ivo Local Government Area of the state. The 32-passenger bus was returning from a funeral in Afikpo South Local Government Area of the state to Enugu State when the accident occurred. This is just as the Police Command in the state said three more corpses had been recovered from the Akaeze-Ukwu River, where a Mercedes 608-model bus plunged into the river on Sept. 18. This brings the total of deaths in the accident to 22. The minister, in a statement from his Media Office and signed by Emmanuel Nzomiwu, described the road accident as a national disaster. The former Governor of Anambra State said this in a condolence message to the Governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi. Ngige expressed his deepest sympathies to the government and people of Ebonyi State on the tragic road mishap. The statement said: “On behalf of the entire members and staff of the Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment, I send my condolences and deepest sympathies to the government and people of Ebonyi State on the loss of many lives in the ghastly road accident that occurred on Friday, September 18, 2020 at Akaeze Bridge in Ivo Local Government Area of the State. “The news that over 30 lives were lost in the accident was very distressful and agonising to me. This is indeed a national disaster. “I understand the pain and anguish that those who lost their loved ones in the tragedy are experiencing at this time. My thoughts and prayers are with the families of the deceased, while I wish the injured, quick and speedy recovery. “My dear brother, the Governor of Ebonyi State, I stand with you and the entire people of Ebonyi State in this moment of grief and sorrow. “As we mourn, let us take solace in the fact that we all are mortals and will one day return to our creator.”
