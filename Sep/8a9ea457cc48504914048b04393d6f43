Allied Peoples Movement (APM) in Osun has expressed sadness over the state of infrastructure in the State. The party in a statement by the Chairman in Osogbo, Mr. Wale Adebayo, frowned at the All Progressives Congress-led government in Osun over the dearth of infrastructure in the state, 29 years after the creation of the state. The dream of the founding fathers of our state is for us to develop in both social and human development. The people of the state groan under the yoke of the heavy tax burden, hopelessness, lack of basic Medicare, and infrastructure. It also tongue-lashed the All Progressives Congress-led administration for failing to conduct local government election. ‘ The government is perpetrating lawlessness by using the caretaker committee to run and manage the local government administration’. The party urged the government to tow the line of constitutionalism by doing the needful to ensure the people at the grassroots feel the presence of government.
