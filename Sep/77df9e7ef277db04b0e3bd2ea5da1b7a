Bayern Munich returned to training on Tuesday for the 2020/2021 season, just over two weeks after completing a title treble with the UEFA Champions League crown. Bayern Munich players underwent coronavirus tests and then had a cyber training session from their homes, with the first full session on the training ground not scheduled until Friday. Their first-round Cup match against fifth-tier Dueren, originally scheduled for the weekend, has been postponed to mid-October to give them more pre-season preparation time. They kick off their Bundesliga season Sept. 18 against Schalke 04 and then play UEFA Europa League winners Sevilla six days later in the European Super Cup in Budapest. Bayern Munich won the Bundesliga and German Cup in the past season. They then completed their second treble in club history on Aug. 23 when they beat Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) 1-0 in the UEFA Champions League final in Lisbon. Also on Tuesday, Munich said newly-signed defender Tanguy Nianzou was out “for the foreseeable future”. This came after he suffered a thigh muscle injury during training with the French under-20 national team. There are suggestions that the 18-year-old, who arrived from PSG, could miss up to six weeks.  (dpa/NAN)
