Dorathy has warned Ozo to thread carefully in his relationship with Neo. Dorathy called Ozo’s attention to his closeness with Neo, saying he has gotten fined for microphone infringement due to his recent closeness with Neo. She advised him to focus more on the price and not give chances for any distraction. “You started getting in trouble and got fined for microphone infringement when you started getting close to Neo. “Neo speaks in low tones and gets away with it unlike you. “I didn’t want to mention it earlier because I like to mind my business and not get involved with anything that involves others,” she said. Dorathy and Ozo used to be very close until he picked interest in Nengi.
