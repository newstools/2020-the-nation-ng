The Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) has announced the resumption of Lagos-Ogun Mass Transit Train Services (MTTS) from Monday, after five months of suspension to contain the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. The District Manager, NRC, Lagos, Mr. Jerry Oche, in a statement yesterday by Dr. Khadijah Aroyewun-Adekomaiya, the district spokesperson, said: “NRC is set to resume its Mass Transit Train Services (MTTS) on Monday. “The resumption is coming after a compulsory shutdown of train operations on March 23, due to the novel Coronavirus outbreak. “Following the guidelines by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) for the reopening of rail transportation within established parameters, the Nigerian Railway Corporation has made important changes to the delivery of services on its Mass Transit Trains. “Our MTTS will now cost N460 flat per trip and the trains will no longer stop at some stations.” Oche said trains coming from Ijoko would only stop at Ebute Metta Junction and Iddo stations. He added that the return trains originating from Iddo would terminate at Ijoko only. “It is to be noted that the MTT train will leave Ijoko by 6:30am and Iddo by 7:30 pm. “In strict adherence to NCDC’s guidelines for public engagement, no passengers will be allowed to board the train without a face mask and hand sanitiser. “This is an addition to the measures the NRC management has taken to ensure proper social distancing while boarding and on board the MTTS,” Oche said. According to him, in addition to strict social distancing measures on board the Mass Transit Trains, seats marked ‘X’ are NOT to be sat on. Oche ruled out standing or hanging on the train. “This will not be tolerated. It is to be noted that defaulters of these laid down rules will be prosecuted,” the NRC boss said.
