In continuation of our review, today we will focus on the changes that affect the Value Added Tax Cap V1, LFN 2004 and the Capital Gains Tax Act Cap.C1, LFN 2004 as amended, with a view to guide corporate and individual taxpayers on the impact of the Finance Act on their businesses.  Review of key changes – Value Added Tax Act  All taxable persons are required to file monthly VAT returns in the old Act. This has been amended such that only a taxable person who, in the course of a business, has made taxable supplies or expects to make taxable supplies, the value of which, either singularly or cumulatively in any calendar year, is N25,000,000 or more shall file monthly VAT returns, while a taxable person who generates revenue below N25,000,000 is exempted from filing monthly VAT returns. Section 15, Subsection 2 states that “in determining whether a person meets the threshold turnover of N25,000,000 or more in any calendar year, the value of the following taxable supplies shall be excluded”: The taxpayer whose turnover does not fall within the threshold of N25,000,000  as stated above is exempted from: iii. Issuing of tax invoices; VAT was accounted for on an Invoice basis in the old Act. This has been changed to cash basis in the new Act. Tax payable is computed as the difference between the input tax paid and output tax collected by the taxpayer in the preceding month. Section 61(1) states that, a taxable person shall, on rendering a return under S.15(1) of this Act – The implication of S.16(1b) is that cash refund or combination of both cash and credit refund method permitted in the old Act has been repealed. Taxable person can now only be entitled to credit refund against subsequent tax payable. The old section 19 has been substituted with a new section 19 wherein the penalty for failure to remit tax at the specified time has been increased from five per cent to 10 per cent of the tax payable. Section 21 of the old Act in respect of VAT Technical Committee to advise the FIRS has been deleted in the new Act. The penalty for failure was N5,000 flat in the old Act but now amended in the new Act to N50,000 in the month in which the failure occurs and N25,000 for each subsequent month in which the failure continues. PART I of the Schedule to Value Added Tax Act has been amended by the addition of new paragraph 10 after paragraph 9 wherein Locally manufactured sanitary towels, pads or tampons are now VAT exempt. PART II of the Act has been amended by the deletion of Community Bank and replacement with Micro Finance Bank to the list of exempt services. The new Act also introduced paragraph Five to this PART which includes Tuition relating to Nursery, Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Education to the list of exempt services.  Review of key changes – Capital Gains Tax Act This section has been substituted with a new section 32 which excludes assets sold or transferred between related parties in the course of business reorganisation from tax as long as the companies are members of a recognised group of companies and must have been so for a consecutive period of at least 365 days prior to the date of re-organisation. However, if the acquiring company were to make a subsequent disposal of the assets acquired within the succeeding 365 days of the transaction, this concession shall be rescinded. S.36(2) was amended such that compensation for loss of employment of N10,000,000 and below is exempted from Capital Gains Tax instead of the N10,000 stated in the old Act.
