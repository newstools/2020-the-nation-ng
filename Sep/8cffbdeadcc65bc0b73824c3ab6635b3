The Nigeria Golf Federation (NGF) in collaboration with an Abuja-based Marvellous Mike Press, will be unveiling an historic Nigerian Golf book titled ‘Who is who in Nigeria golf’. The book which will be set for launch with a Pro-Am Golf tournament offers one giant leap into golfing history since the game was first played at the Sapele Golf Club in present day Delta State in 1897. The book, an all colour 500-page will feature the profile of 250 Nigerian golfers who over the years have rendered selfless service to ensure rapid growth of the game in Nigeria. Who is who in Nigeria Golf which is packaged by the nation’s foremost golf writer, Tony Akhigbe, is expected to enjoy wide circulation among golfers within and outside Nigeria. President of NGF Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola disclosed that the nation’s golf was overdue for a quality documentation of a game that was first played in Nigeria some 150 years ago. “This is one book that gladdens my mind and those of members of the Board of the Nigeria Golf Federation,” Oyinlola said. “One good thing will surely come out of this book. It will act as a sort of “Hall of Fame” to those who are giving to the game presently and many more who will support golf in future.”
