The Coalition of Democrats for Electoral Reforms (CODER) on Thursday listed the conditions for a free and fair governorship election in Edo State. Its national coordinator, Temitope Shaba and spokesman, Ayodele Adewale, told reporters in Benin-city, the state capital that the exercise will be peaceful and credible if participants play by the rules of the game. CODER is an accredited CSOs for the Edo poll. It has been monitoring political developments in the state, particularly the trend of violence, vandalism or destruction of property associated with candidates, stock piling of small arms and light weapons and recruitment of armed thugs or militia groups. Shaba hailed the intervention of the Oba of Benin and the peace accord signed by candidates. He appealed to political actors in the two dominant political parties to sue for peace and allow the people to speak through the ballot. Shaba said:”The Nigeria Police Force and other security personnel on election duty must maintain their neutrality and be ready to arrest anyone that commits electoral offence. “INEC on the other hand must be seen to play its role as an unbiased umpire in the entire process to increase people’s confidence and trust in both the electoral process and the electoral management body.”
