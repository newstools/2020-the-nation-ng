 An Abuja-based lawyer, Daniel Makolo, detained for two weeks by the police over a complaint by the Controller-General of Immigration, Muhammed Babandede, has faulted the conduct of the authorities of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Police Command. Mr Makolo, who was only released on the intervention of his colleagues, expressed dismay last Tuesday when lawyer to the FCT Police Command, Adama Musa failed to attend court for the scheduled commencement of trial in the case brought against him by the police. Makolo said he had gone to represent a client at the FCT Police Command in Garki on August 10 where Mr Musa attended to him only to direct his arrest while he was stepping out of his (Musa’s) office. He said the police obtained a remand order for his detention from the Chief Magistrate Court in Karu, Abuja on August 11, 2020. The police, in an application for remand dated and filed on August 4, 2020, claimed that it acted based on a complaint by Babandede.  Inspector Phillip Tumba, who claimed to be investigating the lawyer, said, in a verifying affidavit, that the case against him borders on “criminal conspiracy, criminal intimidation, cyber stalking and threat to life, contrary to sections 97, 396, 393 and 24 of Penal Code and Cyber crimes (prohibition, prevention, etc) Act, 2015.” Makolo, who denied the allegations against him, noted that while the court granted the police’s request in Asokoro, he was detained in three different locations, including Nyanya in the outskirts of the FCT. The lawyer was said to have drawn Babandede’s ire by his letter to the Minister of Interior, allegedly querying the elongation of the tenure of the Immigration Controller-General. At the mention of the case on Tuesday, the prosecution was to open its case, but Musa was absent. He wrote to inform the court that he was indisposed. The magistrate then adjourned till September 28.
