The Executive Secretary of State Management Agency (SEMA), Dr. Emmanuel Shior, has disclosed that over 500,000 Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) are to benefit from CACOVID palliatives in Benue State. Dr. Shior stated that the IDPs are in eight (8) camps across Benue State. He said Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, before the outbreak of coronavirus, had been catering for the IDPs and the food items donated by the federal government through CACOVID palliatives would also go along to provide the needs of the displaced persons. Addressing journalist in Makurdi during the distribution of last batch of COVID-19 palliatives, Shior said Orton has directed the distribution of all the food items in SEMA warehouse in Makurdi to the IDPs, who have been living in the camps for over three (3) years as a result of farmers-herdsmen clash. The Nation gathered that since 2018 when suspected herdsmen launched attacks on farmers in Guma, Agatu, Logo, Gwer West and Makurdi local government areas, farmers have fled their villages and have taken refuge in IDP camps.
