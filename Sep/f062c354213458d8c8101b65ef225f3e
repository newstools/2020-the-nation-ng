As the economy gradually reopens amid the impact of COVID-19, Stanbic IBTC Holdings Plc, a member of Standard Bank Group, has urged vital players in the education sector to create and explore collaboration opportunities. Education has been one of the sectors severely hit by the coronavirus pandemic. Learning institutions have had to deliver lessons to students with varying levels of successes. However, some could not hold due to lack of infrastructure. A few of the gaps in the sector include requisite teachers’ training, lesson delivery, curriculum content and school infrastructure, and these provide an opportunity for collaboration. Executive Director, Personal and Business Banking, Stanbic IBTC Bank PLC, Remmy Osuagwu, however, urged parents and guardians to give their children the best education. He noted that good education without hassles is a legacy for children. He advised parents to invest in their wards’ education. “The COVID-19 pandemic was unprecedented, but it has reinforced the need to plan for the future of our children. Early planning helps to take the financial pressure off parents in the years to come; and in times like these, parents must ready to welcome opportunities that will amplify the value of their children’s education. “As a foremost financial institution that understands the importance of protecting a child’s future by saving for their education, the Stanbic IBTC Children Education Savings Scheme – CHESS account enables parents /guardians to set up and manage their child’s account just the way they want,” he said.
