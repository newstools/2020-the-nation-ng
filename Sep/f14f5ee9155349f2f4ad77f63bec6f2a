 PARENTS of killed Benue militia leader Terwase Akwaza, also known as Gana, have dismissed reports claiming that their son left behind 200 well-trained bandits. Speaking on the telephone with The Nation, Mr and Mrs. Kunenge Iornder Akwaza said the reports were false. They also dissociated themselves from one  Aondohemba  Major who reportedly made the claim. They said they did not support Gana’s criminal activities, but supported him when he repented, accepted Christ, and was on his way to be pardoned. Gana’s parents also said his surrender before his killing meant he wanted peace in Sankera area where he ruled. The father and mother of Gana stated further that they are in support of peace to return to Sankera -geo political zone and pleaded with the federal government especially the military to release the body of their son for a decent burial .. “Since our son Gana embraced Christ and repented before his killing we beg the military to release his body to  us to give him a decent burial “
