 Nigerian international forward Victor Osimhen  missed Napoli’s training yesterday due to some ‘bureaucratic procedures’  ahead of today’s  pre-season  match friendly against Prescara. It was the first time  the 21-year-old Osimhen  was missing in training since joining Napoli in a record transfer from Lille of France but the Gil Azzurri  cleared the air in a  terse statement , saying  the 21-year-old had to skip training because he was struggling with the paperwork related to the passport.  “Osimhen was not present at the training to carry out bureaucratic procedures relating to the passport,” the club said on its website. All thing being equal, Osimhen would expectedly lead the attack of the coach Gennaro Gattuso ‘s side against Prescara  today. According to Gattuso, the high profile matches would be used to ascertain the readiness of the Gli for the new season.
