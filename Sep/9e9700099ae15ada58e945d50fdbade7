A group, the Edo Equity Forum, has hailed the Oba of Benin, Ewuare ll, for quickly intervening to ensure violence-free election on September 19. It described as commendable, the first-class monarch’s Wednesday’s instruction that Edo top politicians must ensure that they and their supporters conduct themselves in an atmosphere of peace. The group, through its leader, Benjamin Omoigui, at a news conference on Thursday in Benin, said the peace parley initiated by the Oba of Benin would douse the already-heightened tension in the state.
