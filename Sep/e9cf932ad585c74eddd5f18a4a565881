 ONDO State Deputy Governor and governorship candidate of the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP), Agboola Ajayi, has given reasons he will emerge victorious at the polls on October 10. He boasted that he would defeat the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Eyitayo Jegede and the standard-bearer of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu. Ajayi said the ruling APC had failed the people with what he termed lacklustre performance of Governor Akeredolu, adding that the PDP had no structure to win election in Ondo State. The deputy governor spoke while receiving former PDP members in Okitipupa Local Government, led by a former governorship aspirant, Mr. Banji Okunomo and an ex-chairman of the local government, Mr. Solomon Bitire. He said PDP breached the zoning arrangement and would, therefore, be punished by voters. Ajayi said the achievements of Akeredolu in the last three and a half years fell short of people’s expectations, as the governor had personalised government. In Akure South where Ajayi received some former APC members led by the party’s Secretary, Mr. Olukayode Abiodun, the deputy governor said the people would punish Akeredolu with their votes. He hailed the defectors for displaying high level of patriotism.
