The Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) has advised universities on strict compliance with COVID-19 protocols to ensure the safety of students and curtail the spread of the virus on campuses. Kwara State Chairman of the association Prof. Baba Issa stated this on Monday when he visited the Vice-Chancellor of University of Ilorin, Prof. Sulyman Abdulkareem, in his office. According to him, the call has become necessary as universities get ready for the resumption of academic activities. He said the NMA was working hard to curtail the spread of the virus and suggested that universities should strictly enforce social distancing, regular handwashing, use of hand sanitiser and face masks. Issa counselled further that university staff should be rotated to limit the possibility of infection spread when academic activities fully resumed. The chairman noted that being the highest employer of labour in the state, it was pertinent for the association to visit the university and strengthen the relationship between them. He expressed the association’s gratitude to the vice-chancellor for appointing medical doctors into various positions in the institution.  Issa appealed for the appointment of more medical personnel to complement the ones at the university clinic. The NMA chairman also appealed for statutory allowances to be paid to doctors in the university and for medical students with resit exams to be allowed to sit for the examination. Welcoming the chairman and his team, Abdulkareem expressed his great respect for the medical profession. “You are good at managing people. I have the belief that if you want things done right, gets the doctors involved,” he said. The vice-chancellor promised to look into the requests made once they were formally presented to him in writing.
