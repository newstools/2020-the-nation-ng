Bolaji Ogundele, Abuja President Muhammadu Buhari has described the flood disaster in Kebbi State as a major setback to the national effort to boost rice production in the country. President Buhari, in a statement issued by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, also expressed concerns over the loss of lives and property to the flooding in the affected communities. According to the President, “I am particularly sad over this incident because it’s a setback to our efforts to boost local rice production as part of measures to stop food importation.” Buhari noted that “Kebbi State is the focal point of our policy to produce rice locally as part of this administration’s commitment to agricultural revival which suffered relative neglect in favour of food importation.” He said that “With the loss of six lives and still counting; thousands of hectares of land flooded and estimated economic losses of more than one billion Naira by rice farmers in Kebbi State; we face a major setback in our efforts to boost local food production.” President Buhari noted that “This bad news couldn’t have come at a worse time for our farmers and other Nigerians who looked forward to a bumper harvest this year to reduce the current astronomical rise in the costs of food items in the markets.” The President, while sympathising with the bereaved families and farmers affected by the devastating floods, has assured that “we are going to work closely with the Kebbi State government in order to bring relief to the victims.”
