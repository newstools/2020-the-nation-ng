 THE Lagos State Government on Sunday announced the reopening of two of its recreational parks for public use, stressing that visitors to the parks must comply with the subsisting COVID-19 protocols. Mrs. Titilayo Ajirotutu, the Assistant Director, Public Affairs, Lagos State Parks and Gardens (LASPARK), stated this in a statement in Lagos. According to Ajirotutu, the reopened recreational facilities are the Ndubisi Kanu Park in Alausa and the Dr. Abayomi Finnih Park in Oregun, Ikeja. The government had closed down all parks at the wake of the Coronavirus pandemic to contain the community spread of the virus. This measure denied fun-seekers the opportunity to relax in the open and hindered government revenue from the facilities.
