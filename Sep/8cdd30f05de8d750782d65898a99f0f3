In furtherance of its drive to provide potable water and improve livelihoods in several rural communities across Nigeria, Notore Chemical Industries Plc has donated a 40,000-litre solar-powered integrated water project to Kangare Community in Bauchi Local Government, Bauchi State. The project is a key part of the company’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) aimed at enhancing the wellbeing of farmers and communities in which it operates in Nigeria. The company will also sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Bauchi State Government to provide farmers inputs at affordable prices in 20 local government areas of the state. Group Managing Director/GCEO of Notore, Mr. Onajite Okoloko, who was represented by the company’s Head of Government Affairs, Mr. Yakubu Abdurrahman, at the inaugurating of the water project in Kangare, said: “As an active member of the Kangere farming community, Notore noted the shortage of potable drinking water as one of the major social challenges facing the community. Consequently, we decided to construct a 40,000 litre capacity solar powered water project to support the state government’s visible efforts at ameliorating the living conditions of the good people of Bauchi.” He noted that the integrated water project was meant to show the company’s support to Governor Bala Mohammed’s efforts at improving lives. According to him, “To drive home our aim of championing Africa’s green revolution, through increased farm yields, Notore has recruited over 3,600 world class extension service professionals to work hand- in-hand with farmers in almost all the 774 local government areas in the country, teaching them best farming practices.”
