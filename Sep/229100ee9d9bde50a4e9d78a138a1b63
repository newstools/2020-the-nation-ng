Analysts at Afrinvest Securities attributed the sustained rally to positive developments in the Nigerian foreign exchange market, better-than-expected corporates earnings and improved economic activities.  “While we expect the soft gains in the domestic market to be sustained, we note that investors are likely to pocket gains in the week ahead. Also, the resumption of foreign exchange sales could provide foreign investors the long-waited opportunity to sell their stakes and limit exposure. Thus, we anticipate a mixed performance in the coming week,” Afrinvest Securities traded. Analysts at Cordros Securities remained cautious citing combined risks of increasing number of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria and weak economic conditions. “Thus, we continue to advise investors to seek trading opportunities in only fundamentally justified stocks,” Cordros Securities stated.
