Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has broken his silence on the failed move for Barcelona talisman, Leo Messi. In August, Messi dropped the bombshell news that he wanted to leave Barcelona on a free transfer after nearly two decades with the club. But the Catalans blocked his exit from the Camp Nou. City was one of the few clubs with the pulling power and financial strength to attract the six-time Ballon d’Or winner, with the added attraction of him working again with his former mentor Guardiola. And when asked about the transfer and City’s stance, Guardiola told reporters: “I don’t need to explain anything. Leo explained it quite well I think and I don’t have anything to add. “We don’t have anything more to add. He is a football player for FC Barcelona – the club I love.” Guardiola has long hailed Messi as the best player in the world and even at 33, he still rates his undoubted ability. Messi can walk away for nothing next summer but Guardiola, who is also in the final 12 months of his contract, did not want to comment about the possibility of the club returning for him. “I don’t know, it’s a question for Leo Messi,” he added. “I cannot talk about the intentions of other people.” Messi cited a long-standing dispute with Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu as one of his key reasons for wanting to leave the club. He is now facing is a premature end to his tenure after a vote of no confidence in him was called by members at Guardiola’s former club.
