 ALL Progressives Congress (APC) has raised the alarm over unjust arrest and assault of its member, Abdul Ganiyu, by security officials at Okpella, Etsako East Local Government, over unfounded allegations levelled against him by leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). APC, through the Chairman of its Media Campaign Council, Prince John Mayaki, said Ganiyu, an engineer and members of his family suffered inhumane treatment by security officials, who it said acted on false information. APC described as unfortunate, police falling prey to the antics of the PDP that were fond of blaming orchestrated violence on others. It said: “Ganiyu and members of his family were going home when they were stopped and assaulted by security officials, who were acting on a false tip-off from Governor Godwin Obaseki; his deputy, Philip Shaibu; and members of the PDP.” “The PDP members, working in cahoots with Shaibu, had characteristically fomented trouble at Okpella, but kept up with their usual antics of blaming the violence on others, with a swift SOS to the police, demanding the arrest of Ganiyu.
