The University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN), has taken the fight against coronavirus (COVID-19) to a new level by launching a contactless digital hand cleaning machine that uses censor to monitor body temperature, dispense hand sanitiser, detergent and water. Inspecting the equipment produced by the Faculty of Engineering last week, the Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Charles Igwe, said that the machine was an improvement over the manual hand cleaning machine that dispensed detergent and water. “This machine is different from what we have seen before, it performs four functions at a time without the user making any physical contact”, the Vice-Chancellor said after using the machine to clean his hand and measure his temperature. Igwe, who recently marked his birthday, said that the digital machine could be considered his best birthday gift. He challenged the Faculty of Engineering and others in the university to come up with more inventions, products and designs that would have direct impact on the society. “We should go beyond writing research papers to fabrication of machines, equipment and designs that will solve the numerous problems in our society,” he said. The Dean, Faculty of Engineering, Prof. Emeka Obe, said the machine was produced within four weeks by the Auto Service Centre of the faculty. He said that the production cost, estimated at over N300,000, was contributed by staff members in the service centre. The dean appealed for sponsorship to enable the faculty mass produce the machine which he believed would simplify the process of monitoring prevention against the COVID-19.
