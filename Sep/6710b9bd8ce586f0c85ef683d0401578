 The administrative football crisis in Delta State took a new twist at the weekend as some powerful forces reportedly  mounted pressure on FA chairman, Edema Fuludu and vice, Victor Ikpeba, to stage a fresh election in the state. It will be recalled that the normalization committee set up by the Nigeria Football Federation recently indicated that a fresh election will be staged today but Edema  vowed not to be part of illegality. He said: “I have received many calls but the legitimacy of the current board remains intact. We cannot sell our conscience. Our aim is to make football grow in the state but the obstacles we are facing are too much. So much power play from Delta to Abuja over the selfish interest of those involved in the bad politics.” Meanwhile, the Chairman of the Rivers State Football Association and a former member of the NFF, Barr. Chris Green, also faulted the setting up of a normalization committee to run football in Delta State and also the move to stage a fresh election in the state today. “I don’t know where they get the normalization from because it is not in the football statute.  It is so strange and sad for the development of the game,” Green said in a letter to the NFF.“ And so, the conduct of a fresh election in Delta state is unsupportable and amounts to the executive committee of the NFF abrogating to itself the powers of the Congress.”
