 THE Body of Benchers, the body responsible for the regulation of law education, has scheduled for September 15 this year, the call to Bar ceremony for successful students, who sat for the January 2020 Bar final examination of the Nigerian Law School (NLS). In a notice to its members and “aspirants to the Bar,” it said parents and guardians of the students are barred from the event, which would be held at the Eagle Square, Abuja, as part of the coronavirus control measures. The notice signed by the body’s Secretary, Mrs. H. A. Turaki, reads: “The choice of the Eagle Square was made due to its semblance with the National Stadium, since it is an open-spaced facility. “It will give room for better ventilation considering the guidelines on curbing the spread of COVID-19 virus. “We regret to inform the parents/guardians of the aspirants and the general public that the ceremony is strictly for the aspirants. “However, parents/guardians are advised to watch the ceremony through national television as there is going to be live streaming of the ceremony on national television and other social media platforms. “Aspirants should note that they are required to be seated by 8:303m. Late coming will not be tolerated.”
