Anthony Joshua is adamant neither he nor Tyson Fury are overlooking their respective “banana skin” opponents as anticipation builds towards a potential showdown between the two world heavyweight champions next year. It is understood Joshua’s defence of his WBA, IBF and WBO crowns against Kubrat Pulev has been pencilled in for December 12 at London’s O2 Arena while Fury, the WBC champion, is committed to a third bout with Deontay Wilder. Joshua’s promoter Eddie Hearn and Fury himself have already confirmed an initial agreement is in place for a blockbuster two fights between the British pair next year provided they avoid upset defeats in their next contests. Joshua knows from bitter experience that nothing can be taken for granted after last year’s loss to Andy Ruiz Jr which sent shockwaves through the sport and although that was avenged, the Watford fighter is focused on Pulev. Pulev has won his last eight fights since suffering the only defeat of his professional career to Wladimir Klitschko in 2014, while Wilder’s explosive power is well-renowned after amassing 41 stoppages in his 42-1 record. Asked who has the sterner test, Joshua told the PA news agency: “We’ve got to put them on an equal playing field because if I say ‘I’ve got the bigger test’ or ‘he’s got the bigger test’, you never know what’s going to happen. “They’re both banana skin fights. It’s like ‘get past this one then there’s the big one next’, so this one is just as important as the big one. “When the time’s right we’ll fight. We’re keen but I’ve got Kubrat Pulev first which is a mandatory defence, which I have to do. Once I get past that I’m a free agent. “I’m going to say we’ll fight next year but everything else that comes with it, I’ve just got to put to the back of my mind and just focus on Kubrat Pulev. Once I get past him, hopefully Fury will be the next one in line.”
