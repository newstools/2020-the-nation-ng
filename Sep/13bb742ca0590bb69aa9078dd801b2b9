 VICTOR Osimhen is looking forward to coming up against Juventus superstar Cristiano Ronaldo in the Serie A this season. Osimhen joined Napoli from Ligue 1 club Lille in July. The new season will kick-off in Italy this weekend with Napoli facing Parma in their first game of the campaign. Napoli’s first tough fixture of the season will be away to champions on matchday three. The game will see Osimhen come up against Ronaldo for the first time in his career. “I’m really looking forward to a new career here in Serie A. Playing against the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo is something one can eagerly wait for,” Osimhen told cafonline.com. “While at Lille, I had the opportunity of playing against some of the best players in the world like Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and it would definitely be a whole great experience to play against Ronaldo, who is one of the greatest players on earth. “So, I’m looking forward to facing him soon.” The Nigeria international scores six goals and provided one assist in three pre-season outings for the Partenopei.
