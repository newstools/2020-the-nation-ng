Making a cue from the market performance in first half, Nigerian equities may sustain a lacklustre performance in the remaining months of this year. But investors with long-term horizon stand to achieve higher returns in the medium to long-term. In its outlook for the second half, Afrinvest West Africa stated that although market sentiments are weak, there is room for alpha driven by the undervaluation of the market, hence, the strategic equity play for the rest of the year should be centred on long-term positioning. “We recommend a long-term investment horizon in undervalued stocks with potential to maintain positive earnings growth amidst the current downturn and deliver high dividend yield,” Afrinvest stated. Analysts said all scenarios pointed at the market closing 2020 negative with a stronger probability that the market would close 2020 with double digit negative return of up to -11 per cent. According to analysts, the continuous spread of the virus threatens to disrupt the on-going gradual reopening of the economy, with governments mulling increasing lockdown measures. However, the early discovery of a vaccine would significantly change this expectation. While analysts have less worry over the readiness of Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) coalition to rebalance the oil market given that output cut agreements are in place until April 2022, they are somewhat concerned about the gradual recovery in demand given the slow paced reopening in global economies and the possibility of a second phase of lockdown.
