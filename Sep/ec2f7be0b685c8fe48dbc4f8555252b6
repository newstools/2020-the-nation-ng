 There is need for those in authority to clarify the true state of affairs at the Old Oyo National Park located in Kishi town. For about a week now, claims have been rife that armed groups have taken over the park. While many are not taking the allegations seriously, Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Chief Gani Adams, has added his voice to the worrisome claims, saying the park now habours “armed terrorists.” According to him and others, the armed groups are already engaging in criminal activities like kidnapping, rape and robbery, so much so that the area is gradually becoming a haven for bandits and terrorists. They warn that the situation must be nipped in the bud to prevent further violence. Surprisingly, no official statement has been made by anyone in authority since the allegations started. Sentry thinks the state governor should speak up on the matter. The alleged killing and kidnapping of over 100 people is not only frightening and worrisome, but requires urgent confirmation or denial from those in authority.
