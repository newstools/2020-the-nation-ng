Officials of Lagos State government on Thursday dislodged an illegal slaughter slab in the Okerube area of Alimosho Local Government Area. They arrested 10 butchers and confiscated two  live cows, as part of the government’s drive to clean up slaughter slabs in the state. The onslaught was carried out by men of the re-inaugurated Monitoring, Enforcement and Compliance Team of the State Ministry of Agriculture in furtherance of the sanitisation of the red meat value chain. The State Acting Commissioner for Agriculture, Ms. Abisola Olusanya, who made this known yesterday, explained that the exercise was coming on the heels of repeated warnings to the operators of illegal slaughter slabs and the menace of their activities. “This dislodgement exercise is necessary especially as the state is particular about the production of wholesome and healthy meat for its residents while simultaneously ensuring that the streets are free of stray animals. We will also strictly enforce meat transportation using only the designated vehicles and stray animals control which has lately become more rampant in the State,” the Acting Commissioner said.
