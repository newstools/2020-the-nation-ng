The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Ogunsanwo has been behind entertainment successes such as Ojukokoro, Knockout Blessing, Jemeji, and Ajoche. “The cast and crew of the movie have been carefully selected to ensure that the viral story is retold on video without losing any of the elements that made it a fan-favourite. “It was an exhilarating experience creating a movie out of this story that was followed by over two million people online and on the radio. “I can’t wait for fans to see what will definitely be the most talked-about movie this year,” Ogunsanwo said. He added that “Finding Hubby” explored themes of friendship, love, and finding happiness in oneself.
