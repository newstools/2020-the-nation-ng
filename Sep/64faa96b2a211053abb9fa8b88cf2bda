A group, ‘The Association of Edo Professionals (Edo Professionals),’ on Wednesday called for a peaceful governorship poll in Edo State. The association advised politicians and voters to shun thuggery and violence in the interest of the state. The election, said the group, should not be a do-or-die affair. Its Secretary, Clifford Enobun, in a statement thanked the Oba of Benin, Ewuare 11 and the National Peace Committee led by Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, for dousing intra-party crisis in the state. However, he flayed some traditional rulers for meddling in politics. Urging the stakeholders to respect the peace accord, Enobun advised them to shun character assassination, defamation, peddling of fake news, half-truths and falsehood. He said thuggery before, during and after the election is an anti-democratic tendency that is inimical to democratic culture. Enobun urged security agencies to offer “uncompromised watertight security networks” during the exercise. Hr also advised the Independent National Electoral Commission to transparently play the role of an umpire. Enobun said: “We urge all citizens duly registered to come out with their PVCs to cast their votes for their preferred candidates and political parties.”
