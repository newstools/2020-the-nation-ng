A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr. Segun Sowunmi, has said the party has not foreclosed talks with former governor Dr. Olusegun Mimiko for the purpose of winning the October 10 governorship election. This is despite repeated denials by the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) in Ondo State that there was no alliance talk with the PDP. Sowunmi, a former spokesman for the Atiku Campaign Organisation, spoke in Akure, the Ondo State capital. He said PDP leaders were still mounting pressure on Mimiko to collapse the ZLP structure into the PDP with a view to defeating Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of the All Progressives Congress (APC) at the polls. The PDP chieftain noted that Mimiko remained a key factor in ensuring the collapse of the ZLP structures into PDP and supporting Eyitayo Jegede. He said Jegede would not depart from the vision Mimiko had been driving. Sowunmi warned that the Ajayi candidature would be dangerous, as he (Ajayi) was desperate about ruling the state. ”Ajayi cannot be trusted. Even when they gave him the second seat, as governor in waiting for Akeredolu, he made life difficult for him and couldn’t have the decency and dignity of resigning his appointment when he chose to jump ship. He carried their mandate up and down in the market, negotiating for what is not lost. “When we gave him a big reception in a big party like the PDP that did not satisfy him. Can every man insist that every time he goes out for election he must win?  Or he will tell the world that he’s not from Ondo State if he loses this election? There is a limit to how you must scheme, for indeed God Almighty is the best of schemers.” On Mimiko he said: ”We are not foreclosing alliance with Mimiko. In fact we are still on it and we have been begging everybody that has any voice to help us beg Mimiko. He is too precious to PDP.”
