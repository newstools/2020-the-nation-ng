 Former governors Ayodele Fayose and Segun Oni of Ekiti State, two erstwhile sworn political enemies, are now jolly good political pals. The two are members of the same faction of the troubled opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Following Oni’s unexpected decision to support Fayose’s camp in its battle against Senator Biodun Olujimi’s group, the battle for control of the party rages on. Sentry has, however, discovered that the new found love between the two politicians who not too long ago battled themselves to a standstill, may soon collapse. Most observers watching the moves of both men, hold the same view. Sources say the new friendship may be more of a loose political alliance than true reconciliation. Tongues are wagging that Oni is befriending Fayose because he desires the PDP gubernatorial ticket for 2022. On the other hand, others are saying Osokomole has no plan to support his new friend’s gubernatorial aspiration. Those who foresee a short-lived friendship between them are citing Fayose’s statement when he announced the end of hostilities between him and Oni last August, as a clear indication of things to come. “Having formally received Engr. Segun Oni into the PDP at yesterday’s State Congress, henceforth, nobody should castigate, embarrass or undermine him (Oni) on any social media platforms associated with Osoko Political Family. However, this statement does not represent or amount to endorsement of Oni’s gubernatorial ambition,” Fayose had said publicly, to set the stage for another round of intrigues between the new friends. To matters more interesting, sources close to Oni insist he’s not about to drop his ambition any time soon.
