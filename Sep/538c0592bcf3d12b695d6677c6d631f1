 THE Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) on Monday declared that the country’s public universities are not ready to re-open despite the National Universities Commission (NUC) telling them to prepare for resumption according to COVID-19 safety protocols. The union has also questioned the non-remittance of check-off dues from members’ salaries under the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System (IPPIS) for about four months now. Addressing reporters at the mini campus of the Olabisi Onabanjo University (OOU), Ago-Iwoye, Ogun State, the Coordinator of the Lagos Zone of ASUU, Prof. Olusiji Sowande, warned that it would be “suicidal” for universities to resume in an environment devoid of facilities to observe safe physical and social distancing amid the pandemic. ASUU said no concrete steps had been taken by the governments in any of the nation’s public universities to safeguard the health of their members and students from the COVID – 19 pandemic should the universities resume as directed by NUC. Olusiji, who addressed reporters in company of branch chairmen from the zone – including Dr. Joel Okewale (OOU), Dr. Adebayo Oni (Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta), Isaac Oyewumi (Lagos University, Ojo), Tunji Ettu (Tai Solarin University of Education, TASUED, Ijagun) and Dele Ashiru of the University of Lagos, noted that hostels’ accommodation was inadequate for students. Regarding IPPIS deductions, Olusiji accused the Office of the Accountant-General for failing to remit deductions from salaries of members, who were forcefully enrolled on the platform despite the union’s protests against it. He said: “The numerous complaints and other observed gaps in payment through IPPIS only confirmed our suspicion that the platform is a mere business venture for some individuals, who are bent on milking the country dry.”
