Governorship candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Eyitayo Jegede, has promised to end clashes between farmers and herders in communities in Akure North local government. Jegede made the promise when he took his campaigns to communities such as Aiyede/Ogbese, Ilu Abo, Bolorunduro, Alayere and Eleyeowo. The PDP candidate stated that it was regrettable that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) did nothing to broker a lasting truce between herders and farmers across the state. He said the deplorable condition of roads linking the communities was worrisome and promised to construct befitting road networks as well as provide soft loans for them to procure farm inputs. “We know you all have been neglected, in the face of frequent clashes between herdsmen and farmers; if you vote for us, we will bring in a crisis-resolution mechanism that will make everybody happy. “We will also provide other social amenities such as pipe-borne water and health centres that are currently lacking in the areas.” At Sango Market, Jegede said he would relocate the market to a more conducive environment. According to him, “A cattle market is not supposed to be within the town, for hygienic reasons; hence, the need for its immediate relocation.” He urged them to come out en-masses and vote for the PDP. Youth coordinator at Sango Cattle Market, Alhaji Jiddah Mohammed, hailed Jegede’s plan to relocate the market. Alhaji Jiddah said it would end lingering crisis between farmers and cattle rearers, in which the former used to complain of incessant attacks on their farmlands.
