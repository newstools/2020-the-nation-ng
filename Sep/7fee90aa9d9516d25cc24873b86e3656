Barring any last minute changes, two candidates may emerge in the All Progressives Congress (APC) primaries for the senatorial by-election for Imo North Senatorial District which held on Thursday. They are Senators Ifeanyi Araraume and Chief Frank Ibezim. Two factions of the party held parallel primaries across the six local government areas in the district to produce candidates for the senatorial by-election. Though, the results were yet to be officially announced, it was gathered that a faction of the party loyal to Senator Rochas Okorocha held direct primaries and was on its way to producing Senator Ifeanyi Araraume as its candidate. The other faction, loyal to Governor Hope Uzodimma and the Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, is most likely to produce Frank Ibezim as its candidate. As of the time of filing this report, Araraume and Ibezim were leading in the direct primaries held at different centres in various wards by their respective factions. All eleven candidates were in the ballot for the parallel elections.
