Senate President Ahmad Lawan has said traditional rulers should be given specific roles in the Constitution for Nigeria to surmount its security challenges. Lawan said this yesterday in Abuja when he hosted a delegation from the Emir Argungu in Kebbi State. “Traditional fathers have always been supportive of government. In fact, in the past, for those of us from the northern part of the country, the traditional leadership played a key stabilising role in administration. “Before 1976, when local governments were created, the traditional leaders brought both administration and management into focus, and we still need them. We need to have a proper role given to them, and more especially in the current security situation. “I’m sure that the traditional rulers can provide a lot of support for government and security agencies in fighting the challenges of insecurity that we have today,” Lawan said. Leader of the delegation, Alhaji Ibrahim Hassan (Kundudan Kabi), said the visit was at the instance of the Emir of Argungu, Alhaji Samaila Muhammad Mera, to thank Lawan for honouring the emirate’s invitation to attend the 2020 Argungu Fishing and Cultural Festival as a special guest. Hassan announced the conferment on the Senate President the traditional title of ‘Ganuwar Kabi’.
