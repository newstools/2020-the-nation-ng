 CROSS River State Governor Ben Ayade on Monday said that traffickers were  taking advantage of the high unemployment level in the nation to sell humans like commodities. Ayade said this while inaugurating the office and shelter of the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) in Calabar. The governor represented by the Secretary to the State Government (SSG),  Tina Agbor, noted that this was why he created an agency for Migration Control Services and provided NAPTIP with structures immediately they asked. He said that, although, some migrations were willful, others are not but the state government was trying its best to ensure that young people are gainfully employed to avoid being victims of trafficking.
