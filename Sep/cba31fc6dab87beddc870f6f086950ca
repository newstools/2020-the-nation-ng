A man who allegedly defrauded a Nigerian woman Mary Ope, 40, based in the United States of America has been taken into custody. Assistant Inspector-General of Police Iliyasu, who paraded Sylvester Ehiarinmian, 43, said he made love advances to Ope, who is married with children, promising to marry her. The lady naively fell into the suspectâ€™s scam net, police said. When Ope realised she was being scammed, she petitioned AIG Iliyasu, who men recovered four Sienna buses, a Toyota Highlander SUV and landed properties from the suspect. Ehiarinmian said, I did not defraud her. She is my girlfriend. We had a misunderstanding and she boasted that she had powerful people who would deal with me. Let us go to court , that is what I want. Police recovered from him a bunch of keys of a storey-building in Apo, Abuja.
