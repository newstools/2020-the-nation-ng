The Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has redeemed the N30million bounty he placed on a notorious criminal suspect popularly known in the underworld as Bobosky. Bobosky died at the Rivers police command in Port Harcourt shortly after he was captured by the police. Wike while presenting the cheque to the Commissioner of Police Mr. Joseph Mukan on Thursday said that he was elated that the police and members of the public worked assiduously to ensure the arrest of the suspect. The governor, who was represented by the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Dr. Tammy Danagogo, said that his government would continue to ensure the safety of all Rivers people. He said: “Governor Wike will continue to stand by his words, as this is not the first time such redemption is occurring in the state. If we can recall when the Governor made a promise over Don Wani, a criminal who disturbed the peace of ONELGA, all security agencies and citizenry were activated to capture him, and the pledge was also redeemed”. He thanked the Police and members of the public for their belief in Wike’s promise to reward all whistleblowers. “I thank the police officers for the gallantry in arresting the criminals and I also thank the informants who cannot be mentioned here”, he said. In his remarks, Mukan thanked the governor for fulfilling his promise stressing that it was not an easy task as the police murdered sleep and exhibited but professionalism throughout the operation, that led to the arrest of Bobosky. He said that the IGP Community Police Scheme was working well in information and intelligence gathering helping the police to reduce crime in the state. He assured the people of Rivers State that the Police would not relent in their duties promising to continue to partner with the public to wipe out all criminal elements in the state. He promised to capture the remaining members of the Bobosky gang, and also the so-called VIP and his gang terrorizing the Ahoada axis of the state.
