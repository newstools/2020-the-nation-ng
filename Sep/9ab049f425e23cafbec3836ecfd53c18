A lawyer in Ondo State, Mr. Femi Emmanuel Emodamori, has issued a seven-day ultimatum to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), to publish the particulars of Agboola Ajayi, governorship candidate of the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP). He said it would be in line with relevant provisions of the Nigerian constitution and provisions of Section 31 (2) & (3) of the Electoral Act, 2010 (as amended). This was contained in a letter to the INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmoud Yakubu, dated September 1. Emodamori said: “It will enable me and any other Nigerian who so desires to obtain a certified true copy of his particulars and institute an action in court to have Ajayi disqualified for having presented a forged certificate, as provided for in Section 31 (4), (5) and (6) of the Act. According to him, “in the unlikely event that INEC fails to comply with the above demand, I will immediately institute a mandamus action in court to compel INEC to perform its statutory duties in this regard. “I hope INEC will avoid the damning negative connotation and perception that such failure will engender among Nigerians and the international community, as well as civil societies and other stakeholders/observers assiduously working with INEC to deliver a credible governorship election in Ondo State.” But spokesman for the ZLP, Felix Olatunde, said the party was aware of the attempt to create doubt in the minds of its members and Ondo voters concerning Ajayi. He said Emodamori was acting on the prodding of some political adventurers.
