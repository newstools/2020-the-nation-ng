By Sampson Unamka Kiddwaya, Prince, Ozo and Dorathy have been put up for eviction this Sunday. However organizers of the show decided to go back to the previous way of nominating Housemates who would be up for eviction. Biggie, after the Arena Games on Monday, called the Housemates individually into the diary room to nominate those they wanted up for possible eviction. Prince, Kiddwaya, Ozo and Dorathy got the highest nominations after the session.  This is how the Housemates voted:  Kiddwaya- Vee, Prince  Nengi – Dorathy, Prince  Trikytee- Prince, Kiddwaya  Dorathy – Kiddwaya, Neo  Laycon- Ozo, Dorathy  Ozo- Prince, Kiddwaya
