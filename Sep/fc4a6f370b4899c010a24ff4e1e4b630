The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate, Mr. Eyitayo Jegede (SAN), has expressed joy about the victory of Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State in Saturday’s governorship election. He said in a statement in Akure that the result of the election was a manifestation of the people’s conviction that the PDP was the credible alternative that could give good governance to the people. “I express joy at the victory of Governor Obaseki, particularly for the fact that it symbolised Nigerians’ disenchantment with the ensuing poor leadership under the All Progressives Congress (APC) and their conviction that a PDP government is the credible alternative,” Jegede said. He said PDP is a party that institutionalises inclusive democracy, which gives equal opportunities to party members, as against the dominance of a cabal of political godfathers. Nigeria’s foremost ace sports journalist and Executive Chairman of Owan West Council, Frank Ilaboya, has congratulated Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki and his deputy, Philip Shaibu, on their victory at the just concluded governorship election. In a statement signed by the council chairman and made available to reporters by his Chief Press Secretary, Hassan Otinau, Ilaboya hailed the governor for his administrative acumen, “which has stood Edo State and its people out in the past four years.” He said: “I want to specially say congratulations to the man who God has destined to win and govern Edo State for the next four years. “It was one of the longest and toughest electioneering campaigns ever in the history of Edo politics, but thank God for giving us victory, a well-deserved one for that matter. “Edo people spoke loudly and clearly that we are a collection of people whose voices and must be respected at a decisive moment like this. “It was a battle between godfather and the good people of the state, a battle of light over darkness, and as always, the voice of the people remains the voice of God.”
