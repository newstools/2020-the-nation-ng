With barely four days to the kick-off the new Premier League season, analyst attempting to see tomorrow say Super Eagles defender Wilfred Ndidi will remain a torn on the flesh of opponents within the season. Ndidi who has successfully made himself a must play at the King Power Stadium has made over 120 appearances for the foxes since joining them in 2017 from Genk and has continued to improve with each game and with every season. Analyst x-raying player’s performance and club chances ahead of the kickoff noted that Leicester who parade Ndidi and compatriot Kelechi Iheanacho put up a good show last season despite failing to earn a top-four finish. The foxes they predicted will attempt to up their game in the new season while giving Ndidi a pat on the back for impressive defensive clearance within the period under review. The Nigerian took the lion share of tackles blocking what should have resulted in a huge migraine for the foxes. “Leicester also attempted a league-topping 742 tackles, with Wilfred Ndidi (129) and Ricardo Pereira (118) leading the way. A graphic representation shows how the Foxes are particularly good at snuffing out danger down their defensive flanks” was the verdict of Sky sports analysts, Wednesday. Leicester City manager, Brendan Rodgers had shortly after the end of last season, urged his wards to look towards the new season with renewed desire and determination. With the coach and the players on the same page, analysts say signs of battle to the finish is assured in the 2020/21 season which kicks off on Saturday, September 12. The foxes begin their new season campaign away to West Brom on Sunday with Ndidi who has made over 36 appearances for the Super Eagles expected to feature prominently.
