Leaders and members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers have thrown their weight behind efforts of the acting Chairman, Igo Aguma, to restructure the party in the state. The party supporters under the auspices of Freedom House (FH), a think-tank registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC), said Aguma had taken steps in the right direction to rebrand, rebuild and reposition APC for optimum performance in the state. The Director, FH, Worgu Boms, commended Aguma for his directive that all factional secretariats of the APC in the state should be shut down immediately to facilitate the resolution of issues hampering the progress of the APC. Boms, in a statement in Port Harcourt, said party leaders and members in FH would work with sincere seekers of peace to actualise the mandate of the acting Chairman especially his directive on factional secretariats. Boms said: “In particular, we commend the Acting Chairman’s directive that all factional secretariats in the state be shut down without further delay to make way for a neutral venue for mutual engagements to ensure a possible resolution of the two years’ seemingly intractable but clearly avoidable political stalemate in the party. “To this end, Freedom House shall collaborate and work in harmony with all sincere seekers of peace for the actualization of the mandate of the Acting Chairman, especially with respect to complying with the directive on the issue of shutting down of factional secretariats as no useful peace initiative can take place in a sectional secretariat or compromised environment. “We hereby passionately call on all genuine members of the party in the state, not to see any individual or sectional group as the face of the party, no matter how politically connected or financially benevolent they may represent themselves. “But rather, all should work towards an all-inclusive APC Rivers where every party member is regarded as a worthy member regardless of their political persuasion or economic status. After all, it is one man; one vote, irrespective of any other considerations”.
