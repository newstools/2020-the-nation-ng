Bad governance, unemployment, inadequate basic infrastructure, corruption and corrupt practices of government officials among others have been identified as some of the several causes of insecurity in the country. Oliseh Kadishi, a historian and researcher stated while speaking at the day two of Maroon Square Discourse 2020, an online conference tagged: ‘Struggle of women in Nigeria through history: women’s rights and challenge of insecurity in Nigeria’,  organized by Maroon Square and supported by Ross Luxemburg Foundation.’ Other causes according to her include poverty perceived victimization, ethnic superiority, religious superiority, materialism and the display of it with impunity. Kadishi also stated that the state of insecurity in Nigeria has metamorphosed and has been perceived to have assumed more complex dimensions especially in 2002 when Boko Haram came into the scene.  She said inadequate basic infrastructure is evident as some areas of the country have been neglected and people suffered over the years in terms of infrastructure and widening social inequalities, adding that this situation is crucial in explaining the regular eruption of protests and crises in the Niger Delta. Speaking further she said the presence of insecurity and conflict in Nigeria has affected women drastically as women pay heavily and remain susceptible to its heinous effects, especially as they   suffer gender-based violence during this time. Also, Temitope Fagunwa, Department of History and International Studies, Osun State University Osogbo, Osun state in his presentation said women and children bear the brunt of conflicts and insecurity that most conflicts in history ended with more women and children casualties. He said the Boko Haram insurgency has indeed affected women in a multi-dimensional way and that this crisis has literally precluded women in their numbers from having access to education, social benefits, healthcare services, wage labour among others.
