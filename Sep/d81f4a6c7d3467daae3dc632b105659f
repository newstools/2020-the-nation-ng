Borno State Governor Babagana Zulum and the Federal Commissioner, National Commission for Refugees, Migrants and Internally Displaced Persons (NCFRMI), Senator Basheer Mohammed visited the Niger Republic over the weekend. The visit was part of the advanced plan by the Commission and the state government to access the situation of stranded Nigerian Refugees in Niger and arrange for their return and integration.  Speaking to the refugees in Diffa, Senator Mohammed said the visit was long overdue and he wished he could have gone earlier. He thanked Governor Zulum for engaging the Commission in such an important fact-finding trip. “President Muhammadu Buhari has given directives to the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management & Social Development and her agencies to commit to prioritising Niger, Chad and Cameroon, through safe and orderly return”.
