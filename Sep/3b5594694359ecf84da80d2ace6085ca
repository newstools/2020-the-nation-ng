The Badagry Local Government witnessed a landmark achievement during the week with the foundation laying stone for the construction of a 170million naira two-storey administrative block of the council. Performing the groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of the building at the council secretariat, the chairman of the local government, Hon. Olusegun Onilude said his administration was re-writing the history of the local government with the construction of the administrative building 46 years after the last administrative block was built in the council secretariat. He said the construction of the new building was inevitable as most of the buildings at the council secretariat had become obsolete.  “It is imperative for our administration to fulfil our campaign promises by giving our secretariat a facelift in terms of structures for the comfort of workers of the local government, hence the groundbreaking of the two-storey administrative block. “Consequent upon this, there is the need for us in Badagry to move with time. It is no gainsaying the fact that the structures we have on ground at the secretariat have become obsolete. We need to upgrade the existing structures last built almost 46 years ago in the council secretariat and build a new ultra-modern administrative block with the state of the art facilities, ” he said. Onilude pointed out that the construction of the project, which is expected to be completed within 18 months, would have other features in the environment such as the shopping mall and recreation facilities. The climax of the occasion was the distribution of 50,000 naira each to 22 traders, artisans and widows as empowerment.
