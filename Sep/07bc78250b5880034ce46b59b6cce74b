Nigerian Afro-Dancehall star, Patoranking has expressed his desire to win some awards in a recent interview. The ‘Abule’ singer said, “There are so many awards to be won which makes the whole business fun you know, I will love to win a grammy, I will love to have an Oscar, I will love to have it the same way I have other awards in my shelf but truth be told I just think the reward is in heaven for me that is why I make music”. Patoranking also gave a hint on the meaning of his latest hit banger ‘Abule,’ he said, “Abule means village you know, but for us here in Lagos we termed Abule as a hood, area, ghetto, yeah like my abule is Surulere, so this song is me trying to talk about, my environment actually influences me you know, I’m highly influenced by where I come from which is the slum, and everything I make before I make music I just have a reflection of where I come from and that is how I write music and I say okay this time let me even talk about the parties, how the parties in the hood, what happens in the parties and all those things” said Patoranking. Patoranking’s latest 12 track album Three explores themes of life, love, and joy with Sauti Sol, Tiwa Savage among others adding their own regional flair.
