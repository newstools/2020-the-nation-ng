Members of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria, also known as Shiites, on Thursday said they were facing unwarranted harassment from security agents. The Shiites, who are followers of Sheikh Ibrahim El-Zakzaky, vowed that nothing will deter them from the continuous procession, in spite of the harassment. “We are a peaceful group, we will continue to carry out our religious rites, no matter what,” leader of the sect in Kano, Sanusi Abdulkadir, said. He said the sect will drill a borehole to Fagge Juma’at mosque, the biggest mosque in Kano State, popularly known as Masallacin Waje, located in Fagge Local Government area. The borehole is to have 30,000 litre tanks and a pumping machine. Abdulkadir said the gesture was to provide increased water supply to followers who worship at the mosque. He noted that the sect had ventured into philanthropic activities for a long time, adding “we (Shiites) will continue to help humanity forever.” The group leader disclosed that the funds for the construction of the borehole were already set aside. “We are only waiting for management of the mosque to show us a location where the project would be sited,” he said. “The water project is part of the philanthropic gestures carried out by Sheikh Zakzaky, who enjoined us to emulate him in order to earn Allah’s love and rewards.” A younger brother to Sheikh Zakzaky, Sayyid Badamasi Yakubu, who thanked the sect for the gesture, lamented how members of the movement are being arrested and allegedly killed for practicing their religious beliefs. “Members of the Shi’ah group are peace-loving and law-abiding, but they face harassment from the government when they practice their religion. “We will continue with our Ashura procession no matter what. We will not be deterred from any forces because we believe we are doing it for Allah and his messenger,” he said.
