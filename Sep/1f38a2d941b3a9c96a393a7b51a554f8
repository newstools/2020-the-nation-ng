The Oyo State Police Command and Oodua Peopleâ€™s Congress (OPC) are laying claim to launching an onslaught on suspected bandits in a section of the forest reserve in Oke-Ogun area of the state, which led to the arrest of some suspects. OPC leader Aare Gani Adams last week alerted the world that some terrorists have occupied the forest in Kisi, a town in Oke-Ogun, adding that the criminals were attacking and kidnapping residents. His announcement was confirmed by Kisi residents, which made security operatives and unconventional local security personnel to take a decision on how to rid the forest of criminals. In a statement on Monday, however, both the police command and OPC claimed that they launched an onslaught against the bandits Sunday evening, saying some of them were arrested with arms and ammunition. In a statement, the OPC said its members gained entrance into the Oyo National Park and confronted the bandits, claiming that it apprehended five of them with arms and ammunition. The statement by its Oyo State Coordinator, Mr Rotimi Olumo, said OPC members moved into the park following the alert by Aare Gani Adams.
