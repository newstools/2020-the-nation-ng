Some commuters in Ibadan metropolis have alleged that many drivers were not complying with COVID-19 pandemic safety protocols. They stated this in separate interviews with the News Agency of Nigeria in Ibadan yesterday. This is coming weeks after the Oyo State Government Containment Team held stakeholders meeting with the leaders of commercial drivers in the state to adhere to the protocol. But commuters insist that commercial drivers are carrying two passengers in the front seat and three passengers at the back seat of a cab without observing social distancing measures. Mr. Ayoola Ali, a passenger, told NAN that for a slight hike in transport fare, “commercial drivers do not adhere to safety protocols and most passengers seem not to care”. Mrs. Grace Afonja, another commuter, said most commercial vehicle drivers in Oyo State would not observe COVID-19 guidelines. Mr. Femi Olaleye added that since drivers had decided not to follow the guidelines for safety during COVID-19 pandemic, he had chosen to move by commercial motorcycles.
