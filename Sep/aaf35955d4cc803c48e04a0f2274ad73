Leaders of the African Democratic Congress (ADC) in Ondo West and East Federal constituency have collapsed the party’s structure into the All Progressives Congress (APC) ahead of the October 10, governorship election. The ADC leaders were led by Wale Akinlosotu including all its 22 Ward Chairmen and 54 local government executive members in Ondo West and East. They collapsed the ADC structure at an APC campaign rally held in Ondo town. Speaking at the rally, Akinlosotu said they decided to collapse the ADC into the APC for the smooth re-election of Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu. Akinlosotu who described Akeredolu as a performer said Ondo East and Ondo West would give him over 85 percent votes. Ondo APC chairman, Engr. Ade Adetimehin, who received the defectors, stated that out of the three political parties in Ondo town, two have joined forces with the ruling party. “There are three political parties in Ondo town. The APC, ADC, and ZLP. But today, ADC is declaring support for the APC. We are one. This shows that no one can beat the APC in Ondo town.” On his part, Governor Akeredolu said the continuous support of the people for the APC was an assurance of victory. Members of the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) led by Boro and a retired Permanent Secretary, Adeyemi Adelakun joined the APC at the event.
