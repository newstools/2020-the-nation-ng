 ELO Noro Edward aka El-Noro, a Sociology undergraduate of the Plateau State University has revealed her reasons for delving into the music industry. The Gospel act explains that she employs the Afro High Life genre of music to pass messages of salvation across the world.

On her favourite artist, El – Noro picked Mercy Chinwo saying she’s a soulful and highly gifted inspirational and gospel singer.
