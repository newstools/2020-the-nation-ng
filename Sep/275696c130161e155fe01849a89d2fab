 TRAVELLERS coming into the country without the mandatory COVID-19 test certificate will be slammed with sanction. The Federal Government said Nigerians in this category will be given six month passport suspension while non-indigene will have their visas cancelled. The Presidential TaskForce on COVID-19 National Coordinator, Dr.  Sani Aliyu, stated this on Monday. Nigeria joined the rest of the world to place travel bans as part of the global lockdown measures to contain the spread of the pandemic in March. The airspace has since been reopened for local and international flights, since September 5. Aliyu, who threw more light to the travel protocols, said: “Just to make it clear, it is mandatory that you have the PCR test done on day seven. When you arrive in the county (Nigeria) and for whatever reason you do not have a card that works on the system, and you are unable to pay at the airports, you will still have to make arrangment to pay before day seven of your test. “If you do not have a test by day 14th regardless whether you have paid or not, we have a system for identifying cases with Nigerian passports and restrictions will be placed on those passports for six months period. “For those that are non-Nigerians that have not had the PCR test done between the 7th and 14th days and on their way out of the country, we will revoke their visas. “There are clearly implications for not following the travel protocols and this is done in the interest of our country”. He also said that the country has list of accredited laboratories in countries where Covid-19 test have been disputed. Aliyu said only PCR test alone will be acceptable for boarding, which must be carties out at most 96 hours to boarding. He said over 9,000 passengers have entered into the country since the airspace was reopened for international flight. He also urged prospective passengers to make use of the portal designed for the purpose.
