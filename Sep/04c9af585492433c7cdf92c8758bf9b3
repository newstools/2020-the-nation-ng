 Ebonyi State government on Friday debunked reports that it was planning to write the Basic Education Certificate Examination questions on blackboards instead of the usual question papers. Commissioner for Education, Onyebuchi Chima, stated this during a meeting with principals of junior secondary schools in the state in Abakaliki, the state capital. He was reacting to reports in some national dailies (not The Nation) which claimed that Ebonyi State Government  had directed that BECE, popularly known as ‘Junior WAEC”  examination questions  are to be written on the  blackboard  with ‘chalks’ and ‘markers’ instead of standard  typed question papers. The commissioner maintained that at no time did the state government contemplate using such outdated method to conduct the examination and wondered where the reports emanated from. He assured students that the exam which is scheduled to commence on Monday 21st September 2020, would follow the standard used in previous years. He also debunked reports in the said reports that the ministry of education had collected registration fees ranging between N30,000 – N500,000 from private schools to register their students for 2020 BECE. According to him, “the assertion is highly capricious, a blatant and malicious  attempt to  deface the good reputation of Ebonyi State Ministry of Education.” The Commissioner noted that the examination would have been written earlier in the year but  was disrupted by the COVID-19  global pandemic
