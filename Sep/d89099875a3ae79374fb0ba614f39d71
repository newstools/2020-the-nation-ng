 YOUTHS of Kpakungun in Minna, Niger State on Monday blocked one of the major roads in the capital city as they protested lack of constant power supply. The youths chased away the Secretary to the Niger State Government (SSG), Ahmed Matane, who came to appeal to the youths, insisting on the presence of Governor Abubakar Bello. They said they were tired of the epileptic power supply, adding that the Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) was taking the people for granted,which according to them, was unacceptable. The Kpakungun road is the only route which leads to the southern part of the country and one of the most used toads. Motorists, especially those travelling to the south were stranded. Most of the motorists had to get alternative routes to prevent being caught up in the protests. The protests which began at 7 am saw several youths carrying placards that read: “Enough is Enough”, “No to Estimated Billing”, “No to 2 hours of Light”, “If AEDC cannot give us light, they should pack and go”, “we no go gree” among others.
