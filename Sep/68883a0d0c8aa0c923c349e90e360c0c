Empowerment of women is important for the country to achieve sustainable development, PZ Wilmar said at the weekend in Lagos. Its Marketing Manager, Chioma Mbanugo, who spoke during the virtual Mamador August Women Meeting, said the firm will continue to support women as critical stakeholders in the national economy. The meeting is a women gathering recognised among the Igbo community as the yearly homecoming congress. She said: “Understanding the importance and significance of the August Women Meeting, not just the cultural aspect, we felt it was necessary to host an online version. Times are fast changing; we now live in a world where distance shouldn’t be a barrier to our collective growth and development. This August Women Meeting has always provided women with the opportunity to gather and foster community growth and development, as well as support each other whichever way they can. “That is why I am very delighted that we have been able to achieve likewise with our first ever Mamador August Women Meeting.”
