 BAYELSA State Governor Douye Diri has said People’s Democratic Party (PDP) carefully picked its candidates for the October 31 Bayelsa Central and West senatorial by-elections. Diri spoke at the weekend after the primaries, which produced his predecessor, Seriake Dickson, and former party chairman Moses Cleopas, as candidates for Bayelsa West and Central. A statement on Sunday by Diri’s Acting Chief Press Secretary Daniel Alabrah said the governor hailed the peaceful primaries. The governor was satisfied with the process, and praised the aspirants and delegates for being orderly. He urged party members to work for the success of its candidates in the by-elections. “The primary was orderly, transparent and fair. I am very sure that everybody is satisfied with the conduct. “You will also agree with me that we carefully selected and nominated our candidates. “We are presenting our best in the election. The former governor is experienced in legislative and executive matters; he is also a lawyer. “Our former chairman is a good party man with oratory power and great leadership skill. They will be good representatives in the Senate and strong voices for Bayelsa and the Ijaw nation. I urge our people to support these great men in the election.” Dickson said he had no power outside God in his political career. A statement by his media aide, Fidelis Soriwei, said Dickson spoke yesterday at a thanksgiving service at his country home of Toru-Orua. Dickson stressed that God strengthened him and fought the political battles he won as governor and before then. According to him, God himself, as chief justice of the Supreme Court of the Universe, used his court to deliver the verdict, which stopped All Progressives Congress (APC) from taking over the state.
