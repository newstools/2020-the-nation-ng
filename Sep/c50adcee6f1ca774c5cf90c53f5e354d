  A CHIEFTAIN of All Progressives Congress (APC) Uche Nwosu has praised President Muhammadu Buhari for remodelling Enugu International Airport. Nwosu, a governorship candidate in Imo State, said with the upgrade, second Niger Bridge and proposed Enugu/Aba/Port Harcourt rail, Buhari had justified the mandate Igbo gave him. He noted that with the airport operational, Southeast would be opened to commercial activities to impact its economy. Nwosu urged the Igbo to support and partner Buhari to identify ‘our areas of need that should be addressed’. He said: “With the completion of these projects, President Buhari has shown that he is committed to infrastructural development in Southeast. It is not just about appointment. My appointment, for instance, or that of any other person, can’t meet the challenges in the zone; and once it does not put food on the table of the common man, it means nothing. “You can have 100 people appointed into government from one zone and they don’t have roads, airport, bridges; their schools are not constructed, so what then is the benefit of the appointments? The appointment I cherish is infrastructure development. If President Muhummadu Buhari has built the second Niger Bridge, if he has transformed the Enugu airport, if he has done the Port Harcourt-Owerri road, the Owerri-Aba road, then it is the best appointment, that is the kind of appointment I expect, not the appointment that will bring nothing to the zone.”
