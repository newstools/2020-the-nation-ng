The Oba of Benin, Ewuare II, has called for full protection of corps members that will participate in the September 19 governorship election in Edo State. He made the call in his palace Thursday in Benin, when the Director-General of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Brig.-Gen. Shuaibu Ibrahim, visited him. Oba Ewuare II stressed that the corps members must be adequately protected, in view of the desperation of some politicians, who would want to win the election at all costs. The first-class monarch noted that the concept of the NYSC to foster national unity and understanding must be upheld. Oba of Benin also pointed out that the palace’s authorities were doing everything within their powers to ensure safety of corps members in Edo state, before during and after the crucial poll. The Director-General of NYSC, earlier in his remarks, declared that the corps members should not take sides, but they must discharge their patriotic duties to their fatherland, in order to move Nigeria forward. Ibrahim disclosed that NYSC was closely working with the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19, ahead of the nationwide orientation camps’ opening for fresh corps members, for the exercise to be pandemic free.
