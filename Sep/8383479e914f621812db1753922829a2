 The Association of Master Bakers in the Southwest has threatened to suspend production of bread across the length and breadth of the states due to high cost of materials used. According to the Southwest chairman of the association, Alhaji Abolusodun Salawu and the Lagos chairman, Ambassador Raji  Omotunde,  ”the last time we increased the price of bread was in the year 2016, but today prices of baking materials have gone up astronomical.” They revealed that, “since March this year, the price of flour keeps increasing on monthly basis and they are planning for another increase on the 1st of October.  “We cannot continue to run our business at a loss. Each time we talked about the cost of flour, sugar, butter, e.t.c. The producers of these products always complain that they do not get foreign exchange directly from the Federal government hence they are forced to buy dollars in the black market. We, therefore appeal to the government to come to our aid before we finally down tools”, they said.
