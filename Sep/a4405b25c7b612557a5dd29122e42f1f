The Super Eagles are one of the biggest movers as the monthly FIFA Rankings were released yesterday  after six months hiatus with the coach Gernot  Rohr’s side listed in third position in Africa. Senegal held on to its top rating in the continent as the AFCON 2019 runner’s up maintained its status as the 20th rated team in the world and number one in Africa. Tunisia also moved up by one step to be ranked 26th in the ranking and second best team in Africa while the Super Eagles moved two steps up to be ranked 29th best team in the world and the third best in Africa. The Super Eagles who are expected to resume duty when they host Cote d’Ivoire and Tunisia next month in Austria, is among the three teams that move by two steps up in the latest ranking alongside Portugal and Wales. While there has been no movement among the leading quartet – in descending order: Belgium, France, Brazil and England – Portugal (5th, up 2) have moved into the top five thanks to victories over Croatia (8th, down 2) and Sweden (18th, down 1).
