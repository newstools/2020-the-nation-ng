 Regina Daniels resumed lawn tennis training barely three months after giving birth to her first son and child with hubby, Ned Nwoko. The Nollywood actress made her first appearance on the lawn tennis court a few weeks back and she has since been regular at training. Regina picked up an interest in lawn tennis after her marriage to Nwoko, who is also a lover of the sport. The popular actress revealed in a 2019 interview that she was drawn into the sport because of her hubby’s passion for sports – especially lawn tennis and swimming.  The actress and producer had revealed how her husband taught her how to play lawn tennis and swim in the spate of 24-hours. Complimenting her return to the lawn tennis court, she said, “I am getting so good at tennis and my body is really cooperating with me.” However, it is unsure if Regina has returned to filming movies after the birth of her first son and child. Regina currently shuttles between Abuja and Delta state as one of the wives of ex-lawmaker and billionaire, Ned Nwoko.
