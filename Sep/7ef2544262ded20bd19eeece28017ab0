Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq said on Monday that over 1,000 schools need reconstruction and equipment with modern teaching facilities across the 16 local governments. He said his administration has activated plans to gradually fix the facilities, equip them, train and motivate teachers to guarantee quality basic education. “We have over 1,000 schools which need to be rebuilt. It is not just about renovation because many of the classrooms have collapsed. Some don’t even have floor, let alone furniture. So, we will gradually fix these schools and bring them back,” AbdulRazaq told participants at the last lap of the citizens’ engagement on the 2021 budget held at Ajase-Ipo, Kwara South. The Executive Council last Friday approved for the state to take a N7.1billion facility to access (another N7.1billion of) the six-year backlog of outstanding Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) funds, which the state plans to invest in its basic education sector.
