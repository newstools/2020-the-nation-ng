Councillors in Obi local government area of Nasarawa have impeached chairman of the council, Hon Mohammed Iyimoga, over alleged financial misconducts. The legislators accused the chairman of not briefing the House about revenues and executing projects not captured in the budget. They further alleged the chairman of not presenting 2020 budget and consistently mobilising thugs to disrupt their sittings. Speaker of the Legislative Council Hon Luka Isiah confirmed the development to The Nation. He said the chairman has been running the office as a sole administrator. “Out of 10 councillors in the LG, 8 signed for the impeachment of the chairman,” he said One of the councillors, Hon Matthew Odunaga, said: “I am the councillor representing Obi ward, we come from the same ward with the local council chairman. “We have many complaints of alleged breach of constitutional violations against the embattled chairman, Hon Iyimoga. “The constitution provides that he has to consult the legislature for any expenditure above N500,000 but he has not. “He did not present the budget for 2020 and the year is ending, he hide the mace whenever we were about to sit among many other allegations. But the embattled chairman told The Nation he only received the impeachment notice and remains the council chairman as far as he was concerned. About two dozen police and NSCDC personnel have taken over the Council Secretariat.
