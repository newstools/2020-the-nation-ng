 A HIGH Court in Benin on Monday admitted the Iyatsere of Warri, Johnson Atseleghe, to N2 million bail after being charged with murder. Justice Efe Ikponmwoba also ordered the defendant to produce one surety in like sum, who must own a property with a Certificate of Occupancy. The judge held that the courtâ€™s decision to grant the defendant bail arose from the absence of facilities to manage his diabetes, hypertension and cataract ailments in police custody. The judge ordered that the defendant be available to face trial as averred in his affidavit in support of the motion for bail. The defendant and 11 others were charged with conspiracy, kidnap and murder. They were alleged to have murdered Sunny Etchie, the Okhaigele (youth leader) of Kolokolo community in Edo. The defendants pleaded not guilty to the charges.
