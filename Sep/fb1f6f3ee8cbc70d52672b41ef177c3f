Current Head of House, Erica has shared her experience sleeping on the same bed with her deputy, Prince. Erica, who would have chosen Kiddwaya as deputy, had to look elsewhere due to Kiddwaya’s suspension. During her diary session, Erica told Biggie how she struggles to be on the same bed with Prince. She said they just lie down without having any conversation, a situation that would never happen with Kiddwaya. “Another struggle for me as Head of House is for me to sleep in the same bed with Prince instead of Kidd. “On a normal day, me and Prince, we get along but sleeping in the same bed is awkward. “Like when we get into the HoH room and when he lies next to me, we won’t have anything to talk about. “Before I and Prince used to have conversations but just because we sleep in the same bed, it’s now awkward,” she lamented.
