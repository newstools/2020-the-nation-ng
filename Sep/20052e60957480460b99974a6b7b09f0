Three persons were feared dead and many wounded when a patrol team of military and police officials raided communities in Andoni council area of Rivers State. It was gathered that the operatives were accompanied by a local security outfit, the Andoni Security Peace and Advisory Council. They reportedly stormed the communities on gun boats when residents were said to be preparing for church service. Sources said the security team was on the hunt for  miscreants, adding that their primary target fled on sighting them. President-General of the Obolo Youths Coalition, Ijaonama Mkpon Amon confirmed that the three persons who died were from his community, Ajakajak, while two others sustained serious injuries in Ibot-Irem community. Mkpon condemned the invasion, saying that the security operatives should go after their target rather than killing innocent persons. He said, “If you are coming to raid a community, it should be on target not a zigzag raiding. The three persons who died are from Ajakajak, my community. “I call on the Inspector General of Police and the Chief of Army Staff to intervene and investigate this incident.” Spokesman of 6 Division, Nigerian Army, Major Charles Ekeocha said the raid was not carried out  by soldiers from the division, adding that, probably, operatives from another division did.
