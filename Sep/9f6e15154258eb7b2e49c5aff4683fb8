A group of young entrepreneurs has donated items to Hope Fountain School for the Deaf to mark the birthday of Lagos House of Assembly member Rasheed Makinde, who represents Ifako/Ijaye 2 Constituency. The items include toiletries, detergents and food in support of the special school children. The group said the gesture was premised on the symbol of collective greatness, which Makinde epitomised, adding that his pursuit of what benefited all was unmatched. The leader of the group, Comrade Olatunde Kenneth, said the lawmaker had proved himself as the man of the people with his track records. “We have organised this as a surprise as he has always surprised us with opportunities within and outside our constituency. “This donation of food items, toiletries and cash was facilitated by the Makinde Formidable Ambassadors. “As a promising lawmaker we have a strong belief in his ideology and he has influenced our membership of the All Progressives Congress (APC). We have been following his footsteps, as loyal ambassadors. “We are donating this token to celebrate him, and pray for him to continue to wax stronger in wisdom, knowledge and understanding of his primary responsibility and the people,” he said. The lawmaker expressed his delight and thanked them for the honour. He said he received a lot of surprises on his birthday. “Everything is still appearing like a dream. I can’t say much than to continue giving God all glory and adoration and ask for more favour for my immediate and political families and more importantly, more victories for our party, the APC,” Makinde said. The Principal, Mr. Tony Wankolo, said: “We cannot but thank you for counting us worthy of your visitation. It is a great opportunity for the students, workers and management to see you. We wish you long life and prosperity in all your endeavours. “The gifts you have brought to us are well appreciated and we commend you to continue to do more for the people.”
