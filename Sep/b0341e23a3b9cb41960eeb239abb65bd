 THE United Kingdom chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has advised the electorate not to vote blindly during the coming governorship election slated for September 19. Mr. Ade Omole, leader of the chapter, gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja, while speaking about Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu’s SIMPLE agenda. He said Ize-Iyamu, the APC governorship candidate, meant well for Edo and its people judging from his SIMPLE agenda and manifesto. “I advise the electorate to get copies of his manifesto and study it ahead of the election to avoid voting blindly and wrongly too. “I have no doubt that Ize-Iyamu has been assigned by God to enthrone good governance and development in Edo at this point in time because I have studied his manifesto and his SIMPLE agenda.”
