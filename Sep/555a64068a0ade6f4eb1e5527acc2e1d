Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr said it would take some time before he could return to Nigeria following the resumption of most European leagues. The German had in May penned a new two-year contract extension with a proviso that he would be resident in Nigeria so as to monitor players from the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL). But the twin effects of COVID-19 pandemic and suspension of international football made his return doubtful. Speaking from his base in France, Rohr said the resumption of top European leagues would give him the chance to monitor the players in view of the upcoming Super Eagles international friendly matches with Cote d’Ivoire and Tunisia in October in Austria. “We are finishing with our list for the friendly matches,” Rohr told NationSport. “But I will watch some players in Europe before coming back to Nigeria; they are resuming playing everywhere in Europe very soon,” he added. While both the English Premier League and Spanish La Liga comes on stream this weekend, the Italian Serie A will start on September 19 with full compliments of key Super Eagles players including striker Victor Osimhen, a record signing for Napoli from Lille in July. There are pockets of Nigerian interests elsewhere following the transfer of Oghenekaro Etebo on Monday from Stoke City to Turkish giants Galatasaray. “Yes, he (Etebo) can come to competition again,” Rohr said of the Super Eagles midfielder who spent part of last season on loan from Stoke City to Getafe in the La Liga.
