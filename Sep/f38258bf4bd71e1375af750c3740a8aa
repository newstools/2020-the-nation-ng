The Lagos State Signage and Advertising Agency (LASAA) has announced various palliatives to cushion the adverse impact of the COVID-19 on the operations of outdoor advertising practitioners. Its Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer (MD/CEO) of LASAA, Prince Adedamola Docemo, stated this at a news conference in Lagos over the weekend. He said the agency has decided to waive the permit fees for outdoor practitioners spanning three months from April to June 2020, following the approval of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. “This represents 25 per cent of the outdoor practitioners’ bill for the year 2020,” he said. He added that the agency is also willing to offer a special discount to all outdoor advertising practitioners that are ready to offset their 2019 outstanding bills completely and immediately. “This will, however, be done on a case-by-case basis,” he said. Docemo explained that a revised bill for this year will be sent to all registered outdoor advertising practitioners with a letter detailing the terms and conditions attached to the rebate, adding that a major condition is the practitioners’ readiness to settle all 2019 outstanding bills as well as the outstanding payment for January to March 2020. The LASAA boss said a formal letter has been sent to the Outdoor Advertising Association of Nigeria (OAAN) and other stakeholders in the industry intimating them of the new developments. He expressed optimism that the initiative will go a long way to demonstrate the agency’s resolve to help the industry grow as well as cushion the negative effect of the pandemic on outdoor advertising business in the state. “We hope the members of the outdoor advertising industry will reciprocate this good gesture from the state by ensuring prompt payment of all their obligations to the agency as this will help the state’s agenda to achieve accelerated infrastructure development.” Docemo remarked that the palliatives have become imperative because the advertising sector and the economy at large had been badly hit by the advent of the coronavirus pandemic, particularly the outdoor advertising industry.
