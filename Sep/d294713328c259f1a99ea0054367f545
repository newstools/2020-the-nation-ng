Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde on Thursday urged the newly inaugurated State Independent Electoral Commission (OYSIEC) to conduct election into the councils within the shortest possible time. Makinde, who said the election must only be conducted into the 33 local governments recognised by the Constitution, added tht his administration had included funds for the conduct of the council poll in the budget. The governor said he does not want to be distracted by the 2023 general election by the Opposition, noting that he may or may not contest the poll. Makinde spoke at the Government House, Agodi, Ibadan while inaugurating an eight-man OYSIEC. The event was attended by top government functionaries and party chieftains. The electoral committee has Mr. Isiaka Olagunju as chairman, while Comrade Afeez Babatunde, Mrs. Ganiyat Saka, Mr. Olanrewaju Emmanuel, Chief Kunle Agboola, Mr. Remi Ayoade, Mr. Sunday Falana and Mr. Adeojo Elias are members. The governor, who said his administration had to take the tough and painful decision of appointing caretaker bosses in the councils following the vacuum created by the sack of the former chairmen, faulted the election conducted by the last administration. He said investigation showed that no candidate or party at the election paid the required and expected fees to the coffers of the electoral umpire. He urged the committee to conduct its affairs to the benefit of the people and to the glory of God. Olagunju said OYSIEC would conduct an election that would attract the participation of all the parties. While not ruling out the possibility of organising the election before the end of the year, he urged the people to trust the commission, promising that no party would be given any undue advantage against another in the conduct of the local government election.
