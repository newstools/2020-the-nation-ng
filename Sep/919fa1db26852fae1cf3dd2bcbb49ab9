 Special Adviser to Edo State Governor on Political Affairs Chief Osaro Idah has said the All Progressives Congress (APC) has crossed the line in its desperation to drag highly respected persons and institutions in the society in the mud over its low public rating. Idah, speaking in Benin City yesterday, said: “The royal palace of the Benin monarch has for decades remained insulated from partisan politics and political actors must respect its neutral status. “It is unfortunate that the APC will go to such extent in an attempt to dishonour our revered monarch and our traditional institution in the name of politics.  “It is also shameful that the APC will try to use a faceless group to try to tarnish the very cordial relationship between the palace and the government.” He added: “APC is swimming in troubled waters by dragging the highly exalted Royal Palace of the Omo N’ Oba N’ Edo, Uku Akpolokpolo, Ewuare II, into its brand of campaign of calumny and mudslinging.” “The issue between the Ogiamien family and the Benin Royal House predates the election of Governor Godwin Obaseki in 2016, and has been receiving attention by the relevant institutions of government, including the courts. “We are, however, assured that neither the good people of Edo State nor the revered Benin Royal Palace can be misled by this reckless and reprehensible tactic of the APC in the name of politics. APC’s attempt to pit the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led government against the Benin Monarch will continue to fail.”
