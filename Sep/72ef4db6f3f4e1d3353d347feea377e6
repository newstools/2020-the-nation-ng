 RAFAEL Nadal comfortably secured his place in the second round of the 2020 French Open after he brushed aside Egor Gerasimov in straight sets, 6-4 6-4 6-2, at Roland Garros. The Spaniard had been concerned about the cold conditions and slow balls in Paris in the lead up to his favourite Grand Slam, but he appeared happy enough as he won through.
