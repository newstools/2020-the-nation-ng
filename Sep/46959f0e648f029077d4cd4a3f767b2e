Doctors under the aegis of the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) have suspended their strike. NARD President, Aliyu Sokomba, confirmed this on Thursday evening. He stated the discussions with Federal Government on how to resolve the issues continues on Friday by 8 am. He said the doctors decided to embark on strike due to the failure of the government to meet their requests made in June. In June, the doctors downed tools over unpaid salaries, non-payment of hazard allowance and a dearth of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in hospitals, among several other reasons. The meeting between the two parties on Wednesday in Abuja ended in a deadlock with government threatening to revoke the residency programme.
