Twente right-back Tyronne Ebuehi is eager to return to the Nigeria national team after recovering from a career-threatening injury. The 24-year-old signed for Portuguese giants Benfica following his showings for the Super Eagles at the 2018 World Cup in Russia. The defender was one of the standout performers for Nigeria as they were eliminated in the group stage of the global tournament. Ebuehi, however, ruptured his cruciate knee ligaments in July 2018 and subsequently missed the whole of 2018-19 season. The former ADO Den Haag right-back was also not part of the Super Eagles team that finished third at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt. Ebuehi, who recently joined Twente on loan to reignite his career, has appreciated the support he received during his difficult period and now looks forward to re-joining his Super Eagles teammates. “I saw every game. It wasn’t easy for me. I always wanted to be with the team and play in my first Nations Cup,” Ebuehi BBC Sport. “For me, international breaks is always special, the friendships I’ve made and formed with the coaching and backroom staff, teammates and everyone in Nigeria. “I was very proud. I miss that a lot but life is life. I was happy to see them play the way they did, unfortunately, we didn’t win but I know better days will come for us and more success. I cannot wait to be a part of the team again. “I can’t thank the Nigerian fans enough. I don’t check my social media messages every day but once in a while I do and I see some amazing and incredible messages. “So many people praying and wishing me well despite being away for two years. I will continue to be grateful for the support I get.” Ebuehi explains he is now fully fit, raring to return to action and prove his worth for Twente in the Eredivisie.
