Governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Eyitayo Jegede has promised to end clashes between farmers and herders in communities in Akure North Local Government. He made the promise when he campaigned at Aiyede/Ogbese, Ilu Abo, Bolorunduro, Alayere and Eleyeowo communities. The PDP standard-bearer said it was regrettable that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) did nothing to broker a lasting truce between herders and farmers across the state. He said the deplorable condition of roads linking the communities was worrisome and promised to build befitting road networks as well as provide soft loans for farmers to procure agricultural implements. “We know you all have been neglected in the face of frequent clashes between herdsmen and farmers. If you vote for us, we will bring in a crisis-resolution mechanism that will make everybody happy. “We will also provide other social amenities such as pipe-borne water and health centres that are currently lacking in the areas.” At Sango Market, Jegede said he would relocate the market to a more conducive environment. He said: “A cattle market is not supposed to be within the town, for hygienic reasons; hence, the need for its immediate relocation.” The PDP candidate urged the people to come out en masses and vote for him. Youth coordinator at Sango Cattle Market Alhaji Jiddah Mohammed hailed Jegede’s plan to relocate the market. He said it would end crisis between farmers and cattle rearers.
