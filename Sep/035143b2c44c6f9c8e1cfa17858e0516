SOME students, who tested positive for COVID-19 while sitting for the ongoing 2020 West African Senior School Certificate Examination, have been discharged after testing negative, the Federal Government said on Monday. Minister of State for Education Emeka Nwajiuba, during a news conference by the Presidential Task Force on Covid-19 in Abuja on Monday, said the pupils, who have now tested negative, are back in class. About four pupils writing the WASSCE in Gombe tested positive for the virus while one case was reported in Kwara State. The minister said: “We have confirmed that all of them are back in class. They have now been tested, they have all been discharged. We do not have any further cases. “There were four in Gombe, there was one in Kwara and there was few in Bayelsa. But this morning (yesterday), on my way inspecting schools that are in exam classes, those of them have been discharged as they all tested negative. “We are still getting feedback from the field in case there are any new places where this may crop up.” Speaking on plans to reopen tertiary institutions, the minister said their preparedness (tertiary institutions) have been tabled before the task force. He said the task force will then put together the preparations and use it to issue a national guidance that tertiary institutions will use to reopen.
