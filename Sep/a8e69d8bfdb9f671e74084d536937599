The Oba of Kishi, Oba Moshood Lawal, has said efforts of local vigilante members, strengthened by security agencies, have started yielding results. They have confronted some people suspected to be terrorists hiding in the game forest. Fears were heightened on Wednesday when Aare Ona-Kakanfo Gani Adams raised an alarm on the presence of suspected terrorists in the forest located in the town, revealing that they were attacking and kidnapping residents, thereby throwing the town into panic and confusion. Although many people dismissed Adams’ claim, some residents of Kishi, a sleepy town in Oke-Ogun area of Oyo State, confirmed the development. They confirmed that no fewer than 11 men were kidnapped on Wednesday morning, sending jitters down the spines of residents and their relations globally. Oba Lawal, however, allayed the fears on Thursday when he disclosed that local vigilante and soldiers were already confronting the suspects, making them uncomfortable in their hideouts. He said although they engaged the criminals in crossfire, they were being overpowered. The monarch said the joint task force did not record any casualty during the crossfire. “There is no cause for fear. Our local vigilantes are wonderful and as I am speaking now, they have pushed them to Igboho route and some soldiers have joined the forces. Honestly, the bandits struck through Agboola farm, and after intensive crossfire they were forced out from that axis. No death causality from the side of our dwellers. We shall be on top of it. Necessary steps have equally been taken. We need to apply caution, not paint our ancestral home as land of terror to the outside world. We shall in-sha Allah be victorious on all internal and external aggressors,” Oba Lawal said.
