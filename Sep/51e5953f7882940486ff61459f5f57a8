The Federal Government has directed tertiary hospitals to engage the services of National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) members to maintain routine services in place of striking resident doctors. Minister of Health Dr Osagie Ehanire said the measure to “mitigate the effect” of the strike by resident doctors across the country. The National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) embarked on nationwide strike on Monday over non-payment of their COVID-19 hazard allowance and other demands. To address the absence of resident doctors as a result of the industrial action, Ehanire gave Federal Health institutions four guidelines to comply with. “COVID-19 treatment outlets should continue to function as before; emergency services should continue to run as before; routine services should be maintained with consultants, NYSC Doctors; locum staffers to be brought in when and where necessary to forestall services disruption when applicable and affordable,” the minister said. “I call on the NARD to return to work and engage the Federal Government in completing the ongoing due process of implementing the MoU between NARD and government. “I wish to assure the general public that measures have been put in place to ensure that they continue to access services at all our federal tertiary hospitals across the country,” he said.
