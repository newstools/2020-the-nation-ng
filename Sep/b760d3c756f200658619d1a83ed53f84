The Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) on Tuesday in Lagos destroyed substandard cables worth several millions of naira. The regulator also used the occasion to rate locally made cables higher in standards. The Director in-charge of Compliance and Inspectorate (SON), Obiora Manafa, who supervised the exercise, said the substandard cables were seized during SON’s operatives’raids on warehouses across the state. He explained that the absence of the SON from the ports and other critical points of entry into the country have confined the regulator to relying on only its intelligence network to apprehending importers or dealers in substandard products. “When we get information that a warehouse is keeping cables, we go there and carry out tests on the cables, if they fail the tests, we ceil the warehouse until we have evacuated the products to our warehouse for further tests and court order for destruction,” Manafa said. He reiterated the need for SON officials to be at the ports to ensure that such substandard and dangerous goods do not find their way into the country. “The substandard cables failed all physical tests, and did not meet the safety requirements of Nigeria and are not fire-resistant even in insulations,’’ he said. Mabafa said made-in-Nigeria cables are the best because the manufacturers adhere to standards.
