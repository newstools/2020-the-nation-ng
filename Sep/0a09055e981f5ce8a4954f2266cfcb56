The last two relationships in the House – Vee with Neo and Ozo with Nengi – seem to be back on track as week nine comes to an end. Just when many viewers thought all has gone wrong between the pairs, they seemed to find a way to settle their differences and clear the dust to move ahead to the final week. On day 62, Ozo and Nengi sorted their differences to forge ahead. While Housemates were gathered in the Garden in anticipation of a lit night, Nengi and Ozo decided to resolve some pending issues first. Nengi claimed Ozo was snubbing her while Ozo maintained she was the one giving him cold shoulders. After what seemed like a long settlement, they resolved their couple-related issue and ended up sharing a bowl of meal in the HoH Lounge before they joined others. Meanwhile, Neo and Vee served a couple of vibes on the same day. Neo and Vee are a regular pair on this table and day 62 lit party was no different as Neo kept leaving the jacuzzi to go steal some kisses from bae. A funny incident happened after their kissing session as Laycon brought to Neo’s attention what seemed to be a boner. Already, Vee, Neo, Nengi have secured a place in the final while Ozo battles to remain in the game for the finale with Laycon, Dorathy, and TrikyTee.
