Governorship candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) Eyitayo Jegede, has denied allegations that he planned disrupting the campaign flag off of the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP). The ZLP and its candidate, Agboola Ajayi, have scheduled its campaign flag off for Saturday at Ore, Odigbo local government but there were concerns that the rally might be disrupted. But Jegede who dissociated himself and the PDP from the plot said it was a prominent political party in the state that planned to storm ZLP campaign flag-off in PDP vests, Fez-caps, and his memorabilia. Jegede who spoke through Director General of his campaign organisation, Akin Adaramola said the ‘party in question has cloned and printed PDP T-shirts, fez- caps, and various items printed with our governorship candidate’s names and images which they would wear and decorate themselves with as a decoy while going on the heinous mission with a branded bus with the name of Eyitayo Jegede and his pictures. “We, therefore, dissociate our party, our candidate, Eyitayo Jegede, SAN and his running-mate, Hon. Ikengboju/Gboluga from this plot or any other one to attack or disrupt the ZLP campaign rally flag-off at Ore or anywhere else, now or thereafter. “They also plan to seize the opportunity to unleash an attack on billboards and posters of all the other 16 political parties participating in the election. “We also want to use this medium to alert all security agencies in the state to place those who are desirous of fomenting trouble under close watch with a view to preventing violence in the state before, during, and after the October 10, 2020, gubernatorial election.”
