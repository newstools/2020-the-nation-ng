DSTV and GOtv subscribers can look forward to the imminent return of La Liga action live on SuperSport. The first round of the 2020-21 season scheduled to be played from 11-14 September 2020. SuperSport, the home of football is the only platform that provides English commentary from the La Liga league. The 2020-21 La Liga season will open with a shortened round as clubs like Real Madrid, Barcelona, Atletico Madrid and Sevilla will be absent due to their participation in the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League’s recent mini tournaments. Despite Barcelona not being scheduled to play until much later in the month, they are the team dominating the headlines in La Liga over Lionel Messi transfer clause.  Barcelona have a presidential election looming and one of the main candidates, Victor Font, stated that the only way the six-time Ballon d’Or winner might remain at Camp Nou is if current president Josep Maria Bartomeu resigns. Asked if it is too late for Messi to change his mind, Font said: “That’s the way it seems. This is the best football club in the world and we will do everything to ensure that the association with Messi stays.” But SuperSport remains committed to providing DStv and GOtv Viewers the best sporting experience in the coming La Liga season, with best view of their favourite stars dominating La Liga pitches across Spain.
