 SUPER Eagles forward Josh Maja has been named by Germany-based French football podcast cavanisfriseur.de as the Ligue 1 player to watch for the 2020/21 season. The Bordeaux star scored his first goal for the season as Bordeaux claimed a 2-0 away win over Angers at the Stade Raymond Kopa last week. According to the podcast Bordeaux’s new coach Jean-Louis Gasset seems to have great confidence in Maja straight away, allowing him to start the two opening games of Ligue 1. Unlike many other young strikers who have a fast pace and a quick start, Maja’s strengths are not just being sent behind the opponent’s last line with good timing but he always finds smart positions in the penalty area and scores a large part of his goals with the first contact after a cross from a teammate. London-born Maja made his international debut for Super Eagles in a 2–2 friendly against Ukraine in September 2019.
