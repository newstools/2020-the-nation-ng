The three marketing communication outfits that jointly created the Nigeria @60 logo, Chain Reactions Nigeria, TBWA Africa and The Temple Management Company have refuted rumours making the rounds in social media that the logo was plagiarised. A joint statement released by the three firms said, “The attention of Chain Reactions Nigeria, The Temple Management and TBWA Africa has been drawn to an unfortunate conversation in some sections of the online media regarding the recently unveiled logo for the Nigerian Diamond Jubilee Celebration (Nigeria at 60) by President Muhammadu Buhari (GCFR). “This isn’t surprising as major brands and government initiatives have undergone a barrage of condemnations and commendations in times past. Are we surprised? No,”  The statement added: “The primary allegation of plagiarism on the unveiled logo deserves a quick dissection. To Plagiarise, according to Oxford Language Dictionary is to take someone else’s work or ideas and pass them off as one’s own. “To meet the qualified meaning of this definition, it means the Nigerian professionals who designed the campaign picked another logo that is exactly like this or similar to this and delivered it to the Federal government. Have they shown Nigerians the logo that looks exactly like the Nigeria @ 60 logo from another jurisdiction? ‘’A quick check on the internet shows that there are thousands of diamonds with crystals that look alike. The images on the Internet are there in any way for creative usage and purposes. Some are backed by rights and paid for while others are free.’’
