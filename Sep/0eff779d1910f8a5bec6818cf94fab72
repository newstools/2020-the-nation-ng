Ahead of Saturday’s governorship election in Edo State, rights activist, Dr. Joe Okei-Odumakin has called for the prosecution of perpetrators of election violence at the International Criminal Court (ICC). This is just as she warned security agencies against extrajudicial killings in the Edo and Ondo State polls. According to Okei-Odumakin, the needless deaths recorded during the elections in Kogi State were still fresh in the minds of Nigerians including that of a woman who was hacked after the exercise. “We cannot forget so soon how innocent souls were wasted during the elections in Kogi. We still carry deep pains in our hearts about the woman who was hacked to death even after the elections in Kogi. “While we commend the US for placing visa bans on election riggers, we would be glad to see perpetrators of violence during elections in Nigeria tried at the International Criminal Court. “Such a measure will deter our security forces from being used to waste the lives of innocent citizens for electoral manipulation. “It is important to let all those who will carry guns during election know that their own lives will be on the line for every life wasted. We have had enough of bestialities,” she said.
