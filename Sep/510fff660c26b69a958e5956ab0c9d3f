 Ahead of his much-anticipated debut album entitled ‘Ope (Gratitude),’ renowned Nigerian Grammy-winning recording artist and talking drum master, Sikiru Adepoju is out with a single, “Goin’ Somewhere.” The third of a nine-track album, “Goin’ Somewhere,” comes barely a month after Adepoju released “Take Me Home, Country Roads,” a vibrant remake of John Denver’s iconic song. All works are off his Ope (Gratitude) album – powered by the Riddim Doctors Project – to be released officially on September 24, 2020  “Goin’ Somewhere” began with Sikiru Adepoju and it flows from there – Zakir Hussain (Tablas) and Sikiru Adepoju (Dundun) spontaneously laid the foundation (on the Second Take) for Giovanni Hidalgo (Congas) to creatively finish in one take, leading to the construction of this living drum- machine taking – off unfettered, into the 21st century. The final output is a music credit for Sikiru Adepoju, Giovanni Hidalgo, Zakir Hussain, Femi Ojetunde, and Douglas Val Serrant.
