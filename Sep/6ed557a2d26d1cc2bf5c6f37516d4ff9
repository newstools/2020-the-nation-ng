The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ondo State has dismissed an allegation that its candidate, Eyitayo Jegede, is pursuing what is known as the Akure agenda. It said anybody making the allegation was attempting to localise a state issue. PDP spokesman Kennedy Peretei said in an interview that the victory of Jegede at the party’s primary was based on his antecedents and what he was coming to offer. He challenged the All Progressives Congress (APC) to campaign with its achievements, if any, rather than localising state issue. Peretei said: “Anybody saying PDP is pursuing Akure agenda is trying to localise a state issue. There is nowhere the candidate has gone to say he is from Akure. At the primaries, he won majority votes from other senatorial districts. He came out with a convincing victory. It is a ticket based on his personality, it is a ticket based on his antecedents and what he is coming to offer. His aspiration is not Akure based. It will not be correct to say he is pursuing Akure agenda. Yes, Akure has the largest voting population in the state. They can take advantage of that but not Akure agenda. “APC should go and check their records. At the last local government election, they got so much resistance despite contesting against themselves. They should tell us which area they have performed.”
