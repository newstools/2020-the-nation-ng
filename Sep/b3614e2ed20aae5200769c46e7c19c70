Former Ondo State governor Dr. Olusegun Mimiko has asked the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to campaign with the projects executed by the late Dr. Olusegun Agagu. Mimiko is the leader of the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP). The party has Deputy Governor Agboola Ajayi as its candidate in the October 10 governorship election. ZLP is regarded as the third force in Ondo State. Spokesman for the Ondo PDP, Kennedy Peretei, had in an interview, said the party would campaign with the projects and programmes executed during the administration of Mimiko because they were done on the party’s platform. He said Mimiko would not lay claims to the project while campaigning for ZLP because ZLP was never in power in the state. But a close aide to Mimiko, who pleaded anonymity, urged the PDP to campaign with the late Agagu’s projects. The aide said it was laughable for the visionary to be in one party and another party planned to campaign with his projects. According to the aide, “Mimiko is the man with the brilliant idea. You can see the PDP candidate already praising Mimiko to high heavens. In all his talks, it is Mimiko’s projects he is talking about. “It is not about the party, but the individuals. That talk by the PDP that Mimiko should not campaign with his projects is just a beer parlour talk.”
