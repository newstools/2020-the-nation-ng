The crisis rocking the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) took a new dimension following alleged violation of athletics code of conduct levelled against the AFN President, Ibrahim Shehu Gusau. Also at the weekend, the Court of Appeal in  Abuja  dismissed the suit filed by the Ministry of Youth and Sports Development challenging the ruling of the Abuja  Federal High Court recognising Gusau as the AFN president for lack of merit. Meanwhile,  Gusau  risks being slammed with a life ban after nine  AFN board members petitioned  the World Athletics Integrity Code of Conduct  for gross financial misconduct. Gusau was accused among other things of  diverting sponsorship  money belonging to AFN into a private account belonging to Sunday Adeleye who at the time was an elected member of the board. The money in question was paid by PUMA as a contractual fee for an equipment and licensing agreement reached with Gusau and Adeleye in July 2019, purportedly acting on behalf of the AFN, without the knowledge of the majority of its board members. Adeleye’s firm, Dynamic Sporting Solutions, was reportedly  appointed by Gusau to serve as consultant to the federation for the project which is considered a breach of World Athletics Integrity Code of Conduct Article 3 (Integrity Standards), sub-section 3.3.5 (Conflict of Interests). If found guilty, Gusau will be the second high profile African athletics official to be slammed  with a life ban after  former Vice President of Kenya Athletics Association(KAA) David Okeyo was decisively sanctioned. by the AIU in 2018 for reportedly diverting money meant for KAA  from NIKE into his private account for his personal use. Gusau is also alleged to have dragged the AFN to court, a decision frowned at by the Chief Executive Officer of World Athletics, Jon Ridgeon in his letter to the Minister of Youths and  Sports Development  Sunday Dare last month.
