President Muhammadu Buhari has approved an additional N8.9 billion for COVID-19 hazard allowance for all health workers in the country. This was announced on Thursday by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) and Chairman of the Presidential Task Force PTF on COVID-19, Mr. Boss Mustapha, during the task force’s media briefing in Abuja. He recalled that the recently called industrial action by the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD), as well as a threat by other professionals in the health sector, had dominated public discuss in the last few days. According to him, while appreciable progress has been made in the negotiations to resolve the issues, it must be underscored that the nation is in a global public health emergency situation that has impacted negatively on all aspects of lives including the economy and finances of the government. “This has made it imperative for all citizens irrespective of their professions and particularly health workers to reawaken their sense of humanity and patriotism. “The health and survival of our dear nation is important and we should eschew any action that will diminish the gains made in the containment of the pandemic so far. “I am pleased to announce that Mr. President has graciously approved additional N8.9bn for COVID-19 hazard allowance to all medical health workers. In addition, the procurement of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for hospitals and isolation centres will be given priority,” Mustapha said.
