Laycon has expressed confidence in Kiddwaya’s ability to excel outside the House following his eviction from the show. After 56 days in the BBNaija House, Kiddwaya was evicted alongside Prince for garnering the lowest votes of all Housemates up for eviction. Reacting to Kiddwaya’s eviction, Laycon said he’s confident that the 27-year-old will do great for himself outside the House. Laycon and Kiddwaya remained friends despite finding themselves in a love triangle with Erica. “I was happy Kiddwaya did not get a second strike before his eviction,” he told other Housemates. “He would do well outside, even though I feel bad about his eviction.’’ As if he knew, Kidd had said he wouldn’t regret if evicted on Sunday, he said he already feels blessed for being in the house for eighth week.
