 Hundreds of supporters of Edo Governor, Godwin Obaseki defied the rains to celebrate his victory at the governorship election on Sunday. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declared Obaseki, the candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) winner of the polls after he scored 307,955 as against the 223,619 votes his major opponent, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu garnered. Although Obaseki coasted to victory from early results from wards and local government collation centres early Sunday morning, Benin Metropolis was calm until the Resident Electoral Officer (REC) announced him winner around 2:39pm. As soon as the announcement was made, the city erupted with vehicles blarring sirens and honking nonstop. Within minutes, various groups of convoys surfaced across major streets and neighbourhood as though they had gathered in a place and awaiting a final whistle. From Ihama Road in GRA to Sapele Road and Ring Road, the jubilants, who mostly had the PDP flag on them hung on the sides of vehicles or sat atop, while others were seen dangerously riding power bikes and shouting “4 +4” “Ogbene.” Chanting victory songs, the jubilants were seen dancing in front of their homes, places of businesses saying “Edo people don talk. Na Obaseki we want.” A taxi driver who gave his name as Jude told our Correspondent he has not voted for a long time but decided he must this time around because of the “bad treatment” meted to Obaseki.
