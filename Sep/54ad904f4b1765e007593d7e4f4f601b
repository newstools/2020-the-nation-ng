 A member of the Governing Council of the University of Lagos (UNILAG), Mr. Bayo Adaralegbe, has joined former Council Chairman, Dr. Wale Babalakin, to resign from his position. Adaralegbe, who works at Babalakin’s chambers , tendered his resignation to the Education Minister, Adamu Adamu, on Friday, stating that his continued stay would dishonour his late father, Prof. Adeniji Adaralegbe’s memory. Adaralegbe was one of the Federal Government appointees on the council who were staunch supporters of Babalakin. In the letter, Adaralegbe praised Babalakin’s contributions to the university. He said: “Dr Babalakin provided very strong moral leadership as Pro Chancellor and Chairman of Council. He kept scrupulously to the promise he made at our maiden Council meeting not to bid for, or be awarded contracts from the university. He actually did more. By December 2019, he had poured approximately N100 million of his own personal resources on different endeavours in the university. “At the time this situation arose, he was in the process of transferring to the university (at no cost to it) 40 hectares of land he owned in Ogudu, Lagos to address its staff housing problems. Those of us federal government appointees followed his strong moral leadership.” Adaralegbe also denied claims that he got his council role by claiming to be from another state. As a council member, Adaralegbe said he sought no material benefits from the university. “Our council took its work very seriously. We served very selflessly, very diligently and worked extremely hard to manage the scarce resources of the university and improve its standing.”
