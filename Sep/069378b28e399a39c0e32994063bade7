Imo Government has ordered about 3,000 families directly affected by the landslide that occurred last week at Okohia Akwakuma in Owerri North Council Area to relocate immediately. The slide affected many homes and buildings. Commissioner for Environment, Dr. Iyke Njoku, told The Nation the displaced families should leave their residences immediately to avoid calamity. He said: “We have asked them to temporary find a place to stay and we have asked the Federal Government to urgently come to the aid of the families and state government. “It is a very big landslide which has affected many homes and houses.” Njoku said the state was considering short, medium and long term measures to prevent the slide from escalating. He however lamented the situation was beyond the state government considering the parlous economic state, declaring Imo has over 300 erosion sites. “So we are calling on the Federal Government, ecological fund office and International donor agency to come to our aid to save the state from submerging.” He recalled the state government has promised to send some palliatives to the displaced persons. The Nation reports there has been mass exodus of landlords and tenants in the area. A resident, Emma Ogu, said families have started moving out of their homes. “We were eased out from a broken fenced wall through the bush after five days of being trapped,” he said.
