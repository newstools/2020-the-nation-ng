The Federal University Lokoja (FUL), Kogi State, has begun the search for a new Vice Chancellor (VC) to succeed Prof. Angela Freeman-Miri, whose tenure ends early next year. The search team for Freeman-Miri’s successor includes one member each from the academic and non-academic staff raised through an election. Two other members were elected – one each from the teaching and non-teaching staff – to represent the institution at the third Governing Council meeting of the university scheduled to hold soon. This is in line with the Miscellaneous Provisions Act No 11 (as amended) towards the selection of new vice chancellors in the nation’s universities. Prof. Abdullahi Emmanuel Bala of the Geology Department, and Mrs Omoayena Duro-Bello, Deputy Registrar and Academic Secretary of the university, were elected for the search team, while Dr. Emmanuel Bala of the Physics Department and Mr. Benjamin Ocholi Atabo of the Bursary Department were elected to represent workers at the third University Governing Council as Inter-nal members. The university, in a statement by the Public Relations Officer (PRO), Emmanuel Bello, said the election was peaceful, transparent, free and fair. Freeman-Miri congratulated those elected and wished them success in their assignments, charging them to work for the progress of the university, noting that the assignment before them is very critical to the development of the institution. She thanked those who worked tirelessly towards the peaceful conduct of the election and wished them well.
