 The All Progressives Congress Consolidation Group, (APC-CG) has warned that Nigeria’s climb to the third place could shut the doors to foreign investments and bring down the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The Institute for Economics and Peace, an independent, non-partisan, non-profit think-tank organisation with an office in New York had in its sixth GTI report ranked Nigeria among countries worst hit by terrorism globally. The APC group also warned that the country could experience severe famine next year if urgent steps were not taken to address the insecurity in the land. The group said this could frustrate President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration’s huge investment in agriculture being championed through the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).
