 THE Federal Government has been urged to grant the state government some power to oversee licensed miners  to protect the people living in the communities where these mining are taking place. A Fellow of Accountability Lab Nigeria, John Oluwafemi, stated this after Act Hub Africa rolled out a survey prototyping the Social and Environmental Impact Assessment Audit idea being incubated at Accountability Lab Nigeria. The Survey titled: ‘’Understanding the awareness level of the citizens: pivotal for environmental accountability,’’ advocates to forge a direction towards ensuring Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) compliance in Nigeria. He said the country is confronted with environmental challenges that require strategic investigation and better integration among the health, ecologic, economic, and social sciences.
