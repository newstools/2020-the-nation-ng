Studying abroad has never been an easy journey, especially for students coming from a low income country as Nigeria. Your dreams are valid! Often times, this dream is hampered by lack of information or inadequate funds. There is always a huge financial budget, which invariably does not guarantee success, thus leaving many aspirants bankrupt and disappointed. Knowledge, they say, is power but also an edge. Access to the right information saves a million mistakes. That is the reason, we at Vantage Migration and Allied Consult are committed to teaching graduate students how to secure admissions and scholarships by themselves. Before now, people think that scholarship abroad are designated for graduates with outstanding grades alone. This is not the whole truth. Papered qualification is a test of intelligence alone, and when it comes to Standard Western Education System skills are valued more than certificate. In other words, the grade one graduated with is never an issue to securing admission/scholarship. This is the truth we are ready to make bare. From our research, most of the reasons many students are denied Study VISAS/admissions/scholarships abroad are largely attributed to poor application processes and lack of detailed information. Thus, We fill these lapses. Our mission is to alleviate the plights of uninformed/misinformed graduate students. We understand that the surest way to secure admission and scholarships abroad is by self-application. This is what Vantage stands for. We teach admission/scholarship hack to graduate students so they can easily apply and secure admission/scholarships to develop their career and educational goals abroad. Our strategies, approach and methods are result-oriented. Even with a poor grade, our clients do not need to hire or be held hostage by an educational agent. This is not “business as usual” thing.
