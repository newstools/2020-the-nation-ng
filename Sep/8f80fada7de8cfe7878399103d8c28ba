 Mavin Records signee, Johnny Drille has described himself as a principled man who lives by his rules. According to the ‘Halleluyah’ singer, fans should accept him for who he is. “My music, my simple lifestyle, my faith, my hairstyle, etc, I do all that because they’re what I want and I’m happy with my choices, ” Drille said. Continuing, the Edo born artiste says, “I also want you to know one principle that I’ve always lived by, and that is to do anything I want, the way I want.  “I’d also like for you all amazing fans to accept me for who I am. I don’t want to have to explain my lifestyle to anyone and if you still don’t get it I’ll still understand that,” he reiterated. Drille first got the attention of Mavin’s CEO Don Jazzy after he released a cover of Di’Ja ‘Awww’ in 2015. “I also want you to live your life and be happy with it, don’t let anybody dictate to you how you should live because that way you may become unhappy. Live your life, by your rules. Live,” he said.
