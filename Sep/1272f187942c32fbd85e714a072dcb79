The Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) has said the claims that a Kaduna-Abuja train KA4 was attacked by bandits between Asham and Kubwa on Monday is false. The Managing Director of NRC, Engr. Fidet Okhiria however said the route is faced with the challenge of hoodlums who usually throw heavy stones at the moving train. He also said that one of the suspects involved in throwing stones at the train on Monday was apprehended by security agents, adding that efforts are ongoing to forestall such acts. This is contained in a statement in Abuja on Tuesday by the Media Assistant to the Minister of Transportation, Mrs. Taiye Elebiyo-Edeni. It reads: “There were no bandits’ attacks on the train. It is just a rumour otherwise they will see the bullet holes all over the train. It was hoodlums that threw stones on the train and because the Police got one suspect, more hoodlums came out at night to attack the train in protest against the arrest made in the afternoon. “NRC has, however, spoken to security agencies to help prevent such future occurrences and intervene in the matter. So, they will know how best to deal with the situation. “We however urge the public using the train not to panic, as the Minister of Transportation and NRC will ensure the safety of Nigerians on that route.”
