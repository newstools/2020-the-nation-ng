Leaders of three of the four workers’ unions at the University of Lagos (UNILAG) are currently before the special Visitation Panel investigating the institution’s affairs. The chairmen of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU), and the Non-Academic Staff Union (NASU) were admitted into the Council Chambers, venue of the hearing at 2 pm. ASUU Chairman, Dr. Dele Ashiru, said the union came prepared with a team of four for the hearing but he was the only one allowed into the venue. Kehinde Ajibade represented NASU in his capacity as Chairman, main campus; while Tunde Aderibigbe represented NASU, College of Medicine, Idi-Araba campus. SSANU was represented by its Acting Chairman, main campus, Olusola Sowumi, and Ag. Chairman, Idi-Araba campus, Michael Olofindiran. No member of the National Association of Academic Technologists (NAAT) was present at press time. When asked about Babalakin’s presence on campus despite ASUU declaring him a persona non-grata, Ashiru said Babalakin, who appeared before the panel Thursday morning, was not on campus in his official position. “Babalakin came here as Wale Babalakin and not as Pro-Chancellor. In line with the directive of the Federal Government, he has been recused as Pro-Chancellor. “It is gratifying that someone who was playing the Lord of the manor can now be made to appear before a panel,” he said.
