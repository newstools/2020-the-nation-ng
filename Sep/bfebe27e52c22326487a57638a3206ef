If there was one woman who made the heart of Octogenarian Oyo Monarch beats faster, it would definitely be Olori Badirat Ajoke Adeyemi aka queen Nola. At one time in the Oyo palace, Queen Nola was the talk of the palace with Alaafin constantly doting on her. She was always smitten with the highly respected monarch and a regular feature beside Alaafin at any social function. Queen Nola consistently stands out among the Oyo queens with her ravishing beauty, fashion sense and attire combination, skin routine, and composure. However, those days seem to have quickly vanished like sand in the wind. The young mother, brand influencer and entrepreneur, entered 2020 with various reports of alleged infidelity with a popular Fuji musician. Though she openly refuted the claim saying she was loyal to the vows of her marriage and would never cheat on the highly revered monarch, all pleas seem to have fallen on deaf ears as she has been excused from the palace till the conclusion of the investigation. Olori Badirat has been missing in action lately in the King’s harem. She no longer posts pictures of herself in the palace and was also left out in a group picture of the king and his wives released months ago by the palace. Lately, Olori Badirat had always posted quite ‘subliminal messages’ with pregnant innuendos on her social media pages. The post on her social media pages further showed that she is not having the best of time. What has now become jolting to Queen Nola is the decision of the ever-young-at-heart royal majesty, the very personification of the dreaded death, to marry another ravishing Olori. Many said the new Olori is a possible replacement for the lacuna Olori Badirat created in the palace. It seems like attention may have shifted away, totally, and finally from her.
