Suspected Peoples Democratic Party’s (PDP’s) thugs have torn the campaign banners of the All Progressives Congress’ (APC’s) governorship candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu. A statement by the Chairman, Edo State APC Media Campaign Council, Mr. John Mayaki, said the incident occurred between Friday night and Saturday morning at Ward 4 in Oredo Local Government. He said the party condemned the actions of the “vandals of the night”, asking why the PDP was “trying to bail water out of a sunk ship.”  Mayaki said: “Continuing its worrisome trend of violence and destruction by day and night, PDP members have damaged up to 70 campaign banners of the APC. If you remember, they left their campaigns and vandalised our banners, disrupting our rallies last month. Despite the peace accord agreed to at the Oba of Benin’s palace, PDP thugs still did this. This is a violation of what the party promised at the Oba’s palace. What do they hope to achieve? What they’re doing amounts to going to a ship that has sunk to the ocean bed four years ago and bailing water out of it. It won’t work.”
