Laycon has described Erica’s disqualification as the worse day of his life. He stated this to Dorathy during a conversation on Monday. “Yesterday was the worst of my life in this house, Dora. You’re the first person I’m telling this and probably the only person I will tell,” he began. Laycon said he regrets staying away from Erica while she was in the House. “I keep thinking that if I hadn’t given her space, maybe this would not have happened. “You know the odd thing as I jumped on the chair in the HoH Lounge, I saw her earrings. “I gave them to Kiddwaya. I can’t keep it because she might not want me to have it, I really feel bad,” he added.
