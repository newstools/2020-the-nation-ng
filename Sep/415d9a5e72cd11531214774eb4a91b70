A 35-year-old Malaysia returnee Samuel Kalu has been reportedly killed by yet-to-be-identified gunmen in Aba, the commercial nerve of Abia State. The incident was said to have happened at Umuibe Street, off Item road in Aba South Local Government Area of the state. Kalu, an indigene of Igbere, Bende Local Government Area of the resident in Aba before he left for Malaysia, was said to have returned to meet his family members and friends a few days before he was killed by the gunmen. It was gathered Kalu had finished having a haircut in a makeshift barbing saloon and was on his way back home when he was gunned down. An eyewitness, who simply identified himself as Emmanuel, stated he was drinking in one of the shops along the road when he saw about 15 boys heading towards a direction. He said he heard shouts they had gunned down a young man who was later identified as Kalu. Police Public Relations Officer, SP Geoffrey Ogbonna could not be reached for comments. But a source within the Abia State Police Command confirmed the incident, adding the investigation was ongoing. The Aba South Transition Committee Chairman, Fred Ogwo who visited the scene condemned the killing. Ogwo assured that the perpetrators would soon be nabbed by security agencies.
