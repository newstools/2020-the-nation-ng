 IJAW Youths Council (IYC) Worldwide has mourned Prof. Kimse Okoko, a two-time president of Ijaw National Congress (INC). Sources said Okoko (80) died Sunday in Port Harcourt. His son, Keniebi, died earlier this year. A statement by its President, Peter Igbifa, described Okoko’s death as a double jeopardy. He said the deceased was a scholar, leader, father and patriot.  It reads: “Okoko’s death, coming a few months after his son’s death, is a double jeopardy and an incalculable loss to the Ijaw nation. “Prof. Kimse Okoko was a patriot, a champion of restructuring, an apostle of true federalism and resource control, as well as a fearless defender of the Ijaw nation.” “We have lost a great leader. His death has created a vacuum in our struggle. May God give the family and the Ijaw nation the fortitude to bear this loss.”
