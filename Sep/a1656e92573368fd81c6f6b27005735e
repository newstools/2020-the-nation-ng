Immediate past governor of Delta state, Dr. Emmanuel Uduaghan has charged Nigerian youths to shun kidnapping, as well as other social vices in the society. Uduaghan stated this when he received former Super Eagles defensive midfielder, Christian Obodo, at his residence in Warri, Delta state, at the weekend. He also apologised on behalf of Deltans for the ugly incident of the footballer’s kidnap in the state, while he was governor, eight years ago. The footballer who retired recently from his Greece Football Club, Appollon Smyrnis, visited the ex-governor, to appreciate him for the swift response of the state government under his leadership at the time of his abduction. He visited in the company of ace sports broadcaster, Azuka Chiamaka and a friend, Engineer Sam. Recall that Christian Obodo was abducted by gunmen on Saturday, June 9, 2012 in Effurun, near Warri and whisked to the Isoko North axis of Delta state. He regained his freedom the following day. Commending him for a “successful football career,” Dr. Uduaghan tasked youths to be creative and develop good skills, rather than take to acts of criminality. Speaking to newsmen shortly after the visit, Obodo who is renowned for his dribbling skills, urged youths not to allow hardship push them into criminal activities, as they may lose their lives in the process. He further expressed gratitude to Dr. Uduaghan for the “fatherly support and love” showed him and his family when he was kidnapped. Until his retirement, Obodo played for several foreign clubs such as Lecce, Torino, Udinese among others. He hinted that he is now in the business of scouting for young and skillful talents who will take Nigerian football to greater heights.
