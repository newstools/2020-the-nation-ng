 Nigeria’s Georgia Oboh did herself and country proud  at the just concluded Czech Ladies Open held at the Beroun Golf Club in Beroun just outside Prague , in the Czech Republic. Oboh started the tournament with an opening round of 69(3 under par ) and then shot scores of 72 (level par ) and 74 (2 over par ) to gross the tournament out at 1 under par for the three days to finish in 42nd position out of 132 ladies that competed. Oboh was delighted  with the performance coming after  four months of lockdown in Nigeria but highlighted the lack of proper preparation due to funding as a factor still plaguing  her game. The teenage sensation moves to Switzerland to compete in the next two events which are the Flumsberg Ladies Open in Gams Switzerland from 3-5th September and the VP Bank Ladies Open in Zurich from the 10-12th September. The Czech ladies Open was won by Emily Pedersen of Denmark who plays full time on the LPGA but currently in Europe following play at the Women’s  Open and the Scottish Ladies Open where she lost in the play offs.
