Lagos State Police Command has deployed 1,000 cops in Edo State ahead of Saturdayâ€™s governorship election. The deployment followed a directive by the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu, for enhanced security before, during and after the election. Adamu had announced the deployment of 30,000 police officers to be drawn from commands and formations for the poll. The Nation last week reported that intelligence reports available to the police indicated that politicians were arming and shipping thugs to Edo State for violence, a development the IGP warned against. Admonishing the Lagos contingent yesterday, Police Commissioner (CP) Hakeem Odumosu said they must exhibit professionalism in the discharge of their duties. Odumosu, according to a statement by spokesman Olumuyiwa Adejobi told them that the focus of the command was the sustenance of democratic values through fair, free and credible elections. He assured them that their welfare had been approved by the IGP, saying the package was a morale booster for those sent for the operation.
