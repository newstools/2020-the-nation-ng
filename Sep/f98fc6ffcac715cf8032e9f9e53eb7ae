 THE Onisa of Iru, Victoria Island, Chief Wasiu Ogunbambi and nine others have asked the Federal High Court in Lagos to compel the police, three children and a sibling of the former Oniru of Iru to pay a N500million fine for ‘unlawful arrest and detention.’ Ogunbambi alleged that nine of the applicants were arrested in Lagos by the Police Special Tactical Squad, Force Headquarters, Abuja, and taken to the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) where they were detained for between three and eight days without charge. Ogunbambi’s co-plaintiffs are: his sons Mukaila and Lateef Ogunbambi, Lateef Tobi Shofowora, Wasiu Amodu, Alhaji Kabiru, Dada Oluwole Michael, Lawrence Aihevba, Adekunle Remi and Ahmed Alaya as second to 10th applicants. The respondents are: three brothers, Tijani Olabisi Oniru, Ademola Abiodun Oniru and Adesegun Abiodun Oniru; the former Oniru’s sibling Suleiman Alaba Oniru and the Inspector-General of Police (IGP). Chief Ogunbambi averred in his September 4 affidavit in support of the originating motion, that their ordeal between August 22 and 25, followed a petition by the first to fourth respondents. He said his house on Victoria Island was “invaded by over 15 armed policemen” who turned his apartment “upside down at gunpoint” but “no single incriminating item” was recovered from his house or his son’s bar. He said they then visited Lateef’s bar and arrested six customers – the 4th to 10th applicants. The six, alongside three other applicants, were then “packed in a small bus” and then taken to Abuja in a 10-hour road journey where they were detained. After between three and eight days, they were released on bail. He averred further that their ordeal was intended to intimidate, embarrass and harass him, following his refusal to support a particular candidate against the current Oniru of Iru.
