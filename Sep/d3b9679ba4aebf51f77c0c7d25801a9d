Napoli’s Victor Osimhen has put his Pescara disappointment aside and the Nigeria international is ready to face any side that comes his way. The Parthenopeans’ most expensive signing was criticised after failing to score in Napoli’s 4-0 win over Pescara in last weekend’s preseason friendly game despite scoring back-to-back hat trick in two previous friendly games against Avila and Teramo. He had set his sights on returning to scoring goals in tonight’s game against Sporting Lisbon but the high profile pre-season clash was abandoned after three Sporting players tested positive for coronavirus. Napoli had already travelled to Lisbon and prepared thoroughly for the friendly fixture. “I am ever ready and the only thing that can stop me is when I am sick or have a knock,” The 21 year-old told NationSport. “I am ready to go into any game regardless of the team we are going to play against; I will also ensure that we get the best out of the game.” Osimhen joined the Italian giants on a five-year-deal for an African record 81m Euros, including add-ons, after an impressive debut season at Lille, where he scored 18 goals in 38 appearances across all competitions.
