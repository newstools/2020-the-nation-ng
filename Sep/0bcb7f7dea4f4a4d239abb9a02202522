 FORMER Commissioner for Information in Ebonyi State, Abia Onyike, has called on Governor David Umahi to act on allegations of “possible sale of some landed properties and houses located in Lagos or any other properties belonging to Ebonyi State Government in any other part of Nigeria.” Onyike pleaded with Umahi not to sweep this allegation under the carpet, pointing out that Ebonyians at home and in the Diaspora, in reaction to the said allegations, “would like to know what is happening or has happened to Ebonyi State Government properties in Lagos, Abuja, Enugu, Aba and other places.” In a press release made available to The Nation, Onyike called on Ebonyi State Government to set up a panel of inquiry to probe into the status of Ebonyi State properties  scattered all over Nigeria, with a view to carrying out inventory of such properties for proper documentation and accountability.” The release said in part: “Following the recent outcry and disclosures made by some concerned citizens of Ebonyi State, alleging that Ebonyi State Government’s buildings and landed properties located in Lagos have been surreptitiously sold off to or taken over by unknown persons, with the possible connivance or conspiracy of some top government officials of Ebonyi State, and having confirmed the authenticity of the allegations from some Ebonyi indigenes resident in Lagos, I wish to react and state as follows: That as a concerned citizen of Ebonyi State and as one of those who fought for the creation of the state, it is incumbent on me and other agitated patriots, to always rise to the occasion as circumstances may  demand, to defend the collective/common interests of  all Ebonyians, especially on  issues and matters relating to our common patrimony; that I commend the alertness  of the Association of Ebonyi Indigenes in Diaspora  and their sincere/patriotic  alarm raised  over the dubious attempt or act of selling off or taking over of the said landed properties and buildings, located in Lagos and belonging to the  people and government  of Ebonyi, without  due process.”
