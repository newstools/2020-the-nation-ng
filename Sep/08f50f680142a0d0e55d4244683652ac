Nigerian boxer, Efe Ajagba’s 13-fight unbeaten run will be tested when he takes on experienced American Jonathan Rice in a heavyweight contest tomorrow. The 2016 Olympian returns after almost seven months outside the ring to face Rice in his Top Rank on ESPN debut in a 10-rounder as the co-feature to the Jose Pedraza-Javier Molina junior welterweight main event from The Bubble, MGM Grand Las Vegas. Ajagba signed with Bob Arum’s Top Rank Boxing earlier last month, after being previously promoted by Richard Schaefer’s Ringstar Sports and last fought in March, when he knocked out former world title challenger Razvan Cojanu in nine rounds. “This is boxing, this is my life,” Ajagba told BoxingScene.com. “I am excited to be back again doing what I love. “The only disappointment is that my (first) fight will not have fans in attendance; I really feed off of the fans, they motivate me and give me energy in the ring. “ And the fans not being in attendance, means that they will be watching at home. They will be pleased with what they see this weekend.”
