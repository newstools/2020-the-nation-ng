Ikechukwu Madu’s hard work has finally paid off and he has decided to use his position to help Nigerians who hope to thrive in business someday. Being the first child with three sisters, Madu understood that they looked up to him for directions. His desire to build his own business started as a young boy, where he hawked different wares for his mom on the streets of Emene, Enugu State. Madu, who runs an online marketplace – Ojaayo, has now opened up opportunities for young people with his new initiative, Ojaayo Apprenticeship Programme, where he would randomly select 5 people that will “serve” literally and get “settled” at the end of each year with the sum of N500,000 to start their own businesses. According to him, the apprenticeship programme is his way of giving back to the society and helping people to be their own bosses. Based in the United Kingdom, Madu also owns Maxicoin Exchange Limited, Maxicoin properties Limited, Maxicoin Business development and Strategy Limited.
