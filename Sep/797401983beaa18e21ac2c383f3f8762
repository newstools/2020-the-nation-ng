Nomadic  Serbian coach Bora Milutinovic has recalled his momentous times with the Super  Eagles at the France 98 as he was  celebrated on Monday by the world football governing body, FIFA on his 76th anniversary. Bora  is the first coach to lead five countries to the World Cup as well as the only coach to have led four nations past the first round at the FIFA World Cup. “It’s called the world’s game for a reason and my World Cup record is more than a record to me,” the  gregarious Serbian told FIFA.com. “This is my life and my great honour as a human being,” he continued. “For me it all blends together into one great honour and one great experience that I can never forget. “From Mexico to China, my memories are so deep and meaningful. There were always differences between the jobs and the different countries.” Milutinovic led Super Eagles to the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France where Nigeria qualified to the second round before losing  scandalously 4-1 to  Denmark. “ The problems that players faced in Costa Rica in 1990 were not the same as the players faced in 2002 in China or in Nigeria when I was there. “ But the beauty of football is that it is the same – in a very meaningful way – all over the world. The game, for me and in my heart, is the same no matter where you go. “When I am coaching in a country I feel almost like I become a citizen of that country. This was the same in Mexico and Nigeria and even China. I look closely at the traits of the people and what moves them and I try to respond to these things.”
