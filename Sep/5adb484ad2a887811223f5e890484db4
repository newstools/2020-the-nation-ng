 LIVERPOOL started the new Premier League campaign with a 4-3 thriller against Leeds with Mohamed Salah scoring a hat-trick for the champions. The Premier League newcomers were just minutes from securing a point at Anfield but for a Rodrigo foul in the penalty box. Salah stepped up to net his second from the spot and hand Jurgen Klopp’s side all three points. The Egyptian said on Sky Sports: “Leeds are a tough team. They had a great game and reacted really well. “I’m happy about the result and we have to keep on improving. It’s important for me to stay focused. We had a good game.” Liverpool and Leeds both struggled defensively in the match as the attackers took centre stage. The Reds took an early lead but Marcelo Bielsa’s side hit back every time they took the lead. That was underlined by Klopp saying ‘Wow’ on the full-time whistle as he knew the champions had to work very hard for the win.
