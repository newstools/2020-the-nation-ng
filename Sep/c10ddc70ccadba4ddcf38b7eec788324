 KEBBI State Governor Atiku Bagudu has stated his administration would partner with Amana Farmers and Grains Suppliers Association of Nigeria (AFGASAN) to foster the development of food production. Bagudu made this known in Birnin Kebbi on Monday while receiving members of AFGASAN, led by its National Chairman Haruna Pambeguwa. Bagudu said the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari had impacted a legacy of wealth creation, employment generation and economic prosperity through its active policy of agricultural revival. He said Buhari’s sincere commitment to attaining food security for the nation propelled him to becoming the Chairman of the National Food Security Council, while Bagudu served as the Deputy Chairman. “God has blessed Nigeria with fertile agricultural land suitable for cultivation all-year-round. “The present administration will utilise such endowments by encouraging and providing the necessary material and financial support to the farmers, to increase yields.” Bagudu praised the president for protecting the interests of local farmers by prohibiting cheap food imports through border closure and uplifting the value of agricultural produce internally. “President Buhari did not just close our borders simply because he wants to do so, it is because he has the interest of protecting Nigerian farmers’ first.” The governor reiterated his commitment to the provision of finance, farm inputs, implements and training on modern farming methods to farmers in the state. Earlier, Pambeguwa informed the governor that members of the association were in Birnin Kebbi for a meeting and the inauguration of the state chapter. He described Governor Bagudu as the architect of the agricultural revolution in the country and worthy of emulation. “Your efforts in the agricultural sector of the country has made it possible for Nigeria to attain self- sufficiency in rice production.”
