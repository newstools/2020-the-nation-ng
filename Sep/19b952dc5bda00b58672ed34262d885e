Defender David Alaba is doubtful while winger Leroy Sane will miss Wednesday’s domestic Super Cup game against Borussia Dortmund with a knee injury, Bayern Munich’s coach Hansi Flick said on Tuesday. Bayern Munich, who won four titles this year, lost Sunday’s league game at Hoffenheim 4-1 to suffer their first defeat of 2020. “Leroy is out. He will most likely be out until after the break for international matches (between Oct. 7 and Oct. 13),” Flick told reporters. He added that defender Alaba was doubtful with a muscle problem, with a final decision to be taken on matchday. The Bavarians almost played through the summer with no real pre-season preparation as they lifted the UEFA Champions League in August. They also beat Sevilla last week in the European Super Cup to secure their fourth trophy after also winning the German league and Cup. Flick however waved aside the possibility that the situation might be a way of requesting a break by the players. “No one has come to me asking for a break,” Flick said. “We know that this season will be a major challenge, not only for us but all teams with many international players. “For us, it is a bit different situation. We had no real pre-season and we had two breaks of two weeks.’’ He nonetheless said his team was mentally strong, in spite of the loss to Hoffenheim which ended their 32-game unbeaten run across all competitions. “I can only say that the mentality is outstanding,” Flick said. “It could be the case that one player or another is or was a bit tired, but when they are on the pitch they give it 100 percent,“he said.
