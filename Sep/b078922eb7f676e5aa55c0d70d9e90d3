Netting 18 goals in all competitions for Lille in the French Ligue 1 last season; Super Eagles striker Victor Osimhen has said that he has no goals target for his new club Napoli this season. The hotshot goal scorer earned a $70m transfer to Italy to set Africa’s and Napoli’s highest transfer record. The 21-year-old had an excellent pre-season scoring form where he scored back-to-back hat tricks against Avila and Teramo and is set for his Serie A debut for the Partenopei against Parma on Sunday. “I am happy for the goals I scored pre-season,” Osimhen told CAFONLINE.COM “I am not the kind of player that set a number of goals I am going to score for my team because I am a team player; I don’t set personal targets before that of the team. “I just want to score as much as I can for my team, help them do well and win trophies. “So, there are no personal targets for me; I just want to do well and get the goals for my team.”
