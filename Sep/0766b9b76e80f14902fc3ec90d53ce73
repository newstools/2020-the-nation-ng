 CHAIRMAN of Edo State Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Campaign Council Chief Dan Orbih has said the governorship election will end godfatherism. He urged the electorate to vote for the party to ensure the re-election of Governor Godwin Obaseki. Orbih, speaking at the campaign of Obaseki at Usen Ward 7, Ovia South West Local Government, said Obaseki’s re-election would ensure the consolidation of successes recorded by his administration in the first term. Governor Obaseki said his administration would provide security for voters. He alleged that the opposition All Progressives Congress (APC) and its leadership, in desperation, have resorted to importing thugs and arming youths with guns to cause violence, in order to subvert the will of Edo people. Obaseki said: “It is clear that this election can’t be won by the number of thugs the APC has been importing into the state. People will decide who leads them.”
