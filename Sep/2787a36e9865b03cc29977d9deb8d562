BHM has voted N100 million, over the next couple of years, for digital resource that will transform public relations and communications in Africa. This intervention, according to the company, is an important step in solving the industry’s several pain points, adding that it will replace the company’s already existing BHM App which was introduced in 2014. The new app, Qomms, it said, will also serve as a pool of resources for the public relations practitioners as it is an upgraded application designed to meet the information needs of practitioners around the continent, and elsewhere. With this digital intervention, BHM is repositioning itself to solve some of the most painful problems facing public relations and communications today including education and training, recruitment, measurement, standardisation, compensation, and networks. The CEO and Founder of BHM, Ayeni Adekunle, said: ‘At BHM, we have a duty to not only contribute to the industry, but also to activate resources that will solve problems in our field. Qomms is set to revolutionize the industry and we are excited to be at the forefront of this.” Over the years, BHM has earned an enviable reputation from the impressive work done for a number of brands across various industries, as well as for its brilliant use of social media and its contribution to the PR Industry. The agency has consistently put out a compendium of research pieces which include four editions of Nigerian PR Report as well two editions of the “Concept of Virality” published in 2016 and 2020. BHM Group is also the parent company of Info Digital Africa (ID Africa), a creative marketing communications, digital media and technology company and Plaqad – a tech startup that uses marketing, technology and a community of social advocates to solve marketing communications problems.
