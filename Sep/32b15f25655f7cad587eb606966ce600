The Coalition Against COVID-19 (CACOVID) has denied a media report that House of Representatives member for Oredo Constituency in Edo, Dr Omoreigbe Ihama, donated the palliatives he made claims to in the constituency. The House of Reps member, in a report on Independent Television, Benin, Edo stated besides sponsoring bills and motions, he will continue to champion the course of improving the lives in the constituency. He also added since outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, he has given out food items and networked with other agencies to attract relief materials to Oredo constituency. He spoke while supervising distribution of the palliatives, which had CACOVID logo plastered all over them.  But CACOVID refuted his claims, saying the palliatives were parts of its efforts to feed 1.7million households in the 774 local government areas of the country. It said the initiative kicked off in Bauchi, Jigawa, Kogi, Anambra, Ogun, Kebbi, Ekiti, Borno, Yobe Enugu, Plateau, Benue, Nasarawa and Edo States. CACOVID is a private-sector alliance tasked with pulling resources across industries to provide technical and operational support while providing funding and building advocacy through aggressive awareness. So far, the coalition has built and revamped testing and isolation centres to strengthen the response capacity of states. It also supported the NCDC with over 300,000 test kits and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
