 The Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu, has said his men will remain neutral and professional as they ensure the maintenance of law and order in the coming Edo and Ondo governorship elections. Adamu, who spoke when he received civil society organisations (CSOs) to brainstorm on measures to ensure hitch free elections, said the police would use resources to ensure a level playing field for the parties involved in the elections. The IGP, who pointed out the likelihood of violence in the elections, said the police had deployed intelligence to generate threat analysis, which would be used to sustain their processes in elections in both states, to prevent breakdown of law and order.  He said the police acknowledged the contributions of CSOs as key actors in electioneering processes, hence the need for interactive sessions in view of the coming elections. “The objective is to share knowledge and compare knowledge, especially with regards to experience in election security in Nigeria. “We shall have discussions on key indicators of key election security threats, especially arming and movements of political thugs, use of inciting statements during campaigns, the likelihood of violence, issue of misinformation and disinformation aimed at heating up the polity,” Adamu said.
