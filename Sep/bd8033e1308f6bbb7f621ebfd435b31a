One of the best ways to reduce poverty is to encourage the growth of the food sector, says an official of PZ Wilmar Food Limited. He said empowering people it described as foodpreneurs will have a multiplier effect on the informal economy. The firm’s Category & Brand Manager, Toyin Popoola-Diana, who spoke in Lagos during the grand finale of the King’s Chef Challenge organised by Devon King’s, a brand of PZ Wilmar, said it has been the goal of the brand to not only provide consumers with quality products but also empower upcoming food-preneurs just as was done earlier this year with the Season 1 of Street Food Naija Kings. “I am impressed by the level of hard work and creativity put into this challenge because I know surely that making meals that are befitting of a King doesn’t come easy. We created the Devon King’s Delightful Sessions hosted by Chef Obubu, to provide an avenue for you all to not only test the functionality and excellent quality of Devon King’s products – cooking oil & cooking margarine but also acquire new cooking/baking skills from our Super Chef Obubu. It was only right that we put the knowledge gained to a test, which is what brought about ‘The King’s Chef Challenge’. ‘’Simply put, it was an avenue to showcase your culinary, creative and innovative skills as inspired by the Devon King’s Delightful Sessions,” Popoola-Diana said. Ten and young chefs were rewarded with prizes worth N1 million. Muniratu Abubakar emerged winner after her three-course meal which includes an appetiser, garlic bread; main course, basmati white rice with chicken sauce, salad & buttered stuffed plantain and dessert, lemon drizzle cake was adjudged the best in terms of creativity, meal presentation and meal outlook. She was presented with the grand prize of N200, 000, a standing gas cooker, a mixer and six months’ supply of Devon King’s products.
