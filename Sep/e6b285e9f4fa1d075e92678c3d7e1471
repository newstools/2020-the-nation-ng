Bahd Guy record signee, Sir Dauda has featured Simi and Good Girl LA in his introductory EP, ‘Love Ex Machina.’ This is coming two years after Falz the Bhad Guy unveiled Sir Dauda as the first music act on his Bahd Guy record label. In a close-knit listening session, Sir Dauda recently presented his five-track EP dubbed “Love Ex Machina” to media executives, music buffs, producers, and fans. Speaking on the EP title “Love Ex Machina,” Sir Dauda loosely translates the title to mean ‘Love to the rescue’. The EP, which has his 2019 hit single ‘Landlord’ as a bonus track, also has four new tracks including ‘Woman,’ which features Simi, and ‘Logba Logba’ which features GoodGirl LA. Describing his genre of music as Jungle Funk, Sir Dauda says he hopes his authentic stories will resonate with the public with his debut EP. The singer also noted that it would be hard for him to pick a favourite track from the EP saying, “My sound is a blend of different styles and each track on the EP gives a very spiritual feel that fans would love and appreciate, so picking just one favourite track won’t be easy for them.” The project is produced by Willis, Chillz, Sizzle PRO, and Focus Ramon.
