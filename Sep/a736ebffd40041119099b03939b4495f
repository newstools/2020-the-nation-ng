The National President of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), Rev. Felix Omobude, has advised Edo State residents to maintain peace before, during and after tomorrow’s governorship election. Omobude, who is also the General Superintendent of Gospel Light International Ministry (GLIM)/New Covenant Gospel Church (NCGC), in an online statement by his media aide, Deacon Ralph Okhiria, said the election of a politician was not worth the blood or life of any resident. He said: “My dear good people of Edo State, I identify and join my voice to the many other good citizens of the state to call for peace during this governorship election scheduled for Saturday. “The contestants have traversed the length and breadth of the state and have told us what they intend to do and can do. It is now our duty to make our choices and then come out boldly to exercise our franchise. “I enjoin you to do what is right. Don’t give yourself to violence. Do not allow your children to be used for violent activities. While voting, don’t sell your conscience. Stand for what is right and the overall interest and development of our great state. “Election is a period to reward good with our votes and also a period to punish evil with our Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs). “Our politicians should be more circumspect in their utterances and activities, by ensuring that they put Edo State first in their activities. They should not let their ambitions blindfold them or override the peace of the state. It is important that politicians do not destroy the state and the people they aspire to govern.”
