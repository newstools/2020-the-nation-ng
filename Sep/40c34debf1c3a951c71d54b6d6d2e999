Governor Godwin Obaseki has expressed his displeasure over the electoral conduct of the Independent National Electoral Commission, (INEC) in the ongoing Edo gubernatorial election. After casting his vote at polling unit 19, ward 4, Oredo local government area of the state, Obaseki, who is also the People’s Democratic Party, PDP, complained about the delay experienced in the voting exercise. The governor said he expected a better planning by the electoral commission. “I expected that INEC would have prepared better for this election. I waited for one and half hours on the queue before exercising my franchise, it’s a beat disappointing,” he said. “Giving that this is a sole day election, I expected a better planning for this election. Card readers were very slow and that’s the situation everywhere.”
