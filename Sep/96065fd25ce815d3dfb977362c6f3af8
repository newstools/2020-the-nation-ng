Identified structures housing the Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP) at Kaza along the Gulumba-Gana axis of Borno State have been levelled by Nigerian Military fighter jets. The operation conducted by the Air Task Force of the Operation Lafiya Dole, according to a statement by the Coordinator Defence Media Operations, Major General John Enenche, was sequel to credible intelligence on the activities of the terrorists. The statement read in part, “in continuation of the sustained offensive against criminal elements in the North East of the Country, the Air Task Force of Operation LAFIYA DOLE has eliminated some Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) terrorists and destroyed compounds housing them at Kaza along the Gulumba Gana – Kumshe axis of Borno State. “The air strike was executed on 1 September 2020 following credible Human Intelligence reports as well as confirmatory Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions indicating a resurgence of terrorists’ activities in the settlement. “The identified locations within the settlement were therefore attacked by fighter jets and helicopter gunships dispatched by the Air Task Force, resulting in the destruction of the structures and the neutralization of some of the ISWAP fighters.”
