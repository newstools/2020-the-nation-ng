 A former Secretary to the Ondo State Government (SSG), Ifedayo Abegunde, who resigned last month to support the aspiration of Chief Olusegun Abraham, has returned to join forces with Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu. Abegunde had said that Akeredolu would not win the party’s primaries because his administration lacked human face.  But Chief Abraham was the first to step down for Akeredolu before the party’s primary election. The former SSG was said to have met Governor Akeredolu on Sunday evening at the Government House, Akure. The pictures he took with Akeredolu’s son, Babajide and another APC chieftain where he displayed the four plus four sign after the meeting later flooded the social media.
