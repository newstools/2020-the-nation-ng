Beneficiaries of Sir Emeka Offor Foundation (SEOF) medical equipment and other supplies have been warned against sale or diversion of the materials. Founder of the organisation, Sir Emeka Offor, who gave the warning in Oraifite, Anambra State, during the foundation’s second phase empowerment project of donation of medical equipment worth billions of naira to 21 tertiary medical institutions, said culprits risked prosecution. Offor, represented by the Chief of Staff of the foundation, AIG Chris Ezike, said the warnings on profiteering from the donations was informed by past experiences, describing the caveat as precautionary to ensure beneficiaries did not feign ignorance. He said, “We are talking from two experiences, from issues of corporate governance and from history. When you’re making donations, especially when it’s free, it will be immoral and unethical for beneficiaries to make profits out of them. “Secondly, we learn from history. We’ve seen most items donated by UNICEF and WHO in the market where they’re being sold. It’s good to be precautious. If it’s not used for the intended purpose, it would hurt us morally.” “If we notice you’re diverting, you’ll be prosecuted. If you sell it, you’ll face the consequences of stealing. It’s punishable by our statute. Besides, giving such persons again will be farfetched. Offor further explained that the donations were informed by the founder’s vision of touching lives and improving the living conditions of the marginalised and impoverished Nigerians.
