The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has assured the National Youth Service Corp of corps members that will participate as volunteers in the forthcoming Senatorial bye-election in Bayelsa of their security and welfare before, during, and after the exercise. The Bayelsa State Resident Electoral Commissioner, Dr. Cyril Omorogbe, gave this assurance during a courtesy visit by NYSC delegation led by the State Coordinator, Mrs. Elizabeth Iyowuna. Recall that Bayelsa Central and West Senatorial Districts bye-elections have been slated for October 31. Iyowuna commended the synergy between NYSC and INEC, calling for a continuous mutual working relationship between the two organisations. The NYSC coordinator emphasized that the security/welfare of corps members that would serve as ad hoc staff during the electoral process would be given top priority. Iyowuna cautioned that corps members should not be posted to flashpoints. She said that corp members were faced with challenges during the last governorship election in the state. The state coordinator appealed to INEC to address such challenges before the forthcoming senatorial election. Iyowuna assured the REC of NYSC support in achieving free, fair, and credible by-election and other subsequent elections in the state.
