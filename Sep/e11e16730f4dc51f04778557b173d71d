The imminent sale of Sergio Reguilon to Tottenham Hotspur for a fee of around 30 million euros would take Real Madrid’s summer sales to a value exceeding 100 million euros, as the club have been forced to raise funds to help limit the impact of COVID-19 and fund the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu redevelopment. It was known prior to the summer transfer window that sales would be necessary in order to aid the club’s fiscal situation, and the obvious names of James Rodriguez and Gareth Bale were immediately linked with an exit. The situation surrounding Bale remains a complex one, but Los Blancos managed to find buyers for all of Rodriguez, Achraf Hakimi and Reguilon himself. Everton paid the Spanish giants a fee of 25 million euros for the Colombian, despite him only having a year left on his contract in the capital, with the total amount brought in this summer adding up to 119.5 million euros. Martin Odegaard is the only relatively new face to arrive back into the senior squad, as he was recalled early from his loan at Real Sociedad, but Florentino Perez has shown no appetite to move into the market to sign players. The first sale was that of Hakimi who went to Inter for 40 million euros, whilst Javi Sanchez, Dani Gomez and De Frutos all left for a combined 8.5 million. Takefusa Kubo’s loan to Villarreal came with a 2.5-million-euro loan fee, although there was to be no money received for the loans of Fran Garcia, Jesus Vallejo, Brahim Diaz and Reiner to Rayo Vallecano, Granada, AC Milan and Borussia Dortmund respectively. Oscar’s sale to Sevilla brought in 13.5 million euros, whilst the club continues to work on Bale’s departure on loan, which would save the club a significant sum in salary. Real Madrid are unlikely, almost guaranteed, not to purchase a new player this summer, but they are focused on the future. This intense campaign to raise funds will also go some way to helping them try and secure their most desire signing in 2021, Kylian Mbappe.
