Hundreds of youths on Friday held a rally in Osogbo, capital of Osun to canvass votes for 26-year-old BBNaija Housemate, Olamileken Agbeleshe aka Laycon. Ex-Osun Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Hon. Sunday Akere, joined the rally tagged #TeamLaycon. Akere, who led scores of youths in the rally, noted Laycon deserves massive votes from Nigerians because he displayed a high level of discipline since the show started. “Laycon is the symbol of Omoluabi, who has shown a high level of intelligence through his brilliancy and hard work. “Laycon is intelligent and has shown the best quality character you will want to see in young human being. “When he came into the house he said he has done some songs which people know but they did not know him as a person.”
