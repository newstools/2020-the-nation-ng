 A CHIEFTAIN of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Delta State, Chief Hyacinth Enuha, has urged his fellow Anioma people in Edo State to massively vote on Saturday for the governorship candidate of the APC, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu. He gave the advice on Tuesday in Benin, the Edo State capital, when he met with Anioma people. Enuha enjoined his people in Edo State to be concerned about who governs the state, thereby making it imperative for them to vote wisely for Ize-Iyamu, whom he assured, would give them a sense of belonging and protect their businesses and property in Edo State. He said since Edo and Delta states were together in the defunct Bendel State, the people of both states must continue to look over one another for mutual growth and benefits.
