 ALEX IWOBI has returned to the Everton squad ahead of their Premier League outing against West Bromwich Albion on Saturday after recovering from a knock. The 24-year-old was missing in Carlo Ancelotti’s team for their opening league fixture against Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, and their Carabao Cup triumph against Salford City on Wednesday. Ahead of the encounter against the Baggies at Goodison Park on Saturday, Ancelotti confirmed the Super Eagles star is among the players fit and ready to play following his recovery. Iwobi’s absence from Ancelotti’s squad in the last few days has ignited talk about his future on Merseyside after Everton’s spending spree this summer. The Nigeria international joined the Toffees from Arsenal for a fee of £40 million last August but the arrivals of Allan, James Rodriguez and Abdoulaye Doucoure means more competition for playing time in the middle of the park. Last season, he featured in 25 Premier League matches, including 19 starts, and he had a goal to his name.
