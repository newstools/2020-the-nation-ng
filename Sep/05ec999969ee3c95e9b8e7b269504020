 OGUN State Government has directed schools in the state to reopen on September 21 for the first term of 2020/2021 session. The government added that this was in addition to the earlier resumption of pupils in SS3, who are currently writing the West African School Certificate Examination. Kunle Somorin, Chief Press Secretary to Governor Dapo Abiodun, stressed that this second phase of the reopening of schools was extended to all classes in primary and secondary schools, technical and vocational colleges and tertiary institutions. He, however, noted that as part of the efforts to meet the COVID-19 guidelines for school operations, the schools hours have been staggered as follows for public schools: Primary 1 to primary 3 8.00am to 11.00am; Primary 4 to Primary 6 12.00noon to 3.00p.m; JSS 1 to JSS3 8.00a.m to 11.00a.m; SS1 to SS3 12.00noon to 3.00p.m; and technical and vocational will operate their normal school hours of 8.00a.m to 2.00p.m. Early Child Care Development and Education classes, for example: 3-5 years of age will not be resuming in public schools until the next phase of schoolsâ€™ reopening. Private schools are also expected to take necessary measures to meet the COVID-19 protocols for physical distancing, among other requirements. Tertiary institutions are allowed to begin reopening from September 21, as may be determined by their respective management. The government had earlier announced that pupils had been given an automatic promotion to the next class, including automatic placement for Primary 6 pupils in public primary schools into JSS1 of public secondary schools.
