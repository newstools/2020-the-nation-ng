 THE Chairman of the National Campaign Council of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the September 19 governorship election in Edo State, Chief Nyesom Wike, has urged the electorate to vote for Governor Godwin Obaseki and his deputy/running mate, Philip Shaibu, to end godfatherism in the state. Wike, the Governor of Rivers State, made the admonition yesterday at Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium, Benin, while ending PDPâ€™s campaigns with a mega rally. Grand finale of the rally was also attended by Governors Aminu Tambuwal (Sokoto) and Ifeanyi Okowa (Delta), as well as the National Chairman of PDP, Prince Uche Secondus; and a former governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi; among other dignitaries. Wike claimed that Obaseki had done his best in going round the 192 wards of Edo State to solicit the votes of residents, stressing that the large number of persons that attended the rally was an attestation that the Edo governor had done what he needed to do. With the mammoth crowd at the rally, the Rivers governor claimed that Obaseki had already won the election, asking the electorate to compel the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to announce the election result in favour of Governor Obaseki. Tambuwal asked Edo residents to protect their votes, saying they should not be intimidated or allowed themselves to be enticed by money to sell their votes. Okowa hailed Obaseki for moving round the 92 wards to campaign, hoping that he would emerge victorious on Saturday. Obi said voting for the Edo governor would guarantee the people of the state and the unborn generations a brighter future. Secondus urged lovers of democracy worldwide to ensure that Edo governorship election was free, fair and credible. Obaseki noted that his electioneering in the 192 wards opened his eyes to some of the challenges in the rural areas, which he promised to address in his second term. He appreciated the support of members and leaders of the PDP.
