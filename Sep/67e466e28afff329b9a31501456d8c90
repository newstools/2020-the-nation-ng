President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Amaju Pinnick has restated the Federation’s support for, and endorsement of, the Nigeria Pitch Awards as the seventh edition of the glamorous awards has now been moved to November in Asaba, Delta State. Speaking in Abuja yesterday, Pinnick extolled the assiduity, creativity and ingenuity that the organizers of the awards, Matchmakers Consult International Limited bring into the entire packaging of the event each year, while urging them to retain the laudable qualities and even improved upon for subsequent processes and ceremonies. “I am impressed by the hard work and transparency that the organizers of the Nigeria Pitch Awards bring into the process and organization of the ceremony each year. Despite a number of challenges and hurdles to cross over the years, they have never faltered in putting up an impressive show and more importantly, the integrity of the selections have been obvious to followers of the game,” the NFF boss said. Pinnick further assured the organizers that the NFF’s moral support for the awards remains intact and that the Federation’s top hierarchy would be ready to grace this year’s ceremony taking place in the Delta State capital in the second week of November. For the President of the Nigeria Pitch Awards, Shina Phillips, the integrity of the awards has been its major asset and that they would not compromise the high standards that have been second nature to the event over the years.
