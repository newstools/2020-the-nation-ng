Napoli will face a third friendly test on Friday 11 September against Pescara at San Paolo. On Sunday 13 September, the Azzurri will fly to Portugal for the luxury friendly Sporting Lisbon. Meanwhile, former sporting director of AC Milan Ariedo Braida has expressed surprise over the maturity of Osimhen  since joining Napoli on a record transfer from OSC Lille. The former Milan manager, told Tuttosport: “I know Osimhen well, but I am curious to see him in a different football than the French one, with less space. In general, you should never be in a hurry with the players. Not everyone matures at the same speed. Think of Bruno Fernandes: today he is the leader of Manchester United. “
