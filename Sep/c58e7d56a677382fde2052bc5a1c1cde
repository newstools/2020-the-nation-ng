There is need to fight fake news from all fronts to protect the works of genuine, hardworking journalists, a panel of experienced journalists has said. Youth and Sports Minister Sunday Dare, who set the tone for the discussion against fake news urged traditional or mainstream media to strengthen its gate-keeping role to combat fake news in Nigeria. Dare, as well as the other experienced journalists, spoke during a webinar, organised by the International Centre for Journalists (ICJ) and the International Centre for Investigative Reporting (ICIR) for fact-checking in information dissemination. The webinar, with the theme: Gaining Trust for the Media in the Fake News Era, was moderated by ICFJ Fellow and former The Nation reporter, Hannah Ajakaiye. An investigative journalist, Fisayo Soyombo; multimedia journalist, Ejiro Umokoro and ICIR Director, Dayo Aiyetan, were panelists at the event that was also attended by journalists and fact-checkers from various media houses. Dare said “The role of the journalist as a gatekeeper has, therefore, become more relevant in exploring the political, technological, and societal contexts of misinformation in Nigeria. “The social media environment in Nigeria has become even more toxic than the contentious atmosphere that Cambridge Analytica precipitated with its video in 2015. Successive general and local elections have seen an escalation in the deployment of fake news for launching attacks on opponents.”
