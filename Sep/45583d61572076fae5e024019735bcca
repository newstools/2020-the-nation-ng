 THE Court of Appeal in Abuja has upheld the conviction and sentencing of Apostle Basil Princewill for raping a 14-year-old girl and attempting to abort the resultant pregnancy. Justice Stephen Adah said on Tuesday that the appellate court found nothing wrong with the judgment given on June 25, 2019 by Justice Hussein Baba-Yusuf of the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Justice Baba-Yusuf had convicted and sentenced Princewill, Founder and General Overseer of the Mountain Mover Fire Ministry of International, Nyanya, Abuja to seven years for rape and five years for attempting to procure abortion. Justice Adah noted that the prosecution effectively discharged the burden of proof placed on it by the law. “Having gone through the record before the court and the argument of counsel to the parties, we found that the trial court did not do anything wrong in convicting the appellant and sentencing him to seven years,” he said.
