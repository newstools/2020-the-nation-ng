 THE International Organisation for Migration (IOM) has warned of expected increase in trafficking and irregular migration at post Coronavirus (COVID- 19) pandemic as a result of socio-economic pressure in some countries. This, it said, would make desperate migrants more susceptible to criminals. Mr. Franz Celestin, IOM Head of Mission in Nigeria, disclosed this in a virtual interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja yesterday. According to Celestin, the socio-economic pressure post COVID-19, will be so hard and will push a lot of people to migrate to countries with better economy as they always do. He explained that once the fear of the virus no longer existed and a vaccine was out and distributed, a lot of people would be on the move again.
