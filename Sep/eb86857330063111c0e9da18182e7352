Laycon and Nengi gave viewers so much fun as they danced to sweet tunes blaring from the speakers. The Housemates had embarked on a fun Friday night after completing their Betway Make A Difference presentation and task to external judges. Biggie gave the House access to the Garden fridge and also had the jacuzzi ready in time for the night’s fun. And as the Housemates settled to have fun for the night, Nengi and Laycon decided to give viewers a good show. The two threw caution into the wind as they danced together giving hints they probably have dance chemistry that needs to be studied. Already, fans are yearning for Nengi to feature in Laycon’s music video once they are both out of the House. It was one of those nights as the seven remaining Housemates screamed for joy and hurriedly grabbed drinks from the Guinness fridge.
