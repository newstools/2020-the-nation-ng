 AFRO-POP singer, Patrick Osagie Osakwe aka P.V.O. Lala, has said the shoes of late Afrobeat legend, Fela Anikulapo Kuti are too big to fill. In a brief chat, PVO Lala said, “His shoes are too big for anybody to step into (including his children) even 20 years after his death.” PVO Lala recently returned to the music scene with a new song, ‘Scam,’ after 20 years of concerted efforts to be refreshingly different in his music form.  ‘Scam,’ PVO Lala’s latest single, is an afro-pop genre delivered in unique passion solely geared towards alerting the masses who have always fallen prey to unending promises and fail of the politicians. The grey-bearded act maintained that with this militant form, “I have undoubtedly gotten to the unsuspecting masses, especially parents who may have been defrauded severally by the politicians now ready to defraud their children too. Enough of the politicians fooling the masses that is why I am alerting and warning parents to make sure they do not scam their children during these elections in some states.”
