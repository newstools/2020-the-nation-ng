The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Edo State has promised to restore the Benin City master plan, to ensure environmental sustainability. Governor Godwin Obaseki, the party’s standard-bearer in the September 19 governorship poll, made the promise on Thursday during a visit to the Enogie of Ukhiri-Eresoyen and the Enigies in council at Ikpoba-Okha Local Government. He said there was pressure in Benin City as a result of rapid urbanisation. Obaseki said this had brought about the growth of activities of Community Development Associations (CDAs), which resulted in the CDAs abusing land allocation system. He said the pressure would continue on a faster rate, adding that it was in view of this that the government decided to restore the Benin City master plan. The PDP candidate said this would forestall the adverse effect the pressure would have on the city in particular and the society at large. He said the restoration of the master plan would also help in erosion control in the locality as well as check environmental degradation. Obaseki noted that the population increase was frightening, as it had increased rapidly from half a million in the last 25 years to about two million people. “So our plan is for social development, job creation as well as peace and security. “By the grace of God, by the time we are leaving office in 2024, we would have left a plan of 30 years for successive administrations to define our future. “Our plan is to solicit your support and prayers as we campaign in your domain,” he said. The monarch had acknowledged and hailed the governor on his efforts to develop the state. He prayed for the candidate and urged him to go peacefully, as God would grant his heart desires.
