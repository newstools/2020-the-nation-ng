By Sampson Unamka Erica has explained what led to the dispute between her and Laycon in the House. She said: “I think it is when he started telling people I tried to kiss him, to my knowledge it only happened once and I was intoxicated, he knew that if not for the alcohol that wouldn’t have happened in the first place and he lied that I try to kiss him a couple of times, once is not a couple of times and he decided he didn’t want to talk to me anymore so I am wondering why he kept talking about me to different people and making me look bad.” She added: “I think the rift between me and Laycon can be fixed because to me I don’t even have any negative feelings towards Laycon . “One thing about me is whenever I am angry I just want to tell the person how I feel and within a few minutes it passes and I think I have done that over and over so I don’t have any grudges against Laycon.”
