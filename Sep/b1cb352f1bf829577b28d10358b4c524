Tottenham manager Jose Mourinho has played down speculation of a rift with star player Dele Alli. The Englishman is left out of the club’s squad as they travel to Lokomotiv Plovdiv for a Europa League qualifier. Spurs have a hectic schedule in the coming weeks due to European commitments, and Mourinho is merely rotating his squad. “I never saw a strong reaction from him. He’s a good boy,” said Mourinho to reporters. “He was quiet and sad but he was just one of many.” On his selection for the game, Mourinho added: “With two games the situation would be different. “With one match, one decision, everything is decided tomorrow. “I think it is a difficult match and we are going to give them the respect they deserve from us. We are going there knowing it is black or white, there is no other option, you win or lose, you are in or out.”
