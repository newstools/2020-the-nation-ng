Napoli winger Matteo Politano has urged fans not to expect too much from Victor  Osimhen but to be patient with Nigerian as he settles in Serie A. Napoli paid a club-record fee of 70 million Euros to Ligue 1 side Lille in July to secure the service of the striker. Just few days after joining the Italian side, the Nigeria international has displayed his abilities in front of goal when he bagged a hat-trick and assist in their pre-season game against L’Aquila Calcio. Politano has advised the Napoli supporters not to put pressure on the forward, considering he has not previously played in Italy. “Osimhen has great prospects, he’s a good guy and has to work calmly,” Politano told Sky Sport Italia. “You shouldn’t expect everything immediately, he comes from a championship that is different from the Italian one. “He has potential; it’s up to him to put it into action. We are happy to have him on the team and we will give him a hand. He has great ability. We should put him at ease.”
