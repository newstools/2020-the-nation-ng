Project Alert midweek took the ongoing Spotlight Initiative Project aimed at eliminating violence against women and girls to Lagos Island and Isolo. The community outreach, which had previously held in Yaba and Ikorodu, had men and women participating in separate sections. At the Lagos Island edition, which held at Isale-Eko Area Office Building of Lagos Island Local Government, Tuesday, participants were made to understand the basics of domestic violence and what constitutes sexual violence and rape. The facilitator, Osasu Edobor, said the highly interactive session was to enlighten participants, so that they can become aware and stand up for one another in the face of abuse. At the Isolo outreach held at Olokun Hall, Ishaga, Wednesday, facilitators Adeyemi Temidayo and Edodor, told the crowd of men (and women), which comprised artisans of different vocations, in clear terms that violence against women â€“ whether physical, financial or emotional, as well as un-consented sex in any form, whether in marriage or outside, is rape, against the law and not acceptable. The Spotlight Initiative Project is a programme of the United Nations and European Union.
