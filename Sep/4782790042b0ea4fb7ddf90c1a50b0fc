Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has promised to engage more Persons with Disability (PWDs) as ad hoc officials for the October 10 governorship election in Ondo State, if they meet requirements. It said there was need to sustain and interrogate issue of participation of PWDs in Nigeria’s electoral processes and proffer solutions that would ensure greater inclusion. The electoral body, however, said it was working hard towards accomplishment of success in the Ondo poll. Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) Rufus Akeju, who spoke in Akure when he hosted the Inclusive Friends Association (IFA), said inclusive elections would not be achieved without the accurate data of PWDs disaggregated by type. He said unavailability of disaggregated data of PWDs limited the commission’s plan for inclusive and effective participation of PWDs in the electoral process. Akeju noted that data on size, location, type, literacy level and gender of PWDs was needed to provide the required services effectively and efficiently. IFA Executive Director Grace Jerry said Nigerians with disabilities want to participate in the electoral and political processes of the country, as indicated in the previous elections. She called for removal of barriers to PWDs’ participation during the Ondo governorship elections, so that the country could witness a truly inclusive election. Grace said polling units should be made accessible to PWDs by using flat surface venues, adding that priority voting should also be made available to them and availability of Braille ballot guide among others.
