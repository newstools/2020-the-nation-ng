 What inspires your skits? I have been far away from home (Nigeria) for a while and also not been so consistent in the home videos scenario just made me think and believe that it’s an avenue to launch myself back into the industry by projecting some good works/ messages to my people and fans both at home and also across the Diaspora. I feel so glad and honoured whenever I see people appreciating my works. What do you aim to achieve with the skits? My aim is to make people believe in me through my God’s given talents and mostly to let my people/fans enjoy and feel me as a good Nollywood ambassador by actualising my visions through the smooth delivery of my good work to them for a positive orientations and also to be guided in every aspect of life for the purpose of humanity in order to create a better society for us all. Do you think you can compete with other skit makers who are based in Nigeria? To me, skits exhibition or acting is not a competition but I personally see it as a means of getting across to the people around you via your good work. Your good work will definitely get you rated by the people that sees or watches it. Your quality job will determine the level and the strength of your ability/ capabilities in this profession. What are some of the character traits you’ve picked from your mother? First and foremost, integrity is a very important factor or character I took after my mum. Dedication is next. Another characteristic is the natural talents/abilities which I believe is a divine mystery which I use to show through my concepts that comprises of creativity, acting, improvisation, dialogue and presentation. I love being humorous which I also picked from my mum’s characters because we always derive pleasures in doing some hilarious things by making people around us to laugh and be happy.
