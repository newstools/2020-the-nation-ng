The Osun State Government has sealed off an orphanage home identified as  Oroyemi Elizabeth Covenant Home and Care Centre in Ile-Ife for consistent violation of Child Right law. A statement by the Information Officer Ministry of  Women, Children and Socio Affairs, Aminat Adebare, stated that the orphanage home was operating unprofessionally,  operating in an untidy environment even as most children in their care were malnourished and exceeded the number approved by the Child Rights Law 2013 of the State among others. The Women, Children and Socio Affairs Commissioner, Barr Olubukola Olaboopo said the state is ready to give the Children the best education, nutritious meals required for healthy growth and shelter. She noted that the governor of the state, Mr Adegboyega Oyetola is aware of the plight of those children and has prioritised their welfare after they were rescued. “42 children, three adults, those with physical disabilities ,among whom is an undergraduate of Osun State Polytechnic, Iree were among those that we’re rescued. They were given food and other confectionaries before they were relocated in batches to various standard Orphanage centers across the State for best care. The Commissioner informed that prior to the closure of the Centre, the ministry had earlier set up an inspection team since five years ago led by the ministry’s director Administration and Supply, Mrs Kehinde Odediran to monitor the operation of the Centre and discovered that its operation negates the State of Osun Child’s Right Law 2013.
