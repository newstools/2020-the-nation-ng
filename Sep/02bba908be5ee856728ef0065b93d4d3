Laycon has lamented the number of girls left in the House after Lucy’s eviction and Erica’s disqualification last Sunday. He complained about the weather in the House saying it’s too cold for him despite being weather for two. He said this while discussing with Dora on Wednesday. “We need more women in the house, there are just three girls in the house how do we share them”, he said. “We have weather for two and no one to cuddle, unless we share one girl with two guys.” There just nine Housemates remaining made up of six males and three female. Dorathy remains the only unattached female Housemate.
