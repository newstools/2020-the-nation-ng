 A COVID-19 Incidence and Response Tracker and Dashboard has been unveiled to showcase the resource requirements across the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The dashboard was built through funding by the Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG), the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, the Nigeria Governors’ Forum and the Africa Initiative for Governance (AIG). Speaking at the unveiling, the NESG Chairman, Mr. Asue Ighodalo, said the dashboard would enable respective subnational governments, alongside the Federal Government and donors, identify needs and gaps that exist in three critical priority areas – testing; treatment, isolation and contact tracing and tracking. According to him, the dashboard will be an internet-enabled and a web-based application, which can be used on mobile devices, displaying national and state-by-state incidences – infections, recoveries and deaths. He said the dashboard will  showcase state-by-state resources, a back-end content management system for data entry to feed the front-end of the dashboard and serve as a collaborative platform for key stakeholders to input and share data on actual and projected resources that can activate a needs assessment for combating the pandemic. It will also enhance the decision-making process in the provision and deployment of resources through a front-end mapping of resource availability, requirements, and gaps. Director of AIG Mrs. Ofovwe Aig-Imoukhuede said the dashboard is a demonstration of what the public sector in partnership with the private sector are capable of achieving.
