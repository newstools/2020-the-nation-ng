 ERSTWHILE coach of Napoli , Gianni Di Marzio, believes  a player  with the status of  Nigeria  international  Victor Osimhen  should  automatically be in the starting line-up of any team based on his talents. The 21-year-old made a stirring debut last Saturday  coming on a  second half substitute  to help his side to an eventual  2-0 win over Parma. In an interview with  Radio Marte in Italy,  Marzio  noted that  Osimhen has the quality to wreck any team in the Serie A. “Osimhen is an excellent player who has certain characteristics. He is not only a counter attacker, he knows how to play the ball. , he opens up the spaces for you, he is good at pressing, he knows how to do one-two with his teammates and he is not selfish in always wanting to shoot,” he said. Speaking  ahead of this weekend’s tie against Genoa,  Marzio said: “Against Genoa Osimhen has to play from the beginning. “ I was surprised that in Parma,  he started from the bench. For me,  the Nigerian must always play. On Sunday Napoli will attack the I Rossoblù, paying attention to the counterattack, but in my opinion there is no parity, the blues will win.” Meanwhile, Osimhen’s agent, William D’Avila,  believes his player still has a lot to offer in the Serie A. “Osimhen has a good start, he showed what he can do or give, there is a good connection with his teammates,” D’Avila told Radio Kiss Kiss Napoli. “The question of the form is not important, whether it is 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1 is not important, he adapts to the game system because he wants to play and score the most goals.”
