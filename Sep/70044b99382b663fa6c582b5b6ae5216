DELTA State University Teaching Hospital (DELSUTH), Oghara, has been identified as a centre for multi-national research for treatment of people with COVID-19. Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR), in collaboration with Emory University at Atlanta in Georgia State, and New York University, both in United States, identified DELSUTH following its determination to embark on research. With this collaboration  DELSUTH, on August 18, received eight Modified Continuous Positive Air-way Pressure (C-PAP) machines (CircumVent) for a study on non-invasive oxygen delivery to patients with COVID-19. Also, Total E&P Nigeria in keeping to its promise, delivered a second ambulance bus to DELSUTH last month. General Manager of Total E&P Dr. Charles Ngergbar, had, on March 18, 2019, while delivering an ambulance bus promised that by June the following year, the company would deliver the second one. On August 3, Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) donated COVID-19 relief materials to DELSUTH. The items included two mobile X-ray machines, five ECG machines, two Dialysis machines, two Arterial Blood Gas Machines, two mobile ultrasound machines, few monitor, syringe drivers, infusion pumps, 30 wheel chairs, seven oxygen cylinders, few drugs and consumables for patients. DELSUTH’s Chief Medical Director Dr. Onome Ogueh, receiving the medical equipment and consumables, hailed the interventionist organisation for its kind gesture. He said DELSUTH would deliver world class health-care service to Nigerians. But, like the proverbial Oliver Twist, Ogueh appealed to well-meaning Nigerians and organisations to assist the hospital, as it incurs a lot of charitable expenses.
