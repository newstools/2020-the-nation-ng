A Commissioner in the board of Ondo Oil Producing Areas Development Commission (OSOPADEC), Chief Ilawole Bisi, has resigned his membership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ondo for the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP). Other APC chieftains that joined the ZLP Wednesday were Hon. Ggbadebo Odimayo, and Hon. Nicholas Akinbiola, who is a former council boss of Irele Local Government. Odimayoâ€™s defection was said to have been influenced by his former boss, Hon. Yemi Tadema Festus, a former Majority Leader of the Ondo State House of Assembly. Ilawe resigned his appointment on Wednesday before joining the ZLP.
