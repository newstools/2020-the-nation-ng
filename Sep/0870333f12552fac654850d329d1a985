 SENATOR representing Ondo Central Ayo Akinyelure has enjoined President Muhammadu Buhari to ensure that the coming governorship polls in Edo and Ondo states are peaceful, free, fair and credible. Akinyelure, at an interview in Abuja, urged the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC) not to use security forces to disenfranchise voters. He said stakeholders in the Nigerian project must work to ensure that the country is not thrown into chaos. Akinyelure, responding to a question about his assessment of the coming elections, said: “The Edo election is going to be a test case. The people will decide when they go to the polls. “But we urge President Buhari to ensure a free and fair election in Edo. “The ruling parties should not use soldiers to snatch ballot boxes. Let Nigerians exercise their franchise to elect who should be their governors in Ondo and Edo states. “Let Nigerians be given the free chance to assess the government in power. If the assessment is favourable, that is, if they score 60 or 70 per cent, they will vote them back to power. “But if the assessment is below the expectation of Nigerians, let Nigerians be allowed to choose their leaders. “We are all stakeholders in this country; we don’t want any leader or party to throw this country into chaos. Therefore, let there be free, fair and democratic election in the state. “The Edo election will show what 2023 general election will be like. Whether the ruling party will allow Nigerians to exercise their franchise. “The power of incumbency is very great, but we know the President to be a man that has the fear of God in his heart.”
