Benue State Government has approved Monday, September 21 for resumption of schools across the state. Commissioner for Education Prof. Dennis Ityavyar, while briefing reporters, said both public and private primary, secondary and tertiary institutions are to abide by the directive. He explained that the resumption is for the first term of 2020 and 2021 academic session, stressing that third term for other categories of pupils and students, except JSS 3 and SSS 3, had been cancelled, including payment of school fees. “Let me emphasise on the issue of school fees so that there is no confusion because if third term is cancelled, school fees for the term is also cancelled. But in the case of JSS 3 and SSS 3, parents are expected to pay their third term fees. However, those who have not done the third term, they don’t need to pay fees and this applies to private and public schools,” Ityavyar clarified. According to the commissioner, it was the collective decision of stakeholders in the education sector in the state that tertiary institutions be fumigated and COVID-19 protocols strictly observed. He stated that parents are to provide facemasks and hand sanitisers while school authorities provide handwashing facilities and monitor compliance with social distancing in terms of sitting arrangement. Ityavyar stated that schools with high population would have to operate morning and afternoon sessions to avoid congestion, stressing that strict monitoring would be carried out to ensure compliance.
