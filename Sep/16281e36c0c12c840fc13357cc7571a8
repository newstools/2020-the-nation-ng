Senate President Ahmad Lawan, on Thursday, condoled with the families of victims of a fuel tanker explosion in Lokoja on Wednesday. Lawan, according to a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Ola Awoniyi, in Abuja, expressed grief over the gruesome accident in which more than a score of people, including school children, were reported to have lost their lives or property. He said: “It is sad and totally unacceptable that such tragedy keeps recurring on our roads despite ample road safety regulations and enforcement personnel. “While we mourn those who have so unfortunately lost their lives and pray for the speedy recovery of those who are injured, the incident underscores the need for constant review of our road safety strategy and mechanism with a view to making them more effective in preventing carnage on our roads. “Significantly improving road safety in Nigeria is an urgent challenge for the relevant authorities and other stakeholders in our transport sector. We have to bring an end to the rampant carnage on our roads.” The Senate President also extended his condolences to the government and people of Kogi State over the tragic incident.
