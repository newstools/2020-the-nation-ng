Nengi has drawn the line between herself and Ozo. She has continued to remind him that they are just friends and nothing more. Nengi, who is tired of Ozo’s constant request for a kiss, told the two-time Head of House they can never do things lovers do. The ex-beauty queen reminded Ozo that they are not in a relationship. “I have said it countless times we are not in a relationship, so we can’t do what people in a relationship do. “I know we are not making out but you want all this kissing and stuff and I can’t do it. “I am not joking about what I said we are not in a relationship. “Holding hands with you is fine, giving you hugs is fine but kissing you is totally out of it,” she said.
