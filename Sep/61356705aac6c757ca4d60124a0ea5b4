The legal trustee of the estate of late Madam Iyalode Efunroye Tinubu has urged the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Abubakar Adamu, to order the release of Taiwo Oyewunmi. He is detained at MAN Police Division, WEMABOD Estate, Ikeja, Lagos over a land dispute. Counsel for the trustee, Mr Kayode Bankole, described Oyewunmi’s arrest as illegal and an abuse of his fundamental rights. According to him, efforts by men of the State Criminal Intelligence and Investigation Department (SCIID) Panti-Yaba, Lagos to secure a remand order failed, yet the Police arrested Oyewunmi. The lawyer said Chief Magistrate Patrick Nwaka rejected a remand application by the police on the ground that the cause of the arrest is a civil case. Bankole said Oyewunmi is a Registered Trustee to late Madam Efunroye Tinubu’s estate and was arrested along with his 14-year-old son.  They were arraigned before a Yaba Chief Magistrate Court, Lagos, but Chief Magistrate Nwaka refused the prosecution’s application to remand him, saying the court would not allow itself to be used as an instrument of victimisation. The lawyer said: “The matter is before Justice Lawal of the Lagos High Court in suit number LD/165/2012, yet the Police went to arrest Taiwo Oyewunmi. He was arrested in a commando-like operation. “They also arrested his 14 years old son, a secondary schoolboy. The Police confiscated his telephone and they were handcuffed and paraded on the street like common criminals.” He stated that Police legal advice issued on the matter before the court and that Police must not be used to intimidate others. The land in dispute forms part of the vast land of late madam Iyalode Tinubu at Alaka Surulere, measuring approximately 53.126 hectares, as shown in survey plan No- AOP12125/010/2015/LA.
