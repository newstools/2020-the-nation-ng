The All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate for the Lagos East District by-election, Tokunbo Abiru, said yesterday that he would pursue fiscal federalism along with other legislators, if elected. The former Managing Director of Polaris Bank spoke during a meeting with party elders, community leaders and residents in Ibeju-Lekki. He said fiscal federalism was indispensable to national progress, adding that it would empower the states and promote even development. Abiru said: “I will team up with other lawmakers to ensure fiscal federalism in Nigeria. As federating units, our states cannot be viable with the current fiscal structure. “There is need for review within the ambit of the existing legal framework to institutionalise fiscal federalism, with a view to encouraging healthy competition among states to promote even development. “With the ongoing constitutional review, I will exploit this window of opportunity to push for a new fiscal federalism regime.” Abiru also said he would work with other federal lawmakers from Lagos to secure a special status for the state. He said Lagos is facing enormous pressure as a former federal capital, noting that a special status would enable it to attract more federal presence.
