Rangers International F.C have  announced the postponement its  resumption date for new players ahead of  the 2020/2021 league season. The club’s  G.M/CEO, Prince Owumi, stated that the postponement became necessary due largely to the current announcement from NCDC/PTF over the Covid-19 health protocols. “We are a law-abiding institution and will in no way flaunt laws put in place by a well-constituted government body like NCDC and PTF,” stated  Owumi. The earlier information at our disposal made us make our earlier announcement for our players to return but with further clarifications from NCDC and PTF, we are compelled to direct our players against returning to the players’ camp. “When we get clearance, they will be informed of when to return,” he added.
