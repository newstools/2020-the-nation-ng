 ANOTHER commissioner in the Governor Godwin Obaseki administration yesterday resigned, making him the third commissioner to do so. The resignation occurred 10 days to the September 19 election. Mr. Joseph Ikpea, the commissioner for Minerals, Oil and Gas, resigned his appointment and moved to his Ubiaja hometown in Esan Southeast Local Government where he returned to the All Progressives Congress (APC) and joined other members to celebrate his return to the party. The first two commissioners who recently resigned are Paul Ohonbamu (Communication and Orientation) and Ms. Omua Oni-Okpaku (Environment and Sustainability). Ikpea, in his resignation letter dated September 9 and addressed to Governor Obaseki of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), cited trust, respect and interest as responsible for his calling it quits. He said he found it very difficult to abandon the APC, which, according to him, he helped to nurture in his local government and at the state level. The commissioner said: “Politics is all about interest, trust and respect for one another, but I have never seen any of these to date. “The party that is known today as the APC was brought to Esan Southeast Local Government by me and over 90 per cent of my supporters are APC members to date. “So, it is difficult for me to leave the house I have built, considering also that Obaseki’s administration did not recognise my leadership role. “I will always be available to provide support to the Obaseki government, whenever I am called upon to do so.” Our reporter gathered yesterday in Benin that more commissioners and top officials of the Obaseki administration may resign before the election.
