Ebeano is Chimaraoke Nnamani, Ebeano is Sullivan Chime and Ebeano is Sullivan Chime, Ebeano is Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, these are ambassadors of Enugu Dream and in a dream people interpret it the way they understand. Chimaraoke Nnamani came and interpreted this dream for Enugu, Sullivan interpreted the dream the way he understands it . “Ifeanyi  Ugwuanyi is the present leader and ambassador of Ebeano, a leader of urban renewal, a leader who is master of infrastructure, a leader who is in peace with his people, a man who practices total inclusiveness and total forgiveness. The Saturday event is to solidarize with one of us that has represented us well and he is an ambassador of what we represent and we want to go and say that for being part of that Enugu dream, we thank you for interpreting that dream to the satisfaction of Enugu people.”
