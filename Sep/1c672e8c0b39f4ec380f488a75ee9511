A group under the auspices of Edo Community Leaders in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and security operatives to abide by the law ahead of Saturday’s election. It said due diligence will further ensure peaceful conduct of the September 19 governorship poll. The President of the Edo Community Leaders in the FCT, Dickson Omoregie, briefing reporters in Abuja, also enjoined politicians in Edo State to eschew violence and embrace peace. He said: “As stakeholders, we have been following the build ups and developments as we approach the election date and are worried about the arbitrary divisions of our state by politicians along partisan divides, with little or no respect for pre-existing historic, cultural, social and political groupings, which may further complicate the state of community cohesion and task of post-election sustainable development. “We will like to thank our royal father and the Chairman of the Edo State Traditional Council, the Oba of Benin, Oba Ewuare II, for his wise and timely counsel to the parties, contestants and their supporters across political divides, which set the tone for this news conference, which is primarily centred on the need for a peaceful and well administered election across the state, despite the inflammatory and aggressive rhetoric during campaigns.
