Ozo has revealed why he started ignoring his love interest, Nengi. Ozo, who is fond of Nengi, started keeping his distance after the eighth Sunday night eviction show. His new attitude towards Nengi got her worried that she shed tears during her diary session on Monday. However, while discussing with Vee, Ozo said he changed his attitude toward Nengi because she didn’t congratulate him for surviving eviction on Sunday. He said: “I am so pissed at Nengi, I had my bath, talked with Dorathy for a while, Nengi came in and saw us talking and she dropped the pictures of me that I gave to her on my bed and didn’t speak to me again”.
