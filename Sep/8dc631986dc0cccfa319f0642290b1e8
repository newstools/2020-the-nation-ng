 CHAIRMAN of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Anambra State Ndubuisi Nwobu has promised that the primaries will be credible. Nwobu, who addressed reporters yesterday in Awka, said 12 persons had shown interest to contest for governor. He urged the aspirants to woo delegates. Nwobi said the primaries would be keenly contested because of the calibre of persons interested in Governor Willie Obiano’s seat The aspirants include Obiora Okonkwo; Chris Azubogu; Valentine Ozigbo; Ike Oligbo; Uche Ekwunife and Chuma Nzeribe. Others are Ugochukwu Okeke; Ifedi Okwenna; Emeka Etiaba (SAN); Godwin Maduka and Godwin Ezeemo. Nwobu maintained nobody would get preferential treatment, saying they should discuss with delegates, not the executive. “If we get it right during the primaries, we would pursue the party in power out of the Government House and God willing it will happen,” he added.
