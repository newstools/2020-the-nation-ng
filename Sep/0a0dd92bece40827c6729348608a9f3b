 POLICE Station guard during the April 5, 2018 Offa, Kwara State, armed robbery incident, Sergeant Sulaiman Mahmoud on Tuesday said the robbers shot dead the armoury officer of the Offa police division Oke Kayode in his sleep. Giving his testimony at the High Court, Mahmoud said the armoury officer was on medication and sleeping in his office when the robbers struck about 4:45 pm. Mahmoud said that he lost his AK 47 rifle during the incident, adding that the gun dropped he was jumping over police station fence to escape the superior firepower of the hoodlums. “I was at the entrance of the police station when I suddenly heard gunshots from Captain Cook Junction. I ran into the police station shouting to alert others that armed robbers were approaching our station. I ran for cover shooting to scare the robbers away. “Suddenly, my gun got hooked and no one to assist me. I ran into the escape route of the station with my rifle. As I was about scaling the fence, my rifle fell off me and I couldn’t go back to retrieve it as the armed robbers already took the station. After the shooting subsided, I came back to meet my colleagues crying. I went to the place where my rifle fell off me, but I didn’t see it again,” he said. Mahmoud also said during cross-examination by the defence counsel, Mathias Emeribe, that Inspector Kayode Oke was killed in his office while sleeping as he was on medication for an illness.
