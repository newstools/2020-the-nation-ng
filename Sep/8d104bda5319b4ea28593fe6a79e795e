I am a team player, I love to play for everybody, and I think that’s what actually brought out my best. Omoh reiterated Hapoel Kfar Saba will spring lots of surprise victories against the dominating teams in the league. “We want to conquer Israel, Hapoel has good players that can deliver surprise victories, and I still want to believe that this team is good for trophies and advance stages this season,” he sounded off.
