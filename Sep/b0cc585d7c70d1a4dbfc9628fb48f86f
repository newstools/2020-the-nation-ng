Chelsea boss, Frank Lampard, has said they’re capable of beating defending Premier League champions, Liverpool. Lampard is relishing the prospect of playing Liverpool at Stamford Bridge, despite losing both encounters in 2019-20. The Blues did, however, win their FA Cup showdown and wants to show no fear hosting the champions on Sunday. Lampard claimed: “I am very excited. Liverpool were clearly the best team in the league last year, they won it by a long way. “But every game we played against them we really competed well. “We beat them in the FA Cup and lost pretty narrowly in both league games where we made a really good account of ourselves. “I’m excited for us to see how the players match up against them and see where we’re at. “We have some new players now, we are slightly short on fitness. I think our pre-season has been one of the hardest in the league. “Liverpool have been training a couple of weeks more than us, but what a great early opportunity to match up against them and see what we can do. “We have to be confident, we can’t fear Liverpool, we respect them, but we will believe in ourselves.”
