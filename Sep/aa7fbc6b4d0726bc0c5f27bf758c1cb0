Abia State Governor Okezie Ikpeazu has suspended the Executive Secretary of Aba Town Planning Authority, Mr. Okezie Ahutionye. The governor gave the order when he visited the site of a building which collapsed while under construction in Aba. He expressed his sadness over the incident, in which five people died. Ikpeazu expressed shock at the low quality of the materials used to build the three-storey building. The governor directed security agents to arrest the developer of the property and bring him to justice. He expressed his desire to meet with the family of the dead and directed the Ministry of Land, Planning and Survey to improve its supervision at construction sites. Ikpeazu condemned those who erect buildings without obtaining proper approvals, warning them to desist from such acts or face dire consequences. The governor was accompanied by his deputy, Ude Oko Chukwu, Acting Transition Council Chairman of Aba South Local Government Area, Evangelist Fred Aja Ogwo, and some other top government officials. Also, Governor Ikpeazu has appointed the Deputy General Manager of Abia State Environmental Protection Agency (ASEPA), Chief Roland Nwakanma, as the site coordinator of the search and recovery efforts of the government. Information Commissioner John Okiyi Kalu announced this while addressing reporters after the inauguration of the stateâ€™s Infectious Disease Hospital and COVID-19 treatment centre in Aba. He assured that the governor was directly supervising the recovery efforts and would ensure that anyone found culpable in the building collapse would be brought to justice.
