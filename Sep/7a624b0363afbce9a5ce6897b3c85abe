The queer drama with the above title has been on in Nasarawa State since last year. In case you missed the debut, it started with tales that Governor Abdullahi Sule and his predecessor Tanko Al-Makura, were at daggers-drawn over who should be nominated into President Muhammadu Buhari’s cabinet as minister. The rumour spread like wildfire while it lasted. Of course, the two political leaders denied it vehemently. The eventual emergence of Mohammed Hassan Abdullahi, former Secretary to the State Government (SSG) under Al-Makura, and a well-known ally of Sule, killed the tales. But long afterwards, Sule himself inadvertently sparked a new rumour of rift when he spoke of his readiness to serve one term as governor and leave for someone else. Trust rumour mongers, they went to town with his statement as evidence of a new face-off with the man who facilitated his first term. Again, the governor and Al-Makura dismissed talk of a rift. A couple of weeks ago, the two allies, while speaking when indigenes of Lafia Local Government Area visited Sule to thank him for appointing Aliyu Ubandoma as SSG, said their relationship was intact. But hardly had this declaration been aired than fresh claims, as usual unconfirmed, of a serious face-off between the two emerged. Findings by Sentry indicate that the new ‘disagreement’ may not be unconnected with allegations by some in the governor’s camp that Al-Makura may be grooming one of his aides as APC governorship candidate come 2023. Need I repeat that the governor and his predecessor have for the umpteenth time denied all the claims? So much ado about a governor, his predecessor and tale-bearers you will say.
