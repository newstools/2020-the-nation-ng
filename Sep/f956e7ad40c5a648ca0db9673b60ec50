In its efforts to address rape pandemic and gender based violence cases in the state, plans are underway by the state government to set up Gender Desk in the 57 local government areas and local council development areas. Speaking at the 6th Edition of the Women Assembly Forum held at Ikosi-Isheri  for Women in Kosofe, Ikeja and Ojodu LGs and Agboyi-Ketu, Onigbongbo, Ikosi-Isheri LCDAs, the Commissioner for Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation, Hon. (Mrs) Cecilia Dada pointed out that setting up the centers at the grassroots will help in containing gender based violence. While enjoining women on the need to be submissive to their husband, Dada urged them to be ready to speak up and speak out once their rights are being violated. According to Dada, women couldn’t speak up because they are unemployed when their rights are being violated. “You must be self reliant, gone are the days that women depend on their husband to do everything, no matter the level of provocation, control your temper, learn to be patient with your spouse, she warned. Lagos state government, Dada stated has zero tolerance to women who are unemployed.” That is why we have various skill acquisition centres all over the state ranging from short term of 4 weeks to long term of 6 months, all for free of charge, as women you must learn to work with your hands”, she said. So far over 17,000 women, girls and men have benefited from the free skills training and Start up packs by the state government” she added. On her part, the Mayoress Ikosi-Isheri lcda Princess Abolanle Bada lauded the Lagos state government initiative and added that the program will be replicated to the grassroots.
