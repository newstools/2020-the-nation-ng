No fewer than 105 men have benefited from the free screening for prostate cancer by the Rotary International District 9110 at its District Centre in Ikeja, Lagos. Each screening costs N4,200. Kicking off the event, Rotary International District 9110 Governor (DG), Bola Oyebade, said the event was held as part of activities to mark the World Prostate Cancer Awareness Month. He said similar programmes would follow later in some parts of the district that includes Ogun and Lagos states, stressing that the programme would run for the whole year. Noting that prostate cancer is a man killer disease, he urged Nigerians to avail themselves of the opportunity being provided by Rotary to know their status to enable them tackle it on time. The Districtâ€™s Prostate Cancer Committee, Benson Olusola, an Assistant Governor, said the organisation embarked on the programme when it discovered that many men did not know that they were prone to the disease. Describing the disease as a silent killer, he said many men keep it to themselves until it was too late to treat. He said it was not true that only adults are prone to it, adding that some young adults also have it. He said apart from the free screening, Rotary would offer free surgeries to 10 men found to have contracted the disease at N2.5 million, urging Nigerians with donations and others to make the drive a success. The guest speaker, Dr. Anjola Otoki, of Sebeccly and Support Centre, said as men got older, there is the risk of their contracting the disease. She advised men to embrace good food, keep physically active, and avoid cigarettes, among others, to reduce the risks. She also said early screening was vital to knowing if one has it or not. At a webinar, former Rotary District Governor in India, Dr. SVS Rao, said prostate cancer was one of the commonest cancers among men in Nigeria, and constituted 11 per cent with highest incidence of 182 in 100,000 among adults within 65 years in the Southwest of the country.
