 DEBUTANTS Gabriel and Willian impressed as Arsenal blew away promoted Fulham in the opening game of the Premier League season. Former Chelsea winger Willian had a hand in all three goals and Gabriel – a £23m signing from Lille – scored in his first game in English football. Arsenal were highly impressive, while Fulham caused themselves too many problems at the back. Both sides have played and won at Wembley – twice for the Gunners – in the 48 days since the last Premier League season finished. Alexandre Lacazette scored the opener from close range after Willian’s effort was saved.Centre-back Gabriel then scored from Willian’s corner with his shoulder. Willian, who also hit a post from a free-kick, picked out Pierre-Emerick Aubamayeng with a perfect cross-field ball and the captain curled home Arsenal’s third.
