Newly-promoted Leeds United continued their barnstorming return to the English Premier League (EPL) as they claimed their first points with a thrilling 4-3 win over Fulham at Elland Road on Saturday. After a 4-3 loss to champions Liverpool on an opening day, Leeds United, back in the top flight after a 16-year absence, produced more vibrant attacking football along with defensive jitters. Helda Costa gave them a flying start, only for Aleksandar Mitrovic’s penalty kick to level for Fulham, before Mateusz Klich restored their lead also with a penalty kick before half-time. Patrick Bamford’s clinical finish in the 50th minute gave Leeds United breathing space and Costa’s sumptuous second goal of the game six minutes later had them running riot. But Scott Parker’s Fulham, promoted via the play-offs, were far from finished as goals by substitute Bobby Decordova-Reid and Mitrovic in quick succession kept the result in the balance. With the game being played at a punishing high tempo, Leeds United lived dangerously at times, but they hung on for their first top-flight victory since April 2004. Like Leeds United, Fulham’s style was easy on the eye but Parker’s side now has no points from two games, having conceded seven. (Reuters/NAN)
