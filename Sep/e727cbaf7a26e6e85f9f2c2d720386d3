Osagie Otabor, Akure  THE Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) said it has replaced the over 5,000 card readers that got burnt at its Akure office last month. Chairman Prof Mammud Yakubu, speaking with reporters on Wednesday in Akure during his three-day working visit to the state, said he was in Ondo State to have an on-the-spot assessment of the level of preparedness for the October 10 governorship election. He said the electoral body would conduct a credible and acceptable poll as it did in Edo State last Saturday. Yakubu said the card readers had been configured ahead of the election. Said he: “We have already recovered some smart card readers. We unfortunately lost over 5,000 smart card readers to the fire. We have, however, recovered by getting requisite number of smart card readers from neighbouring Oyo State. “They have been delivered to Ondo State and they have been charged, configured and ready for the election on October 10.” Yakubu said INEC would organise an interaction session with stakeholders, including monarchs, to ensure the success of the election.
