 AN Islamic teacher, Ismaila Saheed, has been taken into custody charged with defiling a 15-year-old girl in Ogun State. Saheed, 38, and one Toliha Sabith, 20, were arrested by detectives at the weekend after the victim claimed that the pair raped her in Mowe area of the state. The teenager reported that Sabith first raped her before her Arabic instructor also took his turn on her. “She said she was raped by Sabith and she went to her Islamic and Arabic teacher to tell him about it. Having listened to her ordeal, the Arabic teacher Ismaila Saheed told her that she might have gotten pregnant as a result of the incident and he offered to help her remove the said pregnancy. Surprisingly, instead of removing the imaginary pregnancy, he also had carnal knowledge of her, after which he inserted a sharp object into her private part causing her a serious vaginal injury,” said police spokesman Abimbola Oyeyemi in a statement on Monday. They would be transferred to the Anti-Human Trafficking and Child Labour unit of the State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID) for further action, while the victim has been admitted in hospital for proper care.
