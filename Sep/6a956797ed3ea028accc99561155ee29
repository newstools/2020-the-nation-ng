 FABINGHA Simeon and Morgans Agagaowei, headteacher and deputy at Epie National High School in Kpansia, Bayelsa State, have been suspended for absenteeism. Commissioner for Education Gentle Emelah ordered their suspension when he visited the school on Tuesday. The commissioner also visited Bishop Dimieari Grammar School. Emelah said it was improper that the two officials would abscond from work, especially during examination. He directed a senior teacher, Mrs. Dakolo Timinipre, to run the school until further notice. He said: “I was at ENHS and the principal and vice principal were not on ground. I have suspended them while we look into their case.”
