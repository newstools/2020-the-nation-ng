The Osun State Government has sealed off an orphanage home identified as Oroyemi Elizabeth Covenant Home and Care Centre in Ile-Ife for consistent violation of Child Right law. A statement by the Information Officer Ministry of Women, Children and Socio Affairs, Aminat Adebare, stated that the orphanage home was operating unprofessionally, operating in an untidy environment even as most children in their care were malnourished and exceeded the number approved by the Child Right Law 2013 of the State among others. The Women, Children, and Socio Affairs commissioner, Barr Olubukola Olaboopo said the state is ready to give the children the best education, nutritious meals required for Healthy growth and shelter. She noted that the governor of the state, Mr. Adegboyega Oyetola is aware of the plight of those children and has prioritise their welfare after they were rescued. “42 children, three adults, those with physical disabilities, among whom is an undergraduate of Osun State Polytechnic, Iree were among those that were rescued. They were given food and other confectionaries before they were relocated in batches to various standard Orphanage centers across the State for the best care.” The women children and Socio Affairs Commissioner stressed further that prior to the closure of the Centre, the ministry had earlier set up an inspection team since five years ago led by the ministry’s director Administration and Supply, Mrs. Kehinde Odediran to monitor the operation of the Centre and discovered that its operation negates the State of Osun Child’s Right Law 2013. Mrs. Olaboopo while urging the orphanage operators in the state to ensure they fulfill the statutory obligations and operate within the ambit of the law. She disclosed further that the closure will deter others and advised parents and guardians to keep an eagle eye on their wards and take adequate care of them.
