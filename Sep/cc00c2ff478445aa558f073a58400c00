A teenage trader whose identity could not be ascertained reportedly got drowned at the Ochanja market round-about axis in Onitsha, Anambra state. The deceased was said to have been washed away by the ravaging flood following heavy downpour in the area. The Nation gathered that the deceased got drowned while attempting to cross over the deep drainage through the help of a plank that served as a bridge. An eye witness who identified himself as Ifejiofor blamed the victim, saying he would have waited for the rain to subside before going home. He said, “Immediately he stepped on the plank used to cross the gutter between the shop and the road, the plank broke and he fell into the deep gutter. “He was washed away by the speeding flood to the Nwangene River. If he had waited for the rain to subside before stepping out of the shop, he wouldn’t have died.” He however said efforts by passers-by who defied the rain to rescue the deceased were unsuccessful as the body was carried away by the ravaging flood. The Nation further learned that a search party comprising traders and some motorists who went the extra mile to rescue the body returned empty-handed.
