General Manager of 3SC, Rasheed Balogun found it hard to speak when the news of Ajibade Babalade’s death was broken to him. “The news of Kunde’s death was shocking and unbelievable.

Kunde contributed his own quota to making Shooting Stars a team to reckon with both in Nigeria and the continent of Africa.” According to Odegbami, “I send condolences to all generations of Nigerian footballers on the sudden passage of a great football warrior. May he journey and rest peacefully.” Babayaro said, “What a sad news, death what have we done to you. Kunde you have left us at this critical moment when we need you most.” According to Ajide the demise of Babalade is a reminder of the “our mortality and vanity of life fragility.”  Babalade was named the 3SC team manager in 2017, a post he held until his death.
