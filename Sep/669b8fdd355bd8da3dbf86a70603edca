Edo Governor, Godwin Obaseki has expressed disappointment at the conduct of the ongoing governorship election. Obaseki, who voted at his Polling Unit 19, Ward 4, Oredo Local Government Area (LGA), specifically faulted the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for inadequate preparations because of slow card reader. The Governor, who refused to be attended to as a VIP when he arrived the polling unit and went behind the queue, lamented he stayed on the queue for over 90 minutes. He said: “I expected that INEC would have prepared better for this election. I waited for one and half hour on the queue before exercising my franchise, it’s a bit disappointing. “Giving that this is a sole day election, I expected better planning. Card readers were very slow and that’s the situation everywhere.” His Special Adviser on Media and Communication, Crusoe Osagie, alleged tmanipulation in areas where Obaseki is popular. Osagie said: “Suddenly card readers are not working in areas where Governor Godwin Obaseki is very popular. Voters are being disenfranchised and we are constrained to say that this is sabotage. “Specifically, in Oredo Ward 1, Unit 20 and other places where the Governor is clearly popular, the card readers are not working. “The INEC should prove to Edo voters that it can conduct a credible election in Edo State.” However, the election has been generally peaceful in many parts of the metropolis save for few skirmishes. The Nation, who observed the process within the GRA and Sapele Road, noticed that party agents and hoodlums were canvassing votes openly. Some of them brought food to polling units to persuade voters while others shared money. Fights were also reported to have occurred in some of the voting centres.
