A man identified as William Madu was reportedly electrocuted in Sapele, Delta state. The Nation gathered that the incident occurred on Sunday afternoon, along Oleh Road in the timber town. 37-year old Madu was said to have gone to switch power over to electricity when the electrocution occurred. He was said to be the breadwinner of the family catering for his aged father and siblings. He reportedly worked with a water processing company before his demise. According to a source “William was watching TV when BEDC restored power supply and because the generator was outside, he left his one-room to switch off the generator set. “The next thing we heard was a little boy screaming. We dashed out to find him struggling with the wire and we had to switch off the power source of the building before we could rescue him”. It was further gathered that he died as he was been rushed to a hospital. His death has reportedly thrown the entire family into mourning, with the father currently devastated. The Delta State Police Command could not, however, confirm the incident when contacted. Its spokesperson, DSP Onome Onovwakpoyeya, said Monday, that the Police were not aware of the incident. “The DPO said there was no such thing,” she stated.
