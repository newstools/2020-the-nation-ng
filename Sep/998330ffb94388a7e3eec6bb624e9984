Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq has directed that snake bites be treated in all the state’s hospitals and the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital (UITH) free of charge. State Health Commissioner Razak Raji told reporters Wednesday in Ilorin, the state capital on the sideline of the presentation of 100-bed sets, medicines, and other medicaments to authorities of UITH by Sir Emeka Offor Foundation in partnership with Savannah Centre for Development, Diplomacy, and Democracy. Dr. Raji said “Just last week, Kwara state Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq donated several anti-snake venom vaccines to be used on patients of snake bite free. And we deployed such also to some of the state general hospitals. As I am talking to you now snakebite should be treated in the state free. “Either in teaching or general hospitals and the hospitals had acknowledged the receipt of the vaccines. “This development is very good even though coming from a foundation. We encourage other philanthropists and foundations to continue in this manner. So that patients will come here and utilize the facilities and have access to some of the free medications. The gesture is good for
Kwarans.”
