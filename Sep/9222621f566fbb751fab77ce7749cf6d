Vee and Laycon have weighed in on Ozo and Nengi’s relationship. They were seen discussing about Nengi and Ozo on Wednesday night. During their conversation, Vee was heard saying Nengi and Ozo’s relationship is bullshit because of how they follow each other during the day and sleep separately at night. “This is bullsh*t that Ozo is doing…,” Vee told Laycon. “They can’t stay away from each other for one hour,” Laycon replied. Vee continued: “It’s bullshit. They can’t stay away from each other during the day but they still sleep on different beds during the night.” With this, Laycon and Vee burst into laughter. Although Nengi has told Ozo they can only be friends and she sees him as a brother Ozo remains adamant about dating her.
