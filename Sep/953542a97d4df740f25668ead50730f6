The running mate of All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate, Mallam Gani Audu, has said he loves being underrated. He said his party would shock members of the Opposition on September 19 with victory. Audu, speaking in Benin at an interactive session with reporters, said: “I love being underrated. My strength lies in my ability to spring surprises. My people love me. It is obvious from all indications. “I have contested four elections, twice as a council chairman and twice as a lawmaker, and I have won the elections. I don’t engage in unnecessary arguments or fight. I have a listening ear and I accept good ideas that are brought forth.  “If you bring my attention to a problem you have, I will ensure you get a response that is helpful, a response that will lift your spirit. “The people churning out fake news that I am not accepted or relevant in my locality, a big shock awaits them on September 19. “I am accepted in my locality. APC is also accepted throughout Edo State. The massive votes the party will get in Edo North Senatorial District and other parts of the state will be a shocker to those doubting our victory.” Audu hoped that Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu would defeat Godwin Obaseki of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) by a landslide.
