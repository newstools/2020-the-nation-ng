Neo has pleaded with Nengi not to keep her distance from Ozo. Nengi has said she would stay away from Ozo so he doesn’t get another strike that makes leads to his disqualification. Neo said: ”Ozo is being himself by liking you so much. I understand your point but Ozo won’t be himself again if you insist on staying away from him. “Ozo really likes you and if you pull away it would affect him negatively. “It’s not all about winning the game but he’s also showing how caring he can be toward a woman he likes”.
