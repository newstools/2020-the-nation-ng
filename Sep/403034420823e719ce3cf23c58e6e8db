 A PAN Igbo sociopolitical organisation, Ndigbo Unity Forum (NUF), has lamented the neglect of the agriculture sub-sector across the southeast states within the past two decades. In a statement issued on behalf of the group by its Chairman, Augustine Chukwudum, a copy of which was made available to our correspondent, described as scandalous the enormous loss of revenue to the states within the region. In the statement which reads in part, the Forum said, “In the early sixties, it will be recalled that south east generated so much money from Agriculture that was used to developed old Eastern Region then, which everybody is still seeing the impact till today, but it is shameful that the governors of Southeast are not doing anything for the past twenty one years since the inspection of this fourth Republic in May 1999 to September 2020, despite been blessed with arable land that can produce food in commercial quantity our governors abandon the sector that can generate over $10bllion yearly and create more than seven million jobs if well harness. To address the challenge, the group maintained that there was need to encourage youths to embark on agriculture through creation of platforms that will make loans and grants easily accessible  Besides, the NUF further advised that there should be provision of improved seedlings and other agricultural related facilities like tractor, fertilizer and also increase money allocated to agric from zero percent as it is now to 70 percent.
