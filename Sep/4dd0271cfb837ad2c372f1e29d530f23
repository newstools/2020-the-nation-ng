Sacked Barcelona coach Quique Setien has indicated his readiness to take the Spanish giants to court. In a letter by the former Real Betis manager and his coaching staff, they announced they will take Barcelona to court. They claim the club failed to respect the contract the parties agreed on back in January when the 61-year-old replaced Ernesto Valverde. On August 17, the club announced that Setien and his staff were sacked. However, the former coach reveals that he’s been officially told by the club that he’ll be dismissed from his position only on September 16, one month later, via burofax. Barca wants to offer the coach another job at the club but Setien insists on getting paid the salary, as he’s got one more year left on his contract. It’s been reported that Ronald Koeman won’t be able to coach Barca during official matches until Barca solve their dispute with Quique.
