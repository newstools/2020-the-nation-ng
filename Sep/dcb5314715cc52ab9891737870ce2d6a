Laycon is worried about acceptance by the outside world when the Big Brother Naija Lockdown ends on Sunday. During a conversation with Nengi, he said he is scared of how people might troll him and those he loves. He said he is scared of social media trolls saying hurtful things to him and his loved ones when the show is over. He said: “I’m scared of trolls trying to say hurtful things about me and those I care about when we get out of here on Sunday.” Nengi however advised him not to pay attention to anybody. She said she’s used to being trolled. “I have developed a thick skin so negative words won’t affect me. I have been trolled before so it is not new to me,” said Nengi.
