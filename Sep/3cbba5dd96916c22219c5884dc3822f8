 CENTRE for Democracy and Development (CDD) has hailed the Oba of Benin, Ewuare II, for initiating the peace discussion which brought together major contestants in the September 19 governorship election in Edo State. Ms Idayat Hassan, director CDD, in a statement in Abuja, said the monarch took an important step to get the politicians to see the implications of their utterances and conduct. She said CDD praised the monarch for taking the decisive and patriotic step of getting the actors to reflect on, and rethink their actions, as well as the effects of their conduct on the electoral process. “The group notes that by lending his very weighty and influential voice to the task of de-escalating the tension in the state, the monarch has demonstrated astute leadership worthy of emulation by other monarchs across the state. “CDD commends the monarch for ensuring that the two major parties, which have been engaging in divisive, inciting and provocative rhetoric against each other, understand the damage they have been doing to peace and social order in the state. “What the monarch told them at that meeting is the same thing civil society has been shouting about since we started noticing the rise of political tension as a result of hate speech, verbal attacks among others. “It is clear that the political actors across board and the people of the state have immense respect for the monarch. “We are convinced that the message of peace, orderly conduct and sportsmanship, which was well articulated by the monarch, would get to not only the political leaders, but also reach party supporters and voters at the grassroots.”
