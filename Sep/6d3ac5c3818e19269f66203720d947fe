 THE newly appointed Executive Secretary/CEO of the National Institute for Cultural Orientation (NICO), Mallam Ado Mohammed Yahuza, has assured management and staff that he will work with everybody to ensure the institute sustained the achievements recorded over the past years. Yahuza, who made this known at the institute’s head office in Abuja upon resumption of office recently, said he is a team worker and not a chief executive who knows it all, hence the need to work together to leave a legacy for the institute. His words: “I believe my coming to NICO is to add value to whatever has been done here before my appointment and by the grace of God, with my wealth of experience as well as with your support, we will move the institute forward.” Apart from the statutory programmes, Yahuza, while canvassing for needed cooperation, said “the welfare of staff will remain an integral part of my policy.” Ado Yahuza also expressed his willingness to work closely with trade unions in the Institute, saying that no sensitive CEO will neglect unions. He commended the director overseeing the office before his appointment Mrs.Yerima and solicited for maximum support from Management and Staff of the institute Directors at the Institute took their turns to give goodwill messages, pledging their loyalty and commitment to the new Executive Secretary. Mallam Ado Yahuza, an astute administrator, obtained his first and second degrees from Ahmadu Bello University and University of Ibadan respectively.
