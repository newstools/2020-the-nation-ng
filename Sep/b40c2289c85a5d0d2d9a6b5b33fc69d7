Suspected thugs have invaded the premises of the Ondo State House of Assembly following a court ruling that squashed the suspension of four lawmakers. Those whose suspensions were lifted were Deputy Speaker Ogundeji Iroju, the only woman in the House, Mrs. Favour Tomomowo, Wale Williams and Tomide Akinribido. They were among the nine lawmakers who refused to sign impeachment notice against Deputy Governor Agboola Ajayi. The suspected thugs were stationed at strategic locations in the assembly complex Speaker Bamidele Oleyelogun, however, insisted that they were not thugs but members of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW). He said the NURTW members were on the Assembly premises for a meeting. Some lawmakers have, however, cried out over alleged plot to kill them. The legislators were suspended for alleged misconduct, but an Akure High Court reversed their suspension and ordered the Assembly to pay the three of them N15million. Deputy Speaker Ogundeji said they were helpless. He alleged: “NURTW members came to the House to kill us. They said we should not enter the Assembly to perform our constitutional legislative duties. “Right now, we are helpless because they are using government power against us. We are only relying on God to come to our aid.”
