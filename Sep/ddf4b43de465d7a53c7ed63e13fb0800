Two days to the governorship election in Edo, the atmosphere on the streets in Benin City, the state capital, is electric. Security has been deployed in several parts of the city ahead of the contest. It is evident that an important event is impending. For instance, the road that leads to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), where the sensitive materials that would be used for the election are being kept, have been cordoned off with traffic restricted to one part of the road. These developments, in addition to increasing floods caused by torrential rainfall in the city, has led to heavy traffic in different parts of the city. On Wednesday evening, a group of women spotting a uniform made from ankara fabric, were seen along Federal Avenue, GRA, Benin City, carrying bags with the logo of a particular political party. One of the passers-by on the street said they had just been mobilised to go out and canvass for votes in their respective areas. There is heavy vehicular movement on major roads in the capital city, particularly the Airport Road with the increasing influx of people into the state for the election.
