 THE Lagos State House of Assembly has called on Governor Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu to direct the Commissioners in the Ministries of Education, Information and Strategy, Youth and Social Development and other relevant agencies to embark on anti-drug campaign programmes in primary, secondary, tertiary schools in the state. Desmond Elliot (Surulere 1), who moved the motion, said during plenary on Monday: “The State Commissioner of Police should keep watch on the school environment. The Commissioner of Police should direct his men to ensure that there is no sale of drugs around school premises. We should also have anti-drug societies in schools. Parents are also called upon to keep watch on their children to reduce the usage of drugs in our society.“ Elliot said the House noted the increasing rate of drug abuse and alcohol consumption among students of secondary schools in the state, which is one of the problems affecting school-age teenagers. “It was observed that such experiment with drugs, alcohol and tobacco…started from elementary schools and reached peak in high schools  where its adverse effect is remarkably high on the students. “It was further observed that the unrestrained abuse of drugs, alcohol, tobacco and other prohibited drugs used by the students hinder the achievements of their educational attainment and leverage to vices such as gangsterism, gang-rape and cultism.”
