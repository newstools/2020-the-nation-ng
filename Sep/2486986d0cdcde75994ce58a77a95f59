 TWO governorship hopefuls on Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) platform – Obiora Okonkwo and Ifedi Okwenna – have said they want Governor Willie Obiano’s job in 2021 to lead the way for others to follow. Both spoke in Ogidi and Awka while declaring their intention to the people. Okonkwo said it was unfortunate things had not gone well in the state 29 years into its existence despite available resources. He promised to correct the anomalies, if given the opportunity. He said: “Let us creatively focus on our self-development and transformation, and let others see us as a model to copy. “Our peoples’ indomitable spirit is legendary, and if we could recover from effects of the Civil War in record time, there is nothing we cannot do if we put our minds to it. It just requires great leadership with its key attributes of a clear vision and a tenacious spirit. “Even more than leadership, democracy is about followership; an informed and attentive citizenry that strives to hold the leadership accountable; that insists on full complement of their constitutional rights and refuse to accept crumbs. “In the last 29 years, we have seen the best and the worst of our political leaders in Anambra, and as her 30th anniversary in 2021 coincides with the governorship election, we should all unite to reinvent, reinvigorate and revitalise her. “If it is the will of God, and should my party, PDP, find me worthy, I plan to present myself and, in unity, we will rebuild our state.” Okwenna, who was former Governor Peter Obi’s commissioner for Environment, regretted that Anambra had continued to slide since Obi left office. The governorship hopeful said he would take over from Obiano to replicate what people like the late Dr Michael Okpara, Chief Sam Mbakwe, Dr Chris Ngige and Peter Obi did in their era.
