Award-winning music star, Davido has returned to social media after a 97-day hiatus. Davido returned to Instagram and Twitter, three months after quitting the platforms to concentrate on completing his album and raising his family. Davido’s decision to quit social media for the duration was announced on June 3 by the singer, who wrote, “If you can’t reach me, don’t reach me, I’ll contact you. All my life, I have put people before me… I think it’s actually time I live my life and take care of myself… I have changed my number. I needed some cleansing to do, love y’all. I’d see you when I drop my ABT album.” Prior to the announcement, Davido acquired a property on highbrow Banana Island in Ikoyi, Lagos. The singer moved into the new home with his fiance and son, David Jr, after quitting his Lekki home.
