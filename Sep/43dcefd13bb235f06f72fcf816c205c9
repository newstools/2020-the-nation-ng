 EDO State Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Campaign Council has described as false and mischievous, an allegation that it plots to burn the office of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the state. The Chairman of Media and Publicity Sub-committee of the Campaign Council, Chris Osa Nehikhare, in a statement, said the claim is a fabrication by the All Progressives Congress (APC). He said: “We are amused by APC’s allegation of a plot to burn the INEC office in Edo State. The allegation is false and mischievous and should be disregarded. “What should be troubling and of serious concern to Edo people, local and international observers in the election, is the antic of the APC to accuse others of an action it intends to execute. There is a trail of this sort of accusation and we want the security agencies to take the accusation seriously, as we are concerned that the APC may do what it has just accused others of.”
