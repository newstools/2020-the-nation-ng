Edo Governor Godwin Obaseki is allegedly blackmailing teachers in the State to support his re-election campaign as canvassers or lose their salaries. A source in the education sector told The Nation the ‘Edo Teachers Mega Rally for Obaseki”, scheduled to hold in Benin City, the Edo State capital on Thursday, is being stage-managed by the Obaseki campaign organisation to give the impression that teachers are in support of his re-election. He said Governor Godwin Obaseki should leave Edo teachers alone because his Edo BEST educational policy has failed. The source added the state has recorded the worst results in common entrance examinations under the Governor in the last three and half years. A directive from the education authorities mandated all teachers to report at the State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB), the take-off point for the rally, with two passport photographs and permanent voters card (PVC) by 11.00am today. The memo reads in part: “This is to inform all teaching and non-teaching staff that the much-awaited rally is scheduled to take place in Benin City on September 9, 2020.” The directive also enjoined all teachers to come along with their “Edo BEST” blue T-shirt and their tabs while other categories of staff were also asked to come with their respective T-shirts and technological gadgets to grace the rally. The source condemned the domineering attitude of the state government in turning teachers into canvassers for the governor’s second term bid on PDP platform. Some of the teachers were spotted in Benin City close to the House of Assembly complex trying to put up an appearance in the heavy downpour.
