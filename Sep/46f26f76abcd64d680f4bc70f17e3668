No fewer than 55 young entrepreneurs and entertainers in Anambra State have received the sum of N2.7million from the GSS Group of Companies in support of their various businesses. Making the presentation on Friday in Awka, the firm’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Arc Chukwudi Ezenwa, said the gesture was informed by the untold hardships the entrepreneurs suffered while the COVID-19 pandemic lasted, resulting in closure of some of their businesses. He disclosed that N2million was to support 20 young entrepreneurs while a cash palliative of N20,000 each was disbursed to 35 entertainers in the state capital. He said, “We are aware that the entertainment sector suffered a great blow from the pandemic early this year as social events were brought to a halt, hence the need to support them. “Over 3000 persons applied for the grant on my social media handles where it was announced after which the applications were critically scrutinized to ensure transparency. “We didn’t just support the entertainers; we had a roundtable to discuss the future of entertainment in Anambra State. We have a whole lot of great business ideas from young persons but unfortunately, there is no financial support. “I’ve been through this hurdle and perfectly understand how funding can make or mar businesses, hence my decision to support these young people. It gives me great joy watching young businesses thrive,” he said. While commending the beneficiaries, Ezenwa urged them not to be deterred in their business growth but to focus on actualising their vision and dreams, just as he encouraged them to utilise the grant in giving their businesses the needed boost. He also called on the government and wealthy individuals to lend support to the young entrepreneurs.
