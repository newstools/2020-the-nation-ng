The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Edo has asked wife of Edo Deputy Governor, Mary-Ann Shaibu, to stop threatening violence ahead of the September 19 governorship election. APC, through its Media Campaign Council, in a statement by its Chairman, Prince John Mayaki, described Shaibu’s wife’s threat of violence against anyone associating with APC’s supporters, in a viral video as unfortunate. It said: “Mary-Ann Shaibu spat fire, threatening to flog any woman she sees associating with a group, which is suspected to be an affiliate of the APC in Edo State. “The threat violates the rights of Edo people, which grant them freedom to associate with anyone within the ambit of the law and the recent peace deal convoked by the Oba of Benin, Ewuare II. “Mrs. Shaibu was seen in the viral video gesticulating wildly and requesting that the photographs of all women attending the meeting she was addressing be captured, vowing afterwards that anyone of them found identifying with another group would be flogged with cane. “The sense of urgency and desperation in the tone of Mrs. Shaibu, who has been making frantic but futile moves to boost the chances of the temporary ruling party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), in Edo North Senatorial District, through meetings with women, are as a result of the chill wind reaching her. “Although, the women openly supported her to enjoy the pleasures they could derive, she realised they secretly intend to vote for APC’s governorship candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu.” Edo APC also urged its members and teeming supporters to massively vote for Ize-Iyamu on September 19 for good governance from November 12.
