African Democratic Congress (ADC) in Ondo State said it has increased its political enlightenment of the people following the victory of Governor Godwin Obaseki in Edo State. It said the enlightenment is to create awareness in the sub-consciousness of the people on the need to vote for candidates of their choice even when given financial inducement. The ADP said it has mobilised more canvassers for people in the rural areas as well as use radio programmes, fliers and billboards to reorient the people. The candidate of the party, Prince Dapo Adelegan, who spoke to our reporter in Akure, hoped that Ondo State people would take a cue from last Saturday’s governorship election in Edo State. He said the residents would vote for the candidate with economic agenda, capacity to deliver on good governance and vision like what happened in Edo State. Adelegan said: “I hope Ondo will take a cue from Edo election. Edo people voted for the work Obaseki has done. That election is the end of politics and beginning of governance. Despite vote buying, the people voted for a performing governor. “On our part, we have increased our enlightenment of the people by telling them to take their money and vote for the right candidate with the right economic agenda.”
