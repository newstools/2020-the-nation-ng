 Nigeria boxer Umar Sadiq would get a chance at his first world title when he faces Fedor Chudinov for the World Boxing Association (WBA) Gold super middleweight title in Russia tonight. Umar, who represented Nigeria at the 2016 Olympics qualifiers in Cameroon, accepted a late-notice fight with the Russian champion to be staged at Khimki Basketball Center, Khimki, a satellite city of Moscow. Umar,32, told boxingnewsonline: “This is simply a fight between Fedor Chudinov and I. So I asked myself and I asked my team, Can I beat him? ” The answer is yes, I can beat him. “Then we look at the reward- a place on the world stage and that is all I need to know. “Based on those two things, it was no brainer. I was like, yeah let’s do it! I stay ready all year round, so naturally I just took the fight,” Umar explained.
