Kiddwaya has dropped another bombshell for Erica, saying he connects better with Nengi. Erica is displeased with Kiddwaya and Nengi’s closeness, accusing the former of being disrespectful by talking to Nengi. During a conversation on Tuesday morning, Kidd told Erica he does not have anything in common with her because she’s from a different background. He further said he connects better with Nengi, Tolanibaj and Vee. “We don’t have anything in common. Don’t get it wrong, I mean this in terms of background and other things. “I have something in common with Nengi, Vee and Tolanibaj because we have almost the same experiences. “But you and I have similar personalities. I’m not going deep but when we have conversations, I connect with these people more.”
