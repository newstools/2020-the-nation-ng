FATE Foundation, which will be marking its 20th Anniversary, has reiterated its commitment to supporting and growing businesses for wealth creation and economic growth. The enterprise development organisation was founded by  Fola Adeola (founder and pioneer Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, GTBank) to harness the strong entrepreneurial culture of Nigerians by providing business incubation, growth enablement and accelerator support required to fully explore their innovative potential. FATE Foundation has since inception, supported over 120,000 aspiring and emerging Nigerian entrepreneurs spread across Nigeria creating jobs and adding value to the local and national economies. A number of these entrepreneurs are very active in the organisation’s vibrant Alumni community. Speaking on the Foundation’s work,  its Executive Director,  Adenike Adeyemi noted: “The mission of our organisation is to foster wealth creation by promoting business and entrepreneurial development among Nigerians.” In 2000, FATE Foundation started the Aspiring Entrepreneurs Programme (AEP) for young entrepreneurs/startups. This was followed by the launch of the Emerging Entrepreneurs Programme (EEP) for growing businesses and establishment of the FATE Consulting unit (now Growth support unit) to provide business support and advisory services for our entrepreneurs.
