 Leaders and elders of All Progressives Congress (APC) in Bayelsa State have accused Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) of promoting greed and marginalisation ahead of Bayelsa West by-election. The leaders, who met at Sagbama, said the PDP apologists promoting zoning had a mission to send Ekeremor Local Government into political wilderness. A communiqué  insisted  there was no zoning in the district. The leaders said political exigencies determined who occupied the senatorial position. They argued that if zoning had existed, the PDP candidate, Seriake Dickson, would not have obtained a senatorial form in 2007 when Sagbama, his local government, had served two consecutive terms. It was signed by the forum’s Chairman and former Acting Governor Nestor Binabo, and Secretary Gad Ombah.  According to them, it was disheartening that persons preaching zoning sealed their lips when Dickson took the deputy governorship to Sagbama after serving eight years as governor. They said: “The unwholesome zoning being advocated by some PDP leaders is an offshoot of avarice, greed, voraciousness and deep-seated hatred against the people of Ekeremor. PDP deliberately zoned all elective offices meant for the two councils, such as offices of the governor, deputy governor and Senate, to Sagbama, Dickson’s council. “This was further exacerbated by the level of insensitivity displayed by some self-seeking politicians, who abused the golden principles of fairness, equity and justice as they failed to consider that the people of Sagbama had served in the Senate for 14 years against the eight years of Ekeremor. “As members of Bayelsa West APC Leadership Forum, we have consulted our people, and we want to assuage ill-feelings by providing an acceptable balance that encourages fairness to ensure peaceful coexistence among the people of Bayelsa West Senatorial District.”
