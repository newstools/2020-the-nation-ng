Koeman reveals that he’s had a talk with Suarez in the morning before the Girona match. Meanwhile, it’s been reported that Luis could end up staying at Barca. “Luis Suarez and I spoke this morning about his future. We’re waiting to see if he stays or not. If he stays in the end, he will be part of the squad,” Ronald Koeman has told the media following Barca’s 3-1 win over Girona. According to the most recent rumours, Suarez could end up staying at Barca as his move to Juventus is getting less and less likely to happen. Meanwhile, the Uruguayan wasn’t included in the squads for the two pre-season matches. Since the very beginning of Koeman’s tenure at Camp Nou, the coach told Luis to find a new team.
