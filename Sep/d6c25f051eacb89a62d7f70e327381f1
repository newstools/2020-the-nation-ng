The Osun State Government on Wednesday closed a 220-bed isolation centre to manage COVID-19 patients. The government urged the citizens to take personal responsibility for their safety against the COVID-19 pandemic, irrespective of security measures being relaxed across the country. A statement by the Information and Civic Orientation Commissioner, Mrs. Funke Egbemode, announced the closure of Mercyland Isolation Centre. At the end of the week’s edition of the State Executive Council meeting, she said the state government would intensify the sensitisation of its citizens on the government and NCDC approved safety protocols, enjoining the citizens to take their adherence to the protocols seriously. “The government continues to worry about the level of non-compliance of its citizens to the COVID-19 safety protocols in the public space, with more people behaving like COVID-19 is no longer a reality. “Although the curve seems to be flattening in our state, it is important that we all acknowledge that the Osun State is not an island. Our land borders are opened and that means that people move in and out of the state every day, most of whose COVID-19 status cannot be ascertained,” the commissioner said.
