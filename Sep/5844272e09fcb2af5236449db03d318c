 SOULFUL singer, Alexandria Amede Chukwuma aka Taurie has said the Nigerian pop genre of music is unique. In an interview with The Nation, Taurie described her sound and what sets her apart from her contemporaries on the Nigerian music scene. “The Nigerian music scene is so unique on the world stage. It captures different musical arrangements that are not completely Afro-Pop and not so mainstream either which is why I don’t call it Afro-Pop. I call it Ni-Pop (Nigerian Pop) like K-Pop (Korean Pop) which keeps it as unique as it deserves to be.  “I want to take this moment to express that I am so honored and humbled to have this heritage of all places in the world. I thank my mother and family for that. I would say my genre follows soul, neo-soul, and R&B. I also have a flavor of mid-tempo dance. In terms of my Ni-Pop (Nigerian Pop) genre, I am still discovering it so I would say I am still mainstream in the Nigerian music culture. I’m still learning where I belong”, said Taurie. Taurie’s first album release in March 2020 is entitled ‘Enigma’. Her second album ‘Blossom’ was released in May 2020, she plans to drop her next single entitled ‘Heart Sings’ in September 2020. The singer rolls out a list of Nigerian artists who inspire her sound saying, “Tiwa Savage, Wiz Kid, and Burna Boy. I appreciate their contribution to the world stage of music, bringing Ni-Pop to global awareness, showcasing that the Nigerian music industry is alive and well, and thriving. I am still growing in this industry so I am still learning about other artists and how they inspire the rest of us.”
