Oyo State Government on Tuesday re-awarded the Saki township road for N4.796billion under the Alternative Project Funding Approach. The contract, which has an expected delivery period of 12 months, was revoked about two weeks ago by Governor Seyi Makinde when he went to the ancient town (Saki) to inaugurate a project. The re-award was part of decisions reached during the weekly state Executive Council meeting. Briefing reporters after the meeting, Education, Science and Technology Commissioner Mr. Olasunkanmi Olaleye said the 9.7km Saki township road was awarded in December 2016 by the last administration at a cost of N8.2billion, with a completion period of 18 months. He said the past government paid about N3billion to the contractor, adding that the work done at the site was, however, not commensurate with the money paid. Other decisions reached at the meeting included approval for the purchase of a modern fire-fighting truck for the Ibadan Airport, award of the Gedu-Oroki-Sabo-Ashipa road in Oyo town at a cost of N2.9 billion, as well as the passage of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources 2020 Bill to the House of Assembly.
