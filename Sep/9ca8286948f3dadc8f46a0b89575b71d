The Coalition of Democrats for Electoral Reforms (CODER) has listed conditions for a free and fair governorship election in Edo State. Its national coordinator, Temitope Shaba, and spokesman, Ayodele Adewale, told reporters in Benin-city, the state capital,the exercise will be peaceful and credible, if participants play by the rules of the game. CODER is accredited CSOs for the Edo poll. It   has been monitoring political developments in the state, particularly the trend of violence, vandalism or destruction of property associated with candidates, stock piling of small arms and light weapons and recruitment of armed thugs or militia groups. Shaba hailed the intervention of the Oba of Benin and the peace accord signed by candidates. He appealed to political actors in the two dominant political parties to sue for peace and allow the people to speak through the ballot. Shaba said: “The Nigerian Police Force and other security personnel on election duty must maintain their neutrality and be ready to arrest anyone that commits electoral offense. “INEC on the other hand must be seen to play its role as an unbiased umpire in the entire process to increase people’s confidence and trust in both the electoral process and the electoral management body. “CODER has mobilized 50 trained and duly accredited observers by INEC for Edo governorship election. “These observers will in turn oversee the activities of citizen observers across the 18 local government areas of Edo state earlier trained by CODER. “With this structure in place, CODER will provide real time updates on activities during the election and will stay in touch with INEC, Security agencies and other CSOs on online platforms for timely interventions where necessary.”
