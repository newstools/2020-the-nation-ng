The Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 pandemic has said it would be multiplying testing for the virus during a planned ‘testing week’, in commemoration of Nigeria’s 60th Independence Day Anniversary celebration. Chairman of the PTF and Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) Boss Mustapha, who stated this yesterday during the task force media briefing in Abuja, also appealed to Nigerians to be more vigilant at this time not to be infected despite the observed progress made in the national response. On the plan to have a testing week to mark the nation’s Diamond Anniversary, the SGF also said the task force would be intensifying risk communication and community engagement. “As we commence the activities marking 60th Independence Anniversary of our nation, the PTF is ramping up the risk communication and community engagement. Testing will be escalated under a national testing week programme, which the national coordinator will elaborate on,” he said. Mustapha also advised Christian and Muslim leaders to without fear or favour continue to prevail on their members to wear mask. Mustapha added that religious leaders and traditional rulers have a lot to do to curb the further spread of the pandemic. He said: “The best we can do for our people and our country is to adhere to these none pharmaceutical intervention that have been put in place. Wear your mask, observe social distancing, stay away from large crowd and if you have no business, don’t travel. “It is sad when people gather and they do not think it is appropriate to wear a mask. What we can do is to continue to appeal to our people that COVID-19 is still alive; it has not gone on any vacation.”
