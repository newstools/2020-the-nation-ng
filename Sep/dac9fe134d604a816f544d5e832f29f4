Current Head of House, Erica has expressed disrespect for her former bestie, Laycon. Laycon and Erica fell out of friendship when she turned him down after expressing his feelings for her. Erica, during a conversation with Kiddwaya, said she wouldn’t take it lightly with Laycon on Sunday if he answers any question by Ebuka concerning her. She told Kiddwaya that she has no iota of respect for the rapper, threatening to treat Laycon as though he doesn’t exist. “I will treat him as though he does not exist, let me see what he would be saying about me. “Next time, if Ebuka should ask a question and he has anything to say about me, I’m going to interrupt and insult him. “I’m going to tell him I’m not interested in any relationship with him. “He should just stop it. Everything he’s doing is making me lose the respect I had for him,” she stated.
