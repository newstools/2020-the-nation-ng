The Commandant-General, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) Muhammadu Gana has raised the alarm over the high rate of hard drug use in the northern part of the country. Gana called on Government through the National Institute for Cultural Orientation (NICO) to urgently intervene before the situation worsens. He spoke in Abuja at the opening ceremony of the 2nd edition of the Nigerian Indigenous Language in the Barracks, organised by NICO in collaboration with NSCDC. Gana said, “I want you to look into the issue of hard drugs like Codeine and others. The way people are consuming it now is alarming. The bad side of it is that both youth and old, especially women, are consuming these things. It is bad and NICO can please look into it.”
