 NIGERIA born British boxer Umar Sadiq says he is recovering well after being taken to hospital coughing up blood and requiring oxygen following his defeat to Fyodor Chudinov, according to reports from Russia. Sadiq reportedly fell ill immediately after his defeat by technical knockout in the fight in Khimki, near Moscow. And according to Russian outlet TASS, the 32-year-old super middleweight felt disorientated and was given immediate medical assistance by doctors minutes after the fight. Sadiq kissed the canvass just 40 seconds into the final round of the WBA gold belt fight, and that was his second defeat in a 12-fight career so far. The 32-year-old recorded six knockouts in 10 professional victories and has been preparing for the British title shot against Lerrone Richards. He was said to have consented to the fight at very short notice and gave a very good account of himself before succumbing in the last round.
