Speaking with reporters Tuesday in Awka, Nwobu, said the aspirants should discard the idea of knowing members of the Executive and concentrate on how to woo the party delegates in the State He said the primaries would be a keenly contested because of the calibre of Chieftains who had declared interest in Governor Willie Obiano’s seat The PDP Chairman mentioned the aspirants as Dr Obiora Okonkwo, Chris Azubogu, Valentine Ozigbo, Ike Oligbo, Uche Ekwunife and Chuma Nzeribe. Others, according to him were, Ugochukwu Okeke, Ifedi Okwenna, Emeka Etiaba SAN, Dr Godwin Maduka and Godwin Ezeemo. Nwobu, maintained that nobody is being giving preferential treatment among the contestants for the party’s ticket, adding that it was their duty to discuss with the delegates and not the Executive He frowned at the number of Court cases instituted numbering about eight by Party members in the State He added that they should follow the guidelines of the National Working Committee NWC by withdrawing such cases to move the party forward. “if we get it right during the primaries here which is why I’m working hard with my executive, we are going to chase out the current party in power out of government, and God’s willing, it will happen.”
