 THE Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has reassured the electorate in Edo State to expect nothing less than a free and credible poll on September 19. It said it would not be distracted by spurious allegations peddled by mischievous politicians from doing the right thing, “which is to conduct a free and fair election”. The assurance was given by the INEC National Chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, while fielding questions from reporters, shortly after swearing in a Resident Electoral Commissioner for Ekiti State, Tella Adeniran Rahmon, at the commission’s headquarters in Abuja. Yakubu said the commission would stand by its officials, irrespective of attempts by politicians to smear their reputations, which he noted had become the character of “these set of persons, any time elections are to be conducted.” He said: “Let me also say that we stand by our Resident Electoral Commissioners. We know the kind of job we are doing and all manner of people come with all manner of accusations to slander officials of the commission, essentially now to divert our attention from conducting elections in Nigeria. “We won’t be distracted; we know these shenanigans, people who have been doing this for a long time. It won’t distract us from doing the right thing. “My assurance to the people of Edo and Ondo states and the constituencies where we are going to conduct by-elections on October 31 is that they should expect from INEC, free, fair and credible elections. Professionalism will not be compromised. “We will not compromise our oath of office for any reason. Whoever the people vote for becomes the governor or representative.”
