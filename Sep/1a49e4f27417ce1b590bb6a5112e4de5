Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC) has urged the electorate to vote for the candidates of their choice, without fear or intimidation, during Saturday’s governorship election. IPAC, on Thursday in Benin, through its National Publicity Secretary, Agbo Major, said its members were in Edo State to sensitise the residents on the need for a peaceful election. It said: “We want our message of peace to get to the grassroots, so that the people can come out and vote for the candidates of their choice, without fear or intimidation. We have moved round the streets of Benin and its environs, giving out flyers to the people on the need for a peaceful governorship election. “What we want is a peaceful Edo State that will make progress after the election. “If you are out of Edo, you will think the state is at war, but since we arrived, we have found out that the people are peaceful, but resolute to vote in a free and fair environment.” IPAC’s Secretary-General Alhaji Yusuf Dantele called on the officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and security agents to remain neutral and be professional in the discharge of their responsibilities.
