A philanthropist in Edo State, Dion Osagie, has expressed optimism that tomorrow’s governorship election will be the most peaceful in the state. Osagie, on Thursday in Benin, in an interactive session with reporters, urged politicians not to see the poll as a do-or-die affair. He noted that with the intervention of the Oba of Benin, Ewuare II, who called on leaders of the major parties to give peace a chance before, during and after the election, the poll would be devoid of violence. Osagie said: “Edo State’s governorship poll is going to be the most peaceful election in the history of the state. There will be no violence or killing. The Oba of Benin stepped in and he advised the governorship candidates and other leaders of the parties to sheathe their swords and give peace a chance. “Edo residents should learn to see election as a game that must be played by its rules and should not be seen as war, because there will always be life after the election. “The Peoples Democratic Party’s (PDP’s) Governor Godwin Obaseki and the All Progressives Congress’ (APC’s) Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu should encourage their followers to give peace a chance. “We do not want to see bloodshed in Edo State’s 192 wards and across the 18 local governments. It is unfortunate that some people do not know how to respect the choices of others, which they rather see as a threat.” The philanthropist said there was the need to educate the people about the need to see election as a game of choice. He described voting as a democratic right that all eligible persons should participate in.
