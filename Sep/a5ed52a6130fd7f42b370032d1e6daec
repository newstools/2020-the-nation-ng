The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) on Sunday announced the inclusion of two new laboratories to its Molecular Laboratory Network for testing for COVID-19, across 35 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FTC). The labs are – Federal Medical Centre, GeneXpert Laboratory, Birnin Kebbi and Plateau State Human Virology Research Centre (PLASVIREC), Plateau. The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has activated 19 Emergency Communication Centres (ECCs) across the country to help track down distress calls relating to security issues and link callers with security agencies for support. Its Executive Vice Chairman, Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, who disclosed this at the weekend said over 1,500 COVID-19-related calls were received and processed through the centres at the peak of the pandemic. A statement by the Director of Public Affairs of the NCC, Dr. Ikechukwu Adinde, quoted Danbatta as saying that “during the total lockdown occasioned by the COVID 19 pandemic, the ECCs played a remarkable role by providing a platform for members of the public to seek live-saving information or support and reporting COVID-19 related cases by dialing 112 from any networks.
