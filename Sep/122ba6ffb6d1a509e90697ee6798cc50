The Lagos State Police Command has deployed 1,000 cops to Edo State ahead of Saturdayâ€™s governorship election. The deployment followed directive by the Inspector General of Police (IG) Mohammed Adamu for enhanced security before, during and after the elections in the state. IG Adamu had announced the deployment of 30,000 cops to be drawn from various commands and formations for the polls. The Nation had reported intelligence reports indicated politicians were arming and shipping thugs to Edo for possible violence, a development the IG warned against. Admonishing the Lagos contingent on Sunday, Commissioner of Police (CP) Hakeem Odumosu said they must exhibit utmost professionalism in the discharge of their duties. Odumosu, according to a statement by spokesman, Olumuyiwa Adejobi, reminded them the focus of the Police High Command was the sustenance of core democratic values through fair, free and credible elections. He assured their welfare has been approved by the IG, adding the package was morale booster for those deployed on the operation. Odumosu arranged clean, serviceable and executive buses to convey the personnel to Edo State with fully armed escort men. He urged them to protect their lives and property and do away with any act capable of denting the image of the police or that could truncate peaceful conduct of election in Edo State.
