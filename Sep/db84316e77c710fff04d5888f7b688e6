The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Edo has rejected the results of the governorship election, which gave victory to Governor Godwin Obaseki of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The party cited strong-arm tactics for the rejection. It declared there was foul play during the election, insisting the results were skewed in favour of Obaseki. Edo APC called on members and all lovers of democracy to stay calm, while leaders of the party would study the results and decide on the next line of action. In a statement by Chairman of its Media Campaign Council, Prince John Mayaki, the APC maintained the party’s governorship candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, was robbed of victory. It said: “Our people were arbitrarily arrested, many of the figures were fabricated. There was illicit tampering with results, to shore up PDP’s numbers and mark down APC’s. “Areas where we won, they cancelled the results. They decreased the votes in areas we had advantage. They rejected our results and jerked up theirs. “There was arbitrary arrest of local party members, who could have resisted the outrage, while Obaseki was busy diverting attention with false alarm. “Obaseki shouted that he was being rigged out and blamed the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) at the initial stage, but that was to divert attention from the evil going on in the field.” The party also thanked members of the party and teeming supporters of Ize-Iyamu for their support and steadfastness, which it said would never be taken for granted.
