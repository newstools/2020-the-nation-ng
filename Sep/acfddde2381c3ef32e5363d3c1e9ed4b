 IN keeping with the promise made by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the Lagos State government on Monday started rebuilding the fence damaged in the helicopter crash on Friday. The rebuilding followed  an integrity test carried out on the affected buildings. During his visit to the scene on Saturday, Sanwo-Olu assured owners of damaged properties that the state would  fix them. Director General, Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), Dr. Femi Oke-Osanyintolu said the area was also fumigated. He said: “The damaged fence is being reconstructed and the area has been fumigated. Integrity testing has been carried out on the affected buildings.”
