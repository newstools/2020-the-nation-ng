 KOGI State Governor Yahaya Bello called for urgent Federal Government’s attention to the deplorable condition of federal roads in the state. It was during his visit to Works  and Housing Minister Babatunde Fashola on Wednesday. The governor’s visit came at the wake of a fatal road accident involving a tanker and other vehicles on the Okene/Lokoja/Abuja road which resulted in an explosion that claimed over 20 lives in the Felele area, Lokoja yesterday. Bello said the deplorable state of all federal roads across the state had led to recurring accidents in the state. He said the state had done a lot in maintaining the roads but owing to the large volume of traffic on the roads, because of its strategic location as a gateway state, such repairs and maintenance do not stand the test of time. The governor appealed to the minister to expedite action in carrying out reconstruction of roads across the state to curtail the preventable accidents on the road. Fashola said he had directed the Federal Road Maintenance Agency to  move into action to fix bad portions at the Felele end of the Okene/Lokoja/Abuja road. The minister equally put calls across to contractors handling the Kabba-Egbe-Omuaro road, Okene-Lokoja-Abuja road to inform them of the governor’s presence in his office and the need for them to speed up the work. Fashola commiserated with the governor, people and government of Kogi State over the death of 25 victims on theLokoja road.
