A former governor of Adamawa State, Mr James Ngillari, yesterday dumped the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to join the All Progressives Congress (APC). The state Chairman of APC, Alhaji Ibrahim Bilal, said in Yola that the former governor switched camps with thousands of his supporters. He said the defection followed “long consultation.”  “He told me verbatim that his coming to APC is not to look for any position but to enjoy freedom of political aspiration,” Bilal said. The chairman said that the APC at National and state level is making arrangement to officially receive the former PDP governor and his supporters. He said that the party at the state level was closely in contact with the Mai Mala committee to strengthen the party ahead of the 2023 general elections.
