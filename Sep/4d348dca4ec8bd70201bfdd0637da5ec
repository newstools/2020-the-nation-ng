Olamilekan ‘Laycon’ Agbeleshe has emerged winner of the Big Brother Naija (BBNaija) season five reality TV show. He becomes the fifth winner of the show since its inception. On Sunday final eviction night, Laycon emerged winner after polling the highest votes of the five remaining housemates. The last five housemates were Laycon, Dorathy, Nengi, Vee, and Neo. Vee was the first housemate to leave the BBNaija house on Sunday night, while Neo and Nengi followed suit. Even though he was just an unrecognised upcoming singer before Big Brother, the 26-year-old rapper had big names like Tunde Ednut, Reminince and a host of other stars rooting for him. Some of these stars are Yinka Ayefele; popular blogger, TundeEdnut; actors Nkechi Blessing, Lateef Adedimeji, Olaniyi “Sanyeri” Afonja, Ufuoma McDermott; comedian Broda Shaggy and entertainer, Lekan KingKong among others. They all actively campaigned for him on their social media pages.

Following his victory, Laycon is expected to go home with N85m worth of prize.
