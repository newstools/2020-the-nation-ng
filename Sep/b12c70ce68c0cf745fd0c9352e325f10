Five persons were feared dead when a three-storey crashed on Wednesday in Aba, Abia State commercial centre. A civil engineer Leonard Eze described the building as a death trap and a disaster waiting to happen. “How can one use substandard materials and expect a miracle? Someone in government ought to be supervising these buildings,” he said. The state government has ordered a demolition of the structure. Commissioner for Information John Okiyi Kalu said the government “received with sadness news of the collapse of the three-storey building which was under construction…and Governor Okezie Ikpeazu immediately directed relevant agencies to the location as well as mobilised earth-moving equipment to the site on a search and rescue mission.” Okiyi said one person was confirmed dead while search continued, adding that anyone found culpable in the incident would be prosecuted.
