The Nigeria Police Force has commenced investigations into a viral video showing a man wearing what appears to be a Nigeria Police “uniform” smoking shisha. On its official Twitter handle @PoliceNG on Sunday, the Police said the investigation will amongst other things seek to forensically establish authenticity of the video, the true identity of the man in the uniform – whether he is in fact a policeman, an impostor or an actor in a movie scene. “However, while not being prejudicial to the ongoing investigations, it is necessary to state that the character exhibited by the man in the uniform is not a true reflection of who we are as a regimented law enforcement agency – our trainings, discipline, norms and tradition. “Meanwhile, members of the public with useful information that can assist police investigations are enjoined to provide same via the following; pressforabuja@police.gov.ng, or DM on our social media platforms,” the tweet reads.
