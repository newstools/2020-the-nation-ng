The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) would not relax its onslaught against bandits until criminals stopped killing innocent civilians, Chief of Air Staff (CAS) Air Marshal Sadeeq Abubakar, has vowed. Air Marshal Abubakar spoke in Katsina State on Thursday during an on-the-spot assessment of “Operation Wutan Daji Two“, a subsidiary of “Operation Hadarin Daji.” The operation was recently launched to restore sanity in the Northwest. He explained that “Operation Wutan Daji Two” has a mandate to identify bandits’ locations in the forests with a view to flushing them out. Asked how long the operation would last, the CAS said: “We don’t know, we will make sure until we catch the bandits in their nets. The fighting is not going to end until we make sure that no civilian is killed and we clear the bandits in the forests.” He expressed satisfaction with the operation by the Air officers and men and urged them to work in synergy with other security agencies against banditry, kidnapping, cattle rustling and criminal acts. The CAS said that he got the briefs from the officers in charge of the ongoing operation who pointed out the areas of changes and needs.
