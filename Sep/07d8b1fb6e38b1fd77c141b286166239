Nigeria international Victor Osimhen had an assist to show for his impressive display, but was yellow-carded in the closing minutes, as Genoa suffered a 6-0 obliteration against Napoli on Sunday evening. Getting his first start in a competitive game for the Blues since his record move from Lille, Osimhen caused the visitors a lot of problems as they were blown apart inside Stadio San Paolo. The game’s first chance fell before the Nigeria international, but he fired his effort over the crossbar from inside the box after latching onto a short pass from Hirving Lozano.  The 21-year-old fed Piotr Zielinski with an accurate pass in the first minute of the second half to give Gennaro Gattuso’s team a 2-0 lead. Lozano’s brilliant shot in the 10th minute had given Napoli the lead.  Mertens made it three for the hosts after 57 minutes before Lozano completed his brace eight minutes later. Eljif Elmas slotted home the fifth goal of the evening before Matteo Politano completed the damage 18 minutes from full-time.
