The Presidential Task Force (PTF) on Thursday revealed that most COVID-19 fatalities are as a result of reporting late for treatment, especially when such conditions have worsened. It added that although there are no shortages in bed spaces in states across the country, efforts must be intensified with regards to sample collection, surveillance and treatment. Minister of Health Dr. Osagie Ehanire stated these known in Abuja during the briefing of the PTF on COVID-19. He said: “As of this morning, the Federal Ministry of Health has recorded 56,604 covid-19 positive cases out of a total of 482,321 samples tested, giving a positivity rate of 11.7 per cent.  47,872 persons have been treated and discharged, but we have sadly lost 1,091 persons to the disease. “Our objective is still to lower the case fatality rate to less than one per cent, but an additional challenge we have observed is that most fatalities are among those reporting late for treatment, when their clinical condition has worsened. “The delay in deciding whether or when to go for treatment is what we must fight. I, therefore, renew my plea to all those who test positive, are 60 years or older and have underlying health conditions, to report immediately to a treatment facility.” He also use the opportunity to renew his call to members of Joint Health Sector Union (JOHESU) “to put the plight, safety and wellbeing of their patients into consideration, and to call off the ongoing strike, while differences are being addressed by negotiation”.
