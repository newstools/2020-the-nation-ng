Ozo has won an Innoson IVM Caris car worth N4.5 million after emerging tops in the Innoson motors challenge. The two-time Head of House won the vehicle after emerging the last man standing in the challenge. The challenge, which had other Housemates keenly contesting to win the car, saw Ozo, Neo, and Dorathy as the last three standing. Neo gave Ozo a run for his money in the challenge that eventually had him bowing out of the challenge for not being able to memorise the digits previewed in the lounge’s TV. The winner of the BBNaija Season 5 tagged Lockdown will win an Innoson G80 (Innoson G Wagon) valued at N27,825,000, a cash prize of N30 million, and other valuable prizes valued at N28 million. Other Housemates that have won challenges include TrikyTee and Ozo for the Pepsi challenge, Nengi, Laycon, and Dorathy. The Innoson IVM Caris has an engine capacity of 2.0L and one of the company’s forays into future car designs. With captivating sleeker design, the car remains many of the housemates’ dreams.
