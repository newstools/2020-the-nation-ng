 FORMER Nigerian international Akin Akinsehinde and self-styled Nigerian football ambassador Friday Kujah have frowned at the choices of coaches recently appointed into the national teams. The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) last week listed Ladan Bosso as U-20 Boys’ Head Coach with Christopher Danjuma retaining the U20 Girls’ job and Fatai Amoo for the Golden Eaglets among several other appointees. But Akinsehinde  who star for Nigeria in the 1990s, said some of the appointments beggar belief, adding the NFF should have considered  the likes of Finidi George, Peter Ijeh and host of  other emerging young coaches for the jobs. “I don’t think we can ever get it right again, and it is not a curse,” began Akinsehinde, the former Zamalek striker.“ I think something is wrong somewhere if Finidi George can be begging for the national team job. “Finidi who played with great clubs  in Europe and with the Super Eagles  was not considered and we  had  some that never made any mark even  in the local league being considered; It’s too bad.” Speaking in the same vein, Kujah said: What are the criteria they used in appointing those coaches? “We know  Oladunni Oyekale, an ex-international, who have seen it all in terms of football, Fatai Amoo too; Ladan Bosso too has done much in football but we are talking about people  with new ideas. “Football changes every day and people with fresh knowledge of the game should have been appointed and I am talking about Finidi George, Peter Ijeh and others.”
