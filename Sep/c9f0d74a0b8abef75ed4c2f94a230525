Nigeria’s private sector think tank, Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG) last week criticised CBN’s foreign exchange management, decrying what it described as lack of clarity in the apex bank’s approach. “The group expresses serious concerns about how the CBN has carried on the business of foreign exchange transactions, loan disbursements (intervention funds) and price fixings without appropriate policy clarity. This can be subject to abuses, manipulations and significant market disruptions, reflective of a policy akin to crony capitalism. We therefore respectfully request the appropriate authorities to properly review this policy to restore credibility into our financial sector,” NESG stated.
