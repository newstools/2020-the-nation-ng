 SOKOTO State Governor Aminu Tambuwal has said the credibility or otherwise of the coming governorship elections in Edo and Ondo states will define President Muhammadu Buhari’s electoral legacy. He spoke against the backdrop of the visa ban imposed by the United States of America on some Nigerian politicians for their alleged roles in the violence that characterised the November 16, 2019 governorship elections in Kogi and Bayelsa states. In a statement yesterday, the governor stressed the need to strengthen the nation’s electoral process, to restore the hope and aspirations of Nigerians in democracy. Tambuwal, who wrote in commemoration of the International Day of Democracy, marked globally every September 15, said: “Indeed the coming governorship elections in Edo and Ondo states are a test case of our preparedness for a rule-based and consent-enabled governance. “In 2007, the United Nations General Assembly resolved to observe  September 15 of every year as the International Day of Democracy, with the purpose of promoting and upholding the principles of democracy and invited member-states and organisations to commemorate the day in an appropriate manner that contributes to raising public awareness. “The preamble of the resolution affirms that while democracies share common features, there is no single model of democracy and that democracy does not belong to any country or region…democracy is a universal value based on the freely-expressed will of people to determine their own political, economic, social and cultural systems, and their full participation in all aspects of life.”
