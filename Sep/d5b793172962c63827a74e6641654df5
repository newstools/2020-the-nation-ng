Katagum said in keeping to its promise to support businesses overcome challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the government is set to commence implementation of two MSMEs’ initiatives, namely, the MSME Survival Fund and the Payroll Support schemes, as the first to be rolled out with N60 billion and then, the Guaranteed Off-take Scheme, N15billion. Katagum noted that both schemes are at the core of the N2.3 trillion stimulus package also known as the NESP being implemented by the Buhari Administration to help cushion the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to boost the economy by saving jobs and creating new job opportunities. Statistics released by SMEDAN and the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) stated that over 95 percent of the 41 million MSMEs in Nigeria are micro businesses. Consequently, the nation cannot afford to neglect this huge segment of our economic landscape which contributes a very high percentage to employment and the GDP.
