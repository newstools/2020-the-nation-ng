 You may have heard that former Secretary to the Ondo State Government (SSG), Ifedayo Abegunde, who quit his position and joined Governor Rotimi Akeredolu’s political opponents ahead of the October gubernatorial poll, has made a u-turn. What you may not know is how the political allies made peace. It was learnt that following his emergence as APC candidate, Akeredolu was determined to go to the election with the party’s full complement. Sources described the truce as a product of his sportsmanship and uncommon courage by the former SSG. This was about the time rumours became rife that the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its candidate Eyitayo Jegede were courting Abegunde who, incidentally, used to be a chieftain of the party before the 2012 election. Not ready to take chances, Akeredolu approached prominent APC elders to reconcile him with his former SSG. The elders brokered peace between the two men after a series of peace meetings where they bared their minds before agreeing to work together again. “The last of the meetings was held at Government House in Akure last Sunday,” a source claimed.
