Bayelsa State government has entered into a partnership with the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) to boost maritime trade and stem the cycle of criminalities in and around the state. The Governor, Senator Douye Diri, who spoke in Lagos on Monday, said he was at NIMASA to facilitate the  cordial relationship between the agency and the state, and protect maritime environment to create employment and boost revenue. Bemoaning the high rate of kidnapping, piracy and other maritime  crimes in the state, the governor sought the support of the agency’s Director-General (DG), Dr Bashir Jamoh, in ensuring security for maritime operations in the state and region. To this end, the governor sought increased presence of the agency in the state and urged the DG to open an office in the state capital, Yenagoa, to curtail maritime criminalities and protect maritime assets of the state. The governor said local government headquarters and local government areas in the state are accessible by water. “And until this moment, there are three local government areas that you can only access through water. You cannot access them by land. Therefore, I believe that this agency and Bayelsa State are twins. We are brother and sister and that is why we need to join hands together to strengthen the maritime domain of this country. We need you and we also believe that you need Bayelsa State,” the governor said.
