  Chieftains of Ohanaeze Ndigbo have been warned against threatening other zones in their quest for a president of Igbo extraction. A lawyer, Prince Uche Okeke spoke on Tuesday at Nkpor in Idemili North Local Government of Anambra State. He was reacting to secession threats by certain chieftains of Ohanaeze and other stakeholders. Okeke said Ndigbo should employ dialogue, stressing that threats of secession was capable of scuttling the Igbo project. He said: “As much as I strongly advocate for a president of Igbo extraction in 2023, threats that Ndigbo will break away if not elected president, already coming from notable Igbo stakeholders, could boomerang and endanger the agenda. “Ohanaeze chieftains or anybody who made secession statements should employ dialogue to make other zones and political parties adopt an Igbo person as a presidential candidate.” The lawyer listed the merits of zoning as cost reduction, opportunity to harness human resources from different zones, and promotion of development at different parts of the country. “Zoning may not be written in the constitution, but there is what is called convention – when something is practised over the years, it could be accepted as a law. “Going by all comers, some sections of the society will be at a disadvantage. Zoning makes development go round. Every zone has enough human resources that can handle the affairs of the various states,” he added.
