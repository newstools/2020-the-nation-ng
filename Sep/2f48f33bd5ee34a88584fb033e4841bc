As Nigeria commemorates its 60th Independence Anniversary, E-Hailing App Company – MyKab has commenced operations in Nigeria. MyKab, a home-grown application has been put in place to meet the needs of all stakeholders. According to ‘Wagbemiga Mary-Peter Onifade, E-hailing freelancer, he said, “MyKab is an indigenous company, it is the answer to the agitations and groins of the operators of the e-hailing industry. “MyKab is the solution to the myriads of problems facing the drivers who are the major stakeholders in the industry.” “As a Nigerian company, the Management of MyKab understands the yearnings and aspirations of Nigerians in the e-hailing sector of the Nigerian economy. Because they have been here and saw the problems first-hand, they were able to build an indigenous app that meets the yearnings and aspirations of Nigerians”, he further said. While x-raying Nigeria’s transportation system which went through different stages of development, he said, “the different memories of the different stages of transformation in the transport sector tells the story of resilience and tenacity; values which stands out Nigerians wherever they find themselves.” “With these transformational developments came the problems of the e-hailing sector. E-Hailing or Ride-Hailing was alien to the transport system in Nigeria prior to its advent in 2013. Ever since, transportation has taking a new shape in Nigeria”, he added. The E-Hailing app company will provide support to Nigerian drivers who at some point were at the mercy of the different foreign App Companies who birthed the sector.
