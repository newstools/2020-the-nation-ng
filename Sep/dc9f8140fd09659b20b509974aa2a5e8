 Badman Chorus has spoken on his recently released Extended Play, ‘Believe.’ The eight-track album features one of Nigeria’s finest artiste, Ycee. Speaking on what inspired the EP, Badman Chorus said it revolves around his journey through music. “The EP was inspired by my journey through music, the whole process of it. I have been through the works, the ups and downs, the falls, and the growth. All that energy is what I channeled into the Ep”, he said. Speaking further, he said the new EP isn’t a full expression of his art but the beginning of what he is bringing to the industry.  “I won’t say it’s the full expression of my art. I will say it’s just the beginning of my art to the world. There are more expressions to come, both the ones I know already and the ones that are yet to come. The vibe is Complex but it’s worth it”. Badman Chorus also said working with Ycee on the EP came easy as they both connected fast. “Ycee is one of the artistes in Nigeria whom I feel his music and connect with his story so our vibe just connected when we met, then he blessed me with his vibe and that was it. “It’s worth the listen. People should listen to my EP because of the content it carries.”
