A former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Chief John Odigie-Oyegun has explained why he didn’t campaign for the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its Edo governorship candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu in the just-concluded contest. Ize-Iyamu lost to Governor Godwin Obaseki of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) with many APC chieftains, including Odigie-Iyamu, believed to have worked against him. He said he stayed away despite being a member of the National Campaign Council because he never wanted to be part of ‘illegality’. He spoke with reporters at his Benin residence. The ex-Edo Governor said: “I am a man of conscience. I am a strong believer in justice and fair play. “I am a strong believer that, when the rules of an association you belong have been so flagrantly disregarded, put aside and not complied with, then you have to go back to your conscience to say, can I support what has happened? Can I not support what has happened? I cannot support injustice. “Your loyalty in life should be what is right, that is principle. Every human being must live for something. If you are ready to kill a man you know did not commit a crime, then something is wrong with you. “Even in the family, if a family member commits a crime, he has to agree that he has committed the crime. When you start shouting no, he has done nothing wrong, then something is wrong with you. So, it was a basic issue of principle, it is a basic issue of conscience.”
