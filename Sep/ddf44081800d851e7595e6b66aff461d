Benue State Governor; Samuel Ortom has expressed shock over the interception of a government convoy, arrest and killing of Terwase Akwaza, aka Gana by military authorities. Governor Ortom made his feelings known on Wednesday at the Government House Makurdi while briefing Journalists on the state of the second amnesty programme of his administration which covers Sankera geopolitical zone. He however noted that he was still awaiting briefing from the Commander Operation Ayem A Kpatuma from Doma in Nasarawa State, Major General Moundhey Gadzama Ali who promised he was coming to brief him on their operation. The Governor stated that five repentant youths from Ukum Local Government Area who were among those arrested by the Nigerian Army were released and were conveyed to the Benue Peoples House Makurdi by the Council Chairman of Ukum, Hon. Stephen Ayua to be part of the amnesty offer. The Governor explained that the amnesty programme was not truncated as those who could not make it to Makurdi due to the confusion created by the military operation would be given another chance. He urged the people of Sankera to remain calm as he was still investigating circumstances surrounding the arrest and killing of Gana before taking action on the matter, stressing that he owes Benue people the duty to protect lives and property. Governor Ortom had earlier addressed the 42 repentant youths and commended them for choosing to abandon their negative ways to open a new chapter of their lives.
