Enugu State Police Commissioner Ahmad Abdurrahman has said the detained member of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) is being treated to be fit for trial. Abdurrahman, in a statement on Thursday by the spokesman, Daniel Ndukwe, said allegations the suspect was chained and left to bleed to death was misleading. He said four others had been charged to court and remanded in prison for conspiracy, treasonable felony and murder. Abdurrahman debunked allegations the police took money for the suspectâ€™s bail, saying neither his grandfather nor his relatives were detained and freed after paying N55,000. He enjoined the people to remain law-abiding and guard against falsehood and baseless allegations.
