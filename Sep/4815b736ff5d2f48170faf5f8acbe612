The NSCDC State Commandant, David Bille made the appeal on Tuesday while hosting the newly appointed Commanding Officer Naval Outpost Onitsha (NOPO), Captain Innocent Pius Udoudoh.

He applauded the Commanding Officer for the visit, assuring him of support and a cordial working relationship throughout his stay in the state. Earlier, Capt. Udoudoh underscored the place of stronger synergy among security agencies in the state. He said there was a need for both bodies to co-operate in the state to further strengthen the already existing working relationship with other security agencies for effective results.
