 The African Democratic Congress (ADC) has explained why it will not engage in much outdoor rallies to sell its candidate, Prince Dapo Adelegan. It said it would rather engage in door-to- door campaigns, use radio, social media and outdoor advertisement to reach out to the people and make them understand their campaign messages. The ADC noted that political rallies would not be the best avenue to articulate its manifesto. Adelegan said in an interview that the people needed to understand that there was a new narrative, a new voice and a vision for the state.  He said some parties used rallies to create the impression that the people supported them. Adelegan said: “We have declared that we are going to run a violence-free campaign. We are going to decrease a number of our public outings because it is at public rallies that rival groups begin to emerge. We have encouraged our people to embark on door-to-door canvassing, online canvassing and through radio. “We believe that rallies are not the best place to articulate our vision. Our people appreciate the fact that we are coming to talk to them about what matters to them- education of their children, health service, water transportation, industrialisation and economy that will give sustenance and jobs to their children. We are talking and they are listening. “
