The Delta State Police Command says 11 suspected kidnappers have been arrested by its men. A firearm, ammunition, and 11 mobile phones were also recovered from the suspects who were arrested at different locations in the state. According to the Commissioner of Police, Mr. Hafiz Inuwa, the suspects were arrested separately by policemen on routine “stop and search duties”. Inuwa said, “We have arrested 11 kidnappers. They kidnapped somebody and dispossessed him of his SUV. They were intercepted by our men and two were arrested. “The two led to the arrests of nine others in Oghara, Mosogar, Jesse and Sapele communities in Ethiope-West and Sapele Local Government Areas of the state.” He noted that the suspected kidnappers have been troubling and disturbing the police in the areas mentioned above. Commending his men for the good works, the Police boss urged them to intensify efforts in ensuring that the areas are crime-free.
