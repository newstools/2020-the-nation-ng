Lagos State Government is committed to the deployment of technology to manage traffic congestion, Commissioner for Information and Strategy Mr. Gbenga Omotoso has said. He spoke on Thursday at the Lagos Traffic Radio during the inauguration of the pilot scheme of the Lagos Traffic Radio motorcycles meant to boost live coverage of gridlock and other incidents obstructing traffic. He said although the initiative was commendable, as it represented the station’s humble effort to boost traffic and travel advisory responsibilities to the motoring public, the government would continue to pursue the deployment of technology to help ease traffic control and enhance its enforcement capabilities. Omotoso said: “The government has mounted close circuit cameras at the Allen Avenue roundabout and other areas where it recently completed junction improvement works.  When these cameras are all over Lagos, it will be needless for LASTMA officials to embark on physical arrest of offending vehicles, as any motorist who offends traffic regulations will be ticketed and such fines taken to their homes.” Lagos Traffic Radio’s General Manager Mr. Tayo Akanle said the acquisition of the motorcycles is the station’s contribution to the actualisation of the Traffic Management and Transportation component of the THEMES agenda of the state government.
