Some members of All Progressives Congress (APC) in Bayelsa West have defected to Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to protest alleged violation of zoning arrangement. Led by former Chairman of Ogobiri Youth Association, Ekadi Desire, the defectors were received by PDP Chairman in Sagbama Local Government, Ofoni Oyafikunmo; Vice Chairman Michael Magbisa and Council Chairman Embeleakpo Alade. Desire said they left APC because of violation of the existing zoning of political offices between Sagbama and Ekeremor. The youth leader said the two National Assembly positions were shared between Ekeremor and Sagbama. He said it was provocative for APC to field Peremobowei Ebebi, from Ekeremor, for the senatorial election, when an Ekeremor son, Fred Agbedi, is in the House of Representatives. The defector described Ebebi’s emergence as a deliberate and unacceptable oppression of APC members in Sagbama, saying they believed in Dickson’s ability to defend Ijaw interest. Dickson said the APC leadership was executing a plan to cause needless division and tension in the senatorial district. He thanked the people for their support, and promised that the defectors would be given equal rights as others.
