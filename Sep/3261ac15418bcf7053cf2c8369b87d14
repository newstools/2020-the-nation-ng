Nengi has asked Ozo to focus on his main objective of coming to the Bshow. She said this after Ozo got a second strike on Friday for writing her a love letter, which is against the House rules. The ex-beauty queen told Ozo to cut her off if she’s becoming a distraction for him. Nengi has always maintained that they can only be friends. She restated this to Ozo they should leave the whole love issue till after the House and focus on the N85million price. “If I am a distraction please cut me off because I feel like I am a distraction to you. “Let’s leave all this whole love thing and focus on why we are here because this is a once- in- a lifetime opportunity. “We can’t come here and misuse the opportunity we have here and I have told you we have to start mingling with other Housemates. “I am feeling guilty about all of this because I feel like I am the one making you do these stuff. “Don’t let anything or anyone make you forget why you are here,” she advised.
