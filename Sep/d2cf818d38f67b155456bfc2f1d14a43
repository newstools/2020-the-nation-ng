Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) President Amaju Pinnick through his foundation has taken up the educational needs of the two older children of the late NFF Head of ICT, Tolulope Abe. Pinnick added that similar arrangements would also be made for the other three children once they gain admission into higher institutions by Brownhill Foundation. First Vice President of the NFF, Barrister Seyi Akinwunmi said he was devastated by news of Tolulope’s passing and would only be ready and willing to assist the family in whichever way he could going forward. The remains of Tolulope Abe, who died on Saturday, 29th  August 2020, was committed to mother earth in Abuja last Saturday. “Brownhill Foundation will start with the two children who are in the university already, and subsequently the Foundation will be ready to extend these to the other children once they enter higher institutions of learning,” Pinnick said on a visit to the late Abe’s residence in Kubwa, Abuja yesterday. “We are all very much pained by Tolulope Abe’s death. He was a very dedicated and loyal staff and will be very difficult to replace. “This family will never be abandoned. Whatever we can do for the other children before they get to higher institutions of learning, we will. That is the least we can do for a wonderful individual and member of staff like Tolulope Abe,” added Pinnick.
