 Nigeria’s undisputed champion in the men’s class four of para table tennis Isau Ogunkunle is hopeful of  winning a medal at his debut at the Tokyo 2021 Paralympic Games in Japan. The  Oyo State-born star  who has been tipped  by five-time African Egypt’s Mohamed Sameh Eid Saleh as the next big thing for Africa at the Paralympic Games, said he cannot wait to show his talent to the world. “It just like I am ready to represent Nigeria at the games and I must return with a medal. I may not be able to ascertain the colour of the medal but I am sure I will be at the podium in Japan,” he said. Ogunkunle dream of competing at the games became a reality through his ranking as the 12th rated player in class four worldwide -after losing the sole continental slot to Eid Saleh at the African qualifiers in Alexandria, Egypt in July 2019.  “In 2011 when I first played against Mohamed Sameh Eid, he defeated me 3-0 but after the match he came to me to comfort and encouraged me not to give up. Since then we have been friends and we communicate with each other regularly. He became my idol in the game.” Ogunkunle said. “I have been dreaming of competing at the Paralympic Games for a very long time because I know if I am given the chance I will do well for Nigeria.”
