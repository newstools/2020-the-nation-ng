The police in Lagos State have described a video trending online, accusing police of brutality while effecting an arrest, as an attempt to give the Nigeria Police Force a bad image. The Public Relations Officer in the command, SP Olumuyiwa Adejobi, in a statement on Tuesday said that the video was a calculated attempt to malign the efforts of the police in maintaining law and order. Adejobi said that Insp. Stephen Inumanu, attached to Igando Police Station was the officer shown in the viral video apprehending the suspected hoodlum who resisted arrest. “Inumanu with two other team members were deployed on a routine Stop and Search duty on Sept. 18 at Isuti Road in Egan area, Lagos State. “The team sighted two nervous young men who took to their heels. They were chased and one Stephen Ade, 28, was arrested while his partner escaped with a micro wallet. “Ade, practically refused arrest as captured in the video but was subdued with the aid of members of the public using minimal force, without assault from the arm bearing Inspector,” he said. Adejobi said that the trending video had been carefully edited by the sender to remove a barrage of insults the suspect hauled on the police officer in the presence of civilians. He reiterated the command’s commitment to discharging its duties with diligence, human feelings, and respect for the rule of law and human rights.  (NAN)
