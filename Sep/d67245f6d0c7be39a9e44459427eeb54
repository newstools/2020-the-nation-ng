 Wife of the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate in Edo State Prof. Idia Ize-Iyamu said yesterday that Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu would fight the infrastructure battle, if elected. She said dilapidated structures dotting public institutions across the state, especially in the health and education sectors, and poor implementation of women empowerment programmes, investment in agriculture and functional security architecture, would be a thing of the past. Prof. Ize-Iyamu was addressing APC supporters at Ward 12, Oredo Local Government, who warmly received her. She said functional and affordable infrastructures, which are the highlights of her husband’s manifesto, titled ‘Simple Agenda,’ will guarantee development and the general well-being of the populace.  Prof. Ize-Iyamu took the constituents through the rudiments of proper voting process to ensure they vote for the right candidate. She appealed to them to vote for her husband to sweep out the bad government. The Chairman of APC Oredo Ward 12, Mr. Ernest Edebiri, welcoming the campaign team, assured them that they were set to vote out the bad government of Godwin Obaseki on September 19. The Director General of APC Women Campaign Council, Elizabeth Ativie, on behalf of the party, received hundreds of members of PDP and other parties, who defected to the APC at the campaign ground.
