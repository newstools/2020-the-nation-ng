 PASTOR Osagie Ize-Iyamu, the standard bearer of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the Edo State governorship election, has promised to reopen the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Benin depot for economic activities if elected. He spoke yesterday in Benin when he met the Concerned Workers of the Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG), Warri Zone, in Benin. Ize-Iyamu said closure of the depot had deprived the state of huge economic resources as well as posed a challenge to marketers in sourcing petroleum products outside the state. “The government should have taken it up when petroleum products were no longer supplied to the depot. “Let me assure you that reopening of the depot will be one of my priorities. “We will do it to keep our state economically vibrant and ensure that petroleum products are supplied in the state,” he said.
