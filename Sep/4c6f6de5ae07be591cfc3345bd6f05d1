Neo has said he is not certain if his relationship with Vee would work outside the Big Brother Naija House. Neo said he wasted time in expressing his feelings to Vee. He said this during a discussion with Dorathy. Neo added that he took so much time figuring out his feelings for Vee which has made her have a rethink about them. “I made a mistake with Vee and it’s hurting me,” he began. “I should have asked her to be my girlfriend earlier. “My uncertainty has made her have a rethink about us and I think I’ve lost my chances of being in a relationship with her outside the House.”
