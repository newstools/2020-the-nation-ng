Chieftains of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Edo State have called on eligible voters to come out en masse without fear of intimidation and harassment to vote for the candidate of the party, Governor Godwin Obaseki. The chieftains who spoke during a road show organised by leaders of Oredo Ward 2 to educate the people against election apathy, urged the electorate to come out and exercise their franchise for the candidate of their choice. The Vice Chairman of Oredo Local Government, Mrs. Belinda Ogiefa, said: “Come out and vote; don’t be afraid of any form of violence. This road show is meant to educate the masses that Governor Godwin Obaseki is no longer in All Progressives Congress (APC). You should not be deceived. “We are pleading with you to come out and vote; there will not be any violence as the security agencies are going to ensure the protection of lives and property.  “Security personnel will be fully on ground to deal with anyone trying to cause mayhem on that day. The PDP is fully ready and on ground.” Also, Mrs. Eki Osakue said: “Those threatening to fight on election day are just propagandists. They are only trying to scare people, but we are not scared. We just want to let them know that we are ready for the election.” PDP Zonal Secretary in Unit 8 and 9, Mr. Lucky Edomen, promised to mobilise more voters to ensure the governor’s victory. He hailed  Obaseki’s performance across all sectors of the state. “His developmental strides and projects are there for everyone to see. The opposition has nothing to show; they have no record. “Obaseki is very popular and will be re-elected  because of his performance. We want to let the people know that the governor is no longer in APC but PDP; they must not get it wrong on election day,” Edomen said.
