Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Edo State on Monday urged opposition parties to stop contriving violence ahead of the September 19 governorship election. Publicity Secretary Mr. Chris Nehikhare, speaking in Benin at a news conference, alleged that the opposition parties were contriving violence to make room for the postponement of the election. He said the PDP as a major player wants the poll, which is just 12 days away, to hold. Nehikhare, however, said the PDP was happy that there had been no new attack on its members since the Oba of Benin, Oba Ewuare II, held a peace meeting with the two major actors in the election. He condemned the antics of the opposition, adding that no PDP member would want the election postponed or a state of emergency declared in Edo. Nehikhare said the party would not derail the process or deviate from its commitment to free, transparent and credible election. He enjoined the opposition to carry on with their campaigns by telling Edo people what they could do, rather than plotting for a postponement of the election.
