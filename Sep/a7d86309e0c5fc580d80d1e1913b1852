Ondo State Governor and candidate of the All Progressives Congress Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has told residents of Akoko in Ondo North that water will flow from the Awara dam within the first 100 days after his re-election. He said consultants and engineers have been engaged and are working on rehabilitation and articulation of the dam. The Awara dam was built to supply 6.7 million litres of water to residents in Ikare, Akunha, Arigidi and other parts of Akoko land. Akeredolu said there was need for the people to vote for continuity of the APC- led administration, for them to enjoy good governance. He spoke when he was commissioned into the Order of the Crownhood of St. Paul by the Diocese of Akokoland, Church of Nigeria, Anglican Communion. Monarchs in the four local government areas in Akokoland have endorsed Akeredolu for a second term. They endorsed Akeredolu at the palace of Olubaka of Oka, Oba Yusuf Asebori Adeleye. The traditional ruler vowed to work for the re-election of Akeredolu.
