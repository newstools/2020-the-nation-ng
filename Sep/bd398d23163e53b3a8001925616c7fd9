Nigeria-born Dan Azeez retained his British light-heavyweight title with a crushing ninth round knock-out win over Andre Sterling at Production Parks Studios on Wednesday night. Azeez’s clinical display led to Sterling’s corner throwing in the towel during round nine, seeing Azeez extend his unbeaten record and keep hold of his belt in the process. Azeez said: “I’ve known Andre for years, but the build-up meant that I wanted to punish him and then get him out of there. I knew I could get him out of there and it wasn’t a surprise to me. “He got me with a good shot in round five, but unfortunately for him it pushed me on even more. One of my drives was my mum, she was suffering from COVID and was on her deathbed, but thanks to the NHS she made a full recovery.”
