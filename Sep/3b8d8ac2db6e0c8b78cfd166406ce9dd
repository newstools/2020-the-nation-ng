 Nigeria international full-back, Ola Aina, has reached an agreement to join Fulham on a season-long loan with an option to buy from Torino. The 23-year-old spent the last two seasons with the Serie A giants, leaving Chelsea permanently last summer after a season-long loan in Italy. Fulham are landing a quality defender that brings experience to the table, and it will be interesting to see how he fares at Craven Cottage. Aina played six games for the Blues before joining Hull City on loan for 2017-18, and he has grown in leaps and bounds since. While the Nigerian is primarily a full-back, he is also comfortable as a wing-back and can play on both the left and right side of the pitch. The soon-to-be Fulham defender has eight assists and a goal over the last three seasons and manager Scott Parker will hope his defensive and attacking abilities come handy as his side looks to hold on to their top-flight status at the end of 2020-21.
