 Three children aged between five and six  escaped death in Akwa Ibom on Sunday when a landslide swept off their kitchen minutes after preparing their dinner. The incident also cut off a street in Uyo, the state capital. The street and others in the area have been badly affected by erosion for over 30 years. “It was a devastating experience. Three children were preparing their meals in the kitchen. After they left the kitchen, it was not even up to five minutes, when the kitchen collapsed. ‘’The children were eating when suddenly there was a bang and the kitchen and everything inside it were buried. They would have been trapped; it was a miracle,” said Mr Francis Ikpe, landlord of the affected house. He said the problem become serious when the state government embarked on street repairs and construction of drainages, saying water from six adjoining streets had been channeled to the place without a chamber constructed to receive the volume of water “We have lived with the erosion for more than 30 years, but when the state government started massive street repairs, water from the six adjoining streets has been diverted to the place and no chamber was done to receive the water. “A lot of damage has been caused to that place. Whenever it rains the volume of water increases and this has been posing a threat to life and property,” he said. He called on the state government to intervene before the house is completely buried by the landslide.
