 CANDIDATE of All Progressives Congress (APC) for Bayelsa West Senatorial by-election Peremabowei Ebebi has asked the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) to forget zoning. Ebebi, who hails from Ekeremor Local Government, argued that former Governor Seriake Dickson, of PDP, destroyed the zoning arrangement through choices he made before leaving office as governor. He said arguments by some PDP members that it was the turn of Sagbama, Dickson’s council, to produce the next senator, amounted to playing on the zone’s intelligence. Ebebi noted that those promoting such arguments were encouraging political greed and trying to make Sagbama superior to the principles of justice, equity and good conscience. A former deputy governor, he said Sagbama, through Dickson, occupied the governorship for eight years with his kinsman, Lawrence Ehwrudjakpo as commissioner for Works and Infrastructure. He said during 2019 election, Dickson brought Ehwrudjakpo to contest and win Sagbama West senatorial election, and still made Ehwrudjakpo deputy governor. The aspirant said if Dickson valued zoning, he would have supported someone from Ekeremor to be deputy governor, to give Sagbama moral rectitude to lay claim to the Senate. Ebebi insisted it would be unjustifiable and unfair for Sagbama, having occupied the governorship for eight years, to retain the positions of deputy governor and a senator, and make Ekeremor a political orphan. He said: “Zoning has been destroyed by Dickson. Dickson was governor for eight years and he should have considered Ekeremor, being brother to Sagbama, for deputy governor. But he gave it to the commissioner for Works, who was already a senator. He abandoned that senatorial seat to become a deputy governor.” Ebebi promised to pursue legislation to address underdevelopment and ecological problems in the zone, if elected as senator. He promised to focus on youth and student empowerment through scholarships and human capital development.
