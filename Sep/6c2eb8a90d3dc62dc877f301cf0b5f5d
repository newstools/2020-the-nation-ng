BAYERN Munich have reignited their interest in signing Callum Hudson-Odoi from Chelsea, according to reports in Germany. In January 2019, the Champions League holders submitted multiple offers to Chelsea for the 19-year-old, including an bid of £35 million. But Chelsea turned down Bayern’s advances and instead Hudson-Odoi signed a new five-year contract in September. Bayern are keen to bolster their attacking options following Ivan Perisic’s departure this summer. BARCELONA have agreed a deal in principle to sign Lyon captain and former Manchester United captain Memphis Depay, claims De Telegraaf. Memphis, who was Netherlands captain under Koeman, has agreed a four-year deal running until the summer of 2024.The 26-year-old has entered the final 12 months of his current Lyon contract and Barcelona have agreed a cut-price 30m Euros (£27.6m) fee with the Ligue 1 outfit. ASTON Villa are planning to build a “top team” around England international Jack Grealish after he signed a new five-year contract. The 25-year-old playmaker and club captain had been linked with a move away from the Premier League side during the transfer window. However, Grealish laid those fears to rest by announcing the new contract with the club he has been with since he was eight years old.
