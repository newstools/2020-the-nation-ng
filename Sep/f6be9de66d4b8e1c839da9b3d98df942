Imo FA chairman Amanze Uchegbulam and former Enyimba coach Alphonsus Dike have both hailed the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF)  over its choice of  next month’s friendly games for the Super Eagles. The NFF boss Amaju Pinnick revealed  Wednesday that the Eagles will face Cote ‘d’Ivoire on October 9 and also trade tackles with Tunisia four days later in  Austria as preparatory  for the 2021 AFCON double-header against the Leone Stars of Sierra Leone in November. “It is just normal that the Eagles are kept busy ahead of the AFCON qualifiers and the World Cup Qualifying matches too that will kick off from November this year,” Uchegbulam told NationSport.”They have done the right thing to put the games in Austria because of the financial implications and also the proximity of the players to Austria. “The choice of Cote ‘d’Ivoire and Tunisia is also very good. Both teams will give the Eagles tough time and they will bring out the best in our team.” Dike was also full of praises of  the NFF even as he challenged  the technical crew raise a formidable team against Cote ‘d’Ivoire  and Tunisia. “What else can I say? NFF did a good job getting both teams to face the Eagles. It is just normal for us to get our best legs for the game,” Dike admonished. “The technical crew must strive to prosecute the games with most of the players they are hoping to use for the November AFCON qualifiers with Sierra Leone.”
