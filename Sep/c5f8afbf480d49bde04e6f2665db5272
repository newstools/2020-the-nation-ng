Serena Williams has yet to make a concrete decision on competing at this year’s French Open, which begins later in September. World No 1 Ashleigh Barty will not defend her title in Paris after deciding against travelling to Europe. The 24-year-old, who claimed a maiden Grand Slam crown at Roland Garros in 2019, is still concerned about the health risks due to the coronavirus pandemic. Williams, speaking after reaching the US Open quarter-finals for the 16th time, could be one of those who does follow Barty in withdrawing as she would prefer to stay in private accommodation due to her health issues. She said: “If there are fans, then we should be able to stay elsewhere. “It’s just, for me, I’m super conservative because I do have some serious health issues, so I try to stay away from public places, because I have been in a really bad position in the hospital a few times. So I don’t want to end up in that position again. “I’m going to have to make the best decision for my health. Maybe it will be good for me to talk to the organisers  just to see how that works with the crowd and how we will be protected.”
