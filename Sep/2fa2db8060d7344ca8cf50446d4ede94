At least five people have lost their lives in the last three weeks in Bauchi state following a flood caused by a heavy downpour which has continued to wreak havoc in vulnerable communities. The recent incident which occurred on Monday night claimed the life of a 15-year old boy and a 60-year-old woman in the Adamami village in Shira Local Government Area while one person was said to have been critically injured. This is just as 200 houses were pulled down as well as 3000 hectares of farmlands were washed away during the heavy downpour. Our Correspondent gathered that men of the Adamami village spent sleepless nights trying to rescue their wives and children who were trapped in the debris of some of the collapsed houses. Residents said the heavy downpour which led to the collapse of most of the mud houses in the village, also affected their means of livelihood as farmlands measuring more than 3000 hectares were destroyed. Confirming the incident to our correspondent on phone, the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) Perm Secretary, Shehu Habu said ”according to the report we received from our assessment team and the Local Government assessment team, two people lost their lives yesterday in the devastating flood, a 15-year old boy and a 60-year-old woman while the third person was injured. ”A lot of houses, farmlands were also destroyed.
