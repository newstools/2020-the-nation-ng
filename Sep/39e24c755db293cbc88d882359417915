 Laycon, Dorathy, Ozo and TrikyTee have been nominated for possible eviction. The four were put up for possible eviction after six of the remaining seven Housemates nominated two members after they were grouped into two teams by Biggie through a blind process after the ninth Head of House game. Nengi had scaled through the nomination process after emerging the Head of House for the second time. Dorathy, Neo, and Ozo fell into the black group while Vee, Laycon, and TrikyTee fell into the white team. Biggie tasked the groups to have conversations for 30 minutes on the choice of two Housemates from each team that would be put up for possible eviction. The Black team nominated Laycon and TrikyTee while the White team nominated Dorathy and Ozo. It is believed that two of the four nominated Housemates will be evicted during the ninth Sunday Live Eviction. Five Housemates are expected to stay during the final week of the show.
