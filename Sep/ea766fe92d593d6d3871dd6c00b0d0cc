As internal crisis continues to rock the Ekiti State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the party’s factional Chairman in the state, Kehinde Odebunmi, has said he will not allow former governor Ayodele Fayose to hijack it. Odebunmi, speaking at the weekend while featuring on a local programme, The Conversation, aired on New Cruse 92.7 FM, Ikere-Ekiti, said other leaders also mattered in the administration of the party. He accused the Uche Secondus-led National Working Committee (NWC) of colluding with Fayose to disallow internal democracy and freedom of choice of leaders. Odebunmi said everything legally and constitutionally possible would be done to prevent Fayose from hijacking the PDP, which he noted belonged to all card-carrying members at the 177 wards. The former National Vice Chairman, PDP, Southwest, Mr. Eddy Olafeso, said Fayose should be respected for saving the party from collapse when the ruling party allegedly plotted internal crisis to destroy it. Olafeso said Fayose towered above other leaders in the zone, judging from his antecedents and contributions to PDP’s electoral fortunes. He added: “Fayose remains the voice of the PDP in the Southwest.” Olafeso, who spoke in Ado-Ekiti while meeting the delegates on his vice chairmanship aspiration for the coming zonal congress of the party, noted that the leadership tussle between Fayose and Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde was unwarranted.
