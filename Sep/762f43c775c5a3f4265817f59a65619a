  Popular broadcaster, Ifedayo Olarinde, known as  Daddy Freeze has apologised to Bishop David Oyedepo, the founder of Living Faith Church worldwide, over the offensive video on him which is currently on social media. Daddy Freeze acknowledged that he never intended to embarrass or malign Bishop Oyedepo, but to correct some doctrinal errors of the Bishop, which he disagrees with, but he has since grown. In his words “My attention has been drawn to a video I release two years ago while addressing some pertinent issues that arose back then. I apologise for the delivery of my message and for any insult to the person of Bishop David Oyedepo. I did not intend to dishonour, disrespect, and disregard the person of Bishop Oyedepo. If you see the intention to the contrary it is regretted. “My method of addressing doctrinal issues have long since evolved to a more scriptural and less confrontational approach. I was and still very passionate in my quest to address what I believe are unresolved doctrinal issues however from a more amiable perspective. “I am of the firm belief that for our faith to thrive we as Christian believers should be open to absorbing new theological and doctrinal frames of reference as against the faith model that is subsumed in unchallengeable beliefs. This I believe can be achieved in love for the furtherance of our faith so help me God.”
