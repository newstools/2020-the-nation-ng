The governorship candidate of the Social Democratic Party, Prince Peter Oyeleye Fasua, has said that he is focused on winning the October 10 governorship election and would not be distracted by activities of the big political parties. Prince Fasua who insisted that there was no crisis within the Ondo SDP described the parallel primaries held by a faction of the party as ‘a get-together party. Fasua who spoke in a chat with our reporter stated that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) recognised his candidacy and issued him the necessary code. He said the SDP adopted the evangelism style of the campaign so as to be able to talk about his policies and programmes to people in their houses. On alleged plans to collapse structure for the APC, Fasua vowed to continue the battle of winning the election to the end. His words, “There is no crisis in SDP. If there is a crisis in SDP, INEC will not issue out code to the party. During my primaries, we were recognised. The primary others had was just a get-together party. The crisis is happening everywhere. It cannot be 100 percent. As long as it is an exercise control by man, the crisis will always happen. “That is what people will be thinking about minor political parties. The merging of political parties happened everywhere. It is never a crime. It happened in Osun State recently. If you are strong in one end and another party is strong in another end, all of you will form a coalition. It is part of politics. “When I compare myself to other contestants, I am ahead of them despite them having access to government money. Whatever is the achievement of the past government, I will do more. I have experience and I know I will do better.”
