 A UNITED Nations (UN) Peace Ambassador Miebi Bribena has said fiscal federalism, resource control and neglect of Niger Delta will be revisited when Seriake Dickson wins the October 31 election to represent Bayelsa West in the Senate. Dickson was returned unopposed as Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate at the weekend primary. Bribena said Dickson was returned unopposed based on his records. He noted that the decision of party faithful underscored his achievements as governor. He insisted the former governor would use his experience as crusader of justice, fairness and equity in the distribution of the countryâ€™s wealth on the floor of the Senate.
