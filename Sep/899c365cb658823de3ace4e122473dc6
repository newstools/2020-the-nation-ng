Award-winning Nollywood Actress, Shan George is engaged and ready to tie the nuptial nut. The movie star, who has been married thrice, shared a picture of her engagement ring and captioned it: “As scared and skeptical as I’ve been all these past years, based on unfavourable past experiences, this one seems to be just too right to be afraid of or to hide. So I SAID YES!! To my best friend, my brother, partner, business associate, fellow Cross Riverian, my ride or die since 1800, my available shoulder to cry on always. Let’s try again this one last time. It’s never too late. Yes, I Love You Too,’ she wrote on Instagram.” The 50-year-old Rivers State-born actress has had her fair share of scandals in recent times. Shan George has two grown sons Delnoi and Jaga.
