 THE candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Edo State governorship election, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, has slammed Governor Godwin Obaseki for allegedly playing politics with people’s health. Ize-Iyamu, in an online statement in Benin by the Chairman of APC Media Campaign Council, Prince John Mayaki, said: “Some of our people travel all the way to Benin City for health care. But they have to pay through their nose because the governor, after politicising the Benin Specialist Hospital, keeping it under lock and key for no other reason except bitter and petty politics, handed it over to some individuals, who are charging the people exorbitant fees, in a hospital built with public fund.” He said the hospital would not have been a double jeopardy, had Obaseki delivered on his promise of building primary health centres in the 192 wards. ”This government promised to build a primary health centre in the 192 wards in four years, but it has built none.  So, residents have to travel several kilometres just to see a doctor,” the APC standard-bearer said. He said such hardship from an “insensitive leader” will exit with Obaseki when he is voted out on September 19.
