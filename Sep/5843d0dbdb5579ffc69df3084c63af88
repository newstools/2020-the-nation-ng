 Mrs. Akpezi Okpidi, the woman who was kidnapped Saturday morning, in Ughelli town of Delta State, has regained her freedom. The Nation learnt that she was rescued around 6:50PM at an undisclosed riverine area, near Burutu Council Area of the state. According to a family source, security operatives tracked two of the suspects to Bayelsa State, where they were apprehended. The duo are said to have died from gunshot wounds.  A third suspect is reportedly on the run. He was said to have escaped with the victim, but may have abandoned her when he noticed that the Police were on to him. It was gathered that the GLK Benz used for the operation was stolen by the suspects, and has also been recovered. The family source told Sunday Nation that no ransom was paid to effect her release. Recall that at about 8AM, Mrs. Okipidi was abducted from her Honda vehicle and whisked away to an undisclosed location, while on the way to her shop. The Delta State Police Command was yet to confirm the development as of the time of filing this report.
