Koreanautomakers Hyundai and Kia are recalling over 600,000 vehicles in the United States and Canada to fix a brake fluid leak that could cause engine fires. The recalls cover more than 440,000 Kia Optima midsize sedans from 2013 through 2015 and Kia Sorento SUVs from 2014 and 2015. Also covered are 203,000 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport SUVs from 2013 to 2015. In Canada, only the Santa Fe Sport is affected; about 52,000 examples are covered there by the recall. The affiliated automakers say brake fluid can leak inside a hydraulic control unit for the anti-lock brakes, possibly causing an electrical short that can lead to fires.  Kia’s recall will start October 15, while Hyundai’s will start October 23. Dealers for both firms will inspect the control units for leaks and replace them if needed at no cost to owners. In company documents posted by U.S. safety regulators, Hyundai said it had 15 reports of engine fires caused by the fluid leaks, while Kia said it had eight. Hyundai said it’s not aware of any injuries, and Kia said it had none. Hyundai said in a statement that there’s no need to park vehicles outdoors before the problem is fixed, but if the anti-lock brake warning light comes on, owners should not drive their vehicles and should contact a dealer. They also should disconnect the 12-volt battery by removing the positive cable, the company said.
