The Obaseki family of Benin Kingdom has reaffirmed support for the re-election of their son and candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Governor Godwin Obaseki. It promised to mobilise other members of the family at home and in the diaspora to ensure the governor’s victory on September 19. William Gaius Obaseki, who spoke in Benin City on behalf of the Obaseki Ogbeide-Oyo family, during the 100th remembrance anniversary of their late patriarch, Agho Obaseki, hoped that the governor’s performance would earn him re-election. He said the family would on September 19 stop all activities to vote for their son, Governor Obaseki, to ensure he emerges victorious. “We want to assure our son that we are solidly behind him. We will support him and ensure he comes out victorious on September 19. It will not just be a victory but a landslide victory for the governor. “Don’t be afraid of anything; forget the rumour that thugs have been imported into the state. We don’t have factories for thugs, but we believe only in God. God gave him victory before and that same God will again give him victory on September 19. God has not failed us before and can’t start it now; victory is sure for our son,” William Gaius Obaseki said. Governor Obaseki said the family has continued to offer great service to Edo people and the monarchy of the Great Benin Kingdom.
