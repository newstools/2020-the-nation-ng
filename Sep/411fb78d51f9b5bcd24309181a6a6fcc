 Operatives of the Ogun State Police command, on Friday morning, shot dead a robbery suspect at the Ijebu-Ife corridor of the Sagamu-Benin expressway. The suspect was killed following a distress call to the police in Ijebu-Ife around 2:45 am that a gang of robbers in military camouflage had blocked the expressway and were dispossessing motorists of their valuables. The Divisional Police Officer for Ijebu-Ife, Raphael Ugbenyo, reportedly mobilised the Special Anti-robbery Squads (SARS) in pursuit of the gang, which opened fire on the police upon sighting them. During the 30-minute confrontation, one of the hoodlums was shot dead while others escaped into the bush with gunshot injuries.  The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in the state, Abimbola Oyeyemi, who disclosed this in a release, stated that two mock guns, a cell phone, assorted charms and a torchlight were recovered from the suspect. The deceased has been deposited in a mortuary as the police intensify efforts to apprehend fleeing members of the gang. The Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, commended his men for their gallantry while appealing to the public, especially hospitals, to alert the police if anyone with bullet injury is seen in their area.
