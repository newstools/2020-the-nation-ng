Aruna Quadri and his teammates at TTC RhönSprudel Fulda-Maberzell were on the losing side in the Table Tennis Bundesliga (TTBL) league opener after going down 3-0 away to TSV Bad Königshofen. Quadri , who was making his debut in the German league was beaten 3-1 by German international Kilian Ort after his teammate Ruwen Filus squandered a 2-0 lead to lose 3-2 against Bastian Steger. Quadri showed his class in the first game winning 11-3 but the next three games proved too tasking for the Nigerian as he fell 8-11, 7-11 and 9-11 to surrender to the German Kilian Ort. A disappointed Quadri told NationSport that they were unlucky to have gone down in the match. “I started very well with 11-3 win in the first set, then in the second set I felt something like I lost concentration and that actually cost me the whole of the match but of course we will come back much stronger. He added:” Also I was a little bit nervous today being my first match. I really cannot explain why I was nervous but I think I was totally out of the game despite winning my first set. I hope to get used to the league in my next game and I promise that we will bounce back in our next game at home.”
