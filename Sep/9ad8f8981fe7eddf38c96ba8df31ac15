Laycon has disclosed he is yet to move on from Erica’s disqualification. The fast- rising artist disclosed this to Trickytee on Monday. He said Erica’s disqualification is one of his saddest moments in the House so far. “I have not recovered from her disqualification,” said Laycon. Speaking further, he also relishes moments with evicted Housemates, Praise and Kiddwaya, saying he misses them around. Erica and Laycon fell apart after Laycon conveyed his feelings to Erica to which she turned down to be with Kiddwaya. Erica was disqualified after she rained insult on Laycon before her exit penultimate Sunday.
