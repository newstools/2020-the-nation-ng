The Chief Medical Director of Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital (NAUTH), Nnewi, Anambra State, Prof. Anthony Igwegbe on Thursday appealed to the striking Joint Health Sector Unions (JOHESU) members to return to work to save lives. He regretted that the strike had crippled activities at the health institution, exposing patients to unnecessary danger. Speaking to reporters in Nnewi, the CMD expressed doctor’s readiness to carry out their duties but said they needed complementary services of other health workers to ensure holistic services were rendered to patients. He explained that some of the patients whose cases could not be handled by the available doctors were referred to Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu University Teaching Hospital, Amaku, Awka, or elsewhere for medical attention. He said, “The strike has impacted negatively on us since it started on Monday. The JOHESU members are very determined this time than ever before to press home their demands. “We beg JOHESU members to return to their duty posts while negotiations continue. Wages can never be satisfactory all over the world and human wants are insatiable. No matter what you earn, it can never be enough.” While disclosing that no casualty had so far been recorded at the hospital due to the strike, Igwegbe however noted that the hospital was not in a hurry to hire help from outside, unless permitted. The CMD was however optimistic of the government soon resolve on the matter.
