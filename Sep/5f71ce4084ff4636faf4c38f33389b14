Super Eagles defender to the Russia 2018 World Cup Leon Balogun has been described as a very neat and tidy player in defense. Since joining Rangers in July from Wigan, Balogun has been impressive with three clean sheets from his three outings for Steven Gerrard’s side and Brighton assistant manager Billy Reid said the Nigerian would continue to impress for Rangers on and off the pitch. “Leon is a bit older but did really well in his first couple of games for Rangers,” Reid told Mail of London. “He probably never got much of a chance at Brighton if I’m honest. We’re just so strong in that department. “Leon’s a quiet guy who doesn’t disrupt the dressing room. He’s very neat and tidy at the back – and has good pace for his age. He did really well at Pittodrie on the opening day and will do well in a Rangers team that doesn’t look like conceding too many goals.” Balogun has made three appearances for the Gers, though injury ruled him out of the Scottish Premiership meetings with Livingston and Kilmarnock last month and he had to make do with a spot on the bench against Hamilton.
