A two million naira Borderless Trade Impact Investment Fund has been launched for Small and Medium Scale (SMEs) entrepreneurs to start or expand their export business. The initiative was launched by a business strategist, Olori Boye Ajayi, in partnership with O.B.A and Viniko Group. Boye-Ajayi also launched her book, Borderless Trade: A Step by Step Guide to Exporting Your Product. She said: “I have written this book because I believe it is time for small businesses to wake up, think differently and package their products and services to the global market. No one will build your business for you; it’s in your hands. “The book is a guide for small businesses which may not have the resources or capacity to approach exporting the same way a larger business might. This guide will assist budding export merchants to prepare and build capacity…” Deputy Director (Corporate Services) at Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) Babatunde Faleke, who spoke on the dangers of not exporting, said: “The danger of not exporting is that we will be a nation that just consumes everything.”
