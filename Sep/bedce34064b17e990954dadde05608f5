 EX-GOLDEN Eaglets striker, Olusegun Olakunle has stressed that the special bonus promised by his Danish club has continued to motivate him to score more goals for BK Fremad Amager in division two. The former ABS FC star began his career with Fremad Amager with a hat-trick in the Denmark DBU Pokalen (Cup) against Boldklubben 1908 two weeks ago and he added  two goals on his league debut in their 6-0 bashing of Vendsyssel FF last weekend. The attacker said he would continue to offer his best to the club while adding that the special bonus entrenched in his contract would motivate him to beat the 15 goals mark set by the club. “I give glory to God Almighty with my five goals in two matches. Actually I wasn’t expecting it but I knew I could do it because every time before going to the pitch, I always believe coupled with the right mindset I must give my best,” Olakunle said.
