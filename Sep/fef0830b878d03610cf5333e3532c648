Mr. Eyo Charles, the Cross River Correspondent of Daily Trust newspaper, was on Monday presented with an award for excellence, by an Abuja-based Non- Governmental Organisation, One Love Foundation International. Presenting the award in Calabar, Mr. Osemudiamen Ogbidi, the Programme Officer of the foundation, said it was in recognition of the reporter’s bravery and commitment to the journalism profession. According to him, the foundation decided to recognise the correspondent in view of his recent encounter with the former Minister for Aviation, Mr. Femi Fani-Kayode, during a press conference in Calabar. “Mr. Eyo is a symbol of a true journalist who suffers undue oppression in the hands of the privileged in the cause of performing his duties. “He was insulted, humiliated and downgraded just for asking a simple question. That is why we are here to honour him and to encourage him and other journalists not to give up. “Gone are the days when people referred to lawyers as the hope of the common man. Today journalists are the hope of the common man,” he said. He urged the correspondent to continue with his exploits in journalism and encouraged others to emulate him. The foundation also presented an award to the Chairman of the State Council of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Mr. Victor Udu. Responding, Charles thanked the foundation for the award, saying that he least expected it. He described the insult and abuse meted out to him by the former minister as unfortunate, adding that he did not mean to embarrass him. “But I have since forgiven him,” Charles said. He commended the Management of Daily Trust, the President of NUJ as well as the union in the 36 states of the federation and the media for their show of solidarity. The reporter added that the award would spur him to work harder.  (NAN)
