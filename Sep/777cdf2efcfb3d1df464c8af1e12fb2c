Serena Williams has hailed the character Andy Murray showed to come through his first-round marathon with Japan’s Yoshihito Nishioka at the US Open. Williams, who also won her own first-round match on Tuesday, was waiting to take to court inside the Arthur Ashe Stadium after the conclusion of Murray’s match. Despite being eager to get her own campaign up and running, she said afterwards she had Murray’s back the whole time. “Usually when you’re waiting for a match, someone is down two sets, you root for the person that’s ahead so you can get on the court,” the 23-time Grand Slam champion said.”It was rooting for Andy the whole time. I really wanted him to win. Gosh, when he was down in the third set, I was like, all right. I was just rooting for him so hard.” Williams and Murray came together for the mixed doubles at last year’s Wimbledon, referring to themselves as ‘Mur-rena’, and Williams recognises the qualities he showed in his 4-6 4-6 7-6 (7-5) 7-6 (7-4) 6-4 victory.She said: “I love his grit. I’ve always loved that, way before we played doubles. I always said he reminds me a lot of myself. I’m just a big fan.”
