The leadership of health workers under the umbrella of Joint Health Sector Unions (JOHESU) has suspended its seven-day warning strike. It directed its members to resume work nationwide from Monday, September 22, 2020. JOHESU stated it called off the strike despite refusal of the Federal Government to address demands of its members as was done to other bodies in the health sector. The union in a statement on Sunday said its next line of action would be decided by the Expanded National Executive Council of JOHESU in due course. In a statement by its National Chairman, Biobelemoye Josiah, JOHESU accused the Federal Government of resorting to intimidation and blackmail instead of calling for dialogue to resolve the trade dispute. JOHESU, on September 13, 2020, had proceeded on strike following the inability of the Federal Government to meet demands of its members. Some of JOHESU’s grievances include: non-implementation of the September 20, 2017 agreement on COHESS adjustment; some court judgments in favour of the union; a review of the implementation of covid – 19 hazard allowance, non-payment of all withheld salaries of members at JUTH, FMC Owerri, LUTH, among others. The statement added: “JOHESU will continue to use all legitimate means to defend the rights and demands for the welfare of its members in the health sector. Nigerian should bear us witness that JOHESU has shown high patriotism by demanding that public health system in Nigeria is sustained and adequately financed for effective, efficient and affordable healthcare delivery. “In view of the above and in line with the resolution of the Expanded NEC meeting held physically and virtually today, Sunday 20, September, 2020, I hereby declare that the 7 days warning strike is suspended. “All our members are directed to resume work by Monday, 21 September, 2020 while awaiting further directives.”
