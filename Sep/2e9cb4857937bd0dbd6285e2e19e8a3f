National Union of Pensioners (NUP) has praised Imo State Governor Hope Uzodimma for correcting the maladministration of past governments. Pensioners, led by National President Abel Afolayan, described the situation in ex-Governor Rochas Okorocha’s tenure as unfriendly. He said Okorocha owed pensioners over N56.4 billion. Afolayan urged Uzodimma to pay pensioners their outstanding arrears. He said recent protest was not by his members. “We believe in dialogue and peaceful negotiation …” he said. Uzodimma said: “I met a cabal when I assumed office. The fraud was huge so we decided on verification to clean up the system. “The work slowed down because of COVID-19. We paid 900 pensioners, remaining 900… Soon we will have a clean nominal pension pay roll to ensure uninterrupted payment.”
