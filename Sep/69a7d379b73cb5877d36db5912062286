A technician, Mohammed Idris Abubakar who defrauds POS Operators posing as a Soldier has been arrested by the Niger state Police Command. Before his arrest, Abubakar had defrauded over 20 POS operators in different locations in Minna, Niger state to the sum of N1, 263,000. His modus operandi is sometimes to pose as one who wants to withdraw money from the POS operator and when the POS machine shows he had been debited, the operator gives him the money while in the actual sense, he was not debited. While in other cases, he goes to shops that use POS and when he uses his card, the owners of the shops receive alerts that they have been paid and give him the goods. The suspect was arrested by police operatives attached to Chanchaga Division following a tip-off. Abubakar when he was paraded confessed that he had a particular device that he uses to effect alert on someone’s account which is not real. He said that he has been on the business of using fake alerts to defraud people for some years and has made a lot of money from the business. “I have made thousands of naira in this business, but the unfortunate thing is that I cannot account for what I have done with the money otherwise I would have left this heinous crime for long, the more I get the money so will I spend It, is quite unfortunate.” The Police Public Relations Officer, Wasiu Abiodun while parading the suspect urged people of the Public especially those who operate POS to be very careful while dealing with customers. He advised them to always verify they have been paid before clearing the customers in order to avoid financial loss in their business.
