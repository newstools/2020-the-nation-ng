 GOVERNOR Aminu Bello Masari of Katsina State has directed the resuscitation of six moribund industries in the state, including NEEMPRO, as part of efforts aimed at improving revenue generation capacity and to create employment opportunities for the teeming population of youths in the state. The State Commissioner for Industries and Commerce, Alhaji Muktar Gidado Abdulkadir, made the disclosure in his office while signing a Memorandum of Understanding on behalf of the state government with Messrs Contec Global Agro Limited for the resuscitation and full utilisation of the state-owned NEEMPRO factory in Katsina. He said: “This process is in line with the restoration agenda of the Masari administration. It is also in fulfilment of the administration’s pledge and commitment to resuscitating all moribund industries in the state and to create more job opportunities and add impetus to the government’s drive of diversifying the revenue base of the state.’’ The Managing Director of Contec Global Agro Limited, Mr. Thomas Chackunkal, in his remark, said the company was encouraged by the persistent determination and commitment of the state government to the resuscitation of the factory. While thanking the state government for finding them worthy of this task, he expressed their commitment to fulfilling their own part of the agreement, adding that they will ensure the full utilisation of all segments of the factory in no time. He said: “We are ready to take care of all the neem trees in the state; we will introduce a cluster and value chain programme in which neem tree growers will be identified and supported with all necessary inputs, with the assurance of buying all the seeds they will grow.” He also proposed to the state government the establishment of a bio-fertiliser factory in the state, as this will bring succour to farmers in the state and beyond and also help generate more revenue and employment.
