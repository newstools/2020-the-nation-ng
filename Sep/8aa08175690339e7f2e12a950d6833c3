 CHALLENGES will come, but no one prays for them. At present, former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode aka FFK, is fighting battles that are capable of consuming the weak. A few weeks ago, he was widely condemned for lashing out at a journalist who asked him an uncomfortable question. The reporter wanted to know the sponsor of his tour of some PDP-controlled states. Now, a fresh controversy has arisen. There are strong indications that his marriage to former beauty queen Precious Chikwendu is in crisis after six years. She’s his fourth wife. He was formerly married to Saratu Atta, Yemisi Olasunbo Adeniji and Regina Amonoo. Fani-Kayode has threatened to sue a blogger over a report alleging domestic violence as the reason for the marital trouble. It is a claim he vehemently denies. The blog had claimed Precious moved out without her sons and that the ex-minister took over the kids, put them under the care of a nanny, and forbade his estranged wife from coming near their house.  Lawyers are demanding that the blogger coughs up a token N2 billion for sullying their clients reputation, and publishes an apology in two national dallies within 14 days. Since the story broke, different reasons have been quoted as responsible for the separation. Apart from the alleged domestic violence, it is also suggested that Precious is battling a health challenge. Meanwhile, the minister’s wife has piped up on social media with a cryptic Instagram post which many are decoding as her take on her marital situation. She posted Psalm 126:1-3 with love emojis: “When the Lord turned against the captivity of the Zion, we were like them that dream. Then our mouth filled with laughter, our tongue with singing: then said among the heathen, The Lord hath done great things for them. The Lord hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.” Well, make of that what you will! Fani-Kayode and Precious’ marriage produced four boys, including triplets.
