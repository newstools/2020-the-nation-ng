 TWO persons died while six  were injured on Monday after a train hit a commercial bus and a Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV) at PWD Bus Stop, Lagos.

Director-General, Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), Dr. Femi Oke-Osanyintolu said six of the victims sustained minor injuries and were treated on the spot by paramedics, while two with severe cases were evacuated to the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH). “However, the adult male lost his life. The two vehicles have been recovered off the road with the aid of the agency’s light rescue equipment while traffic management measures have been put in place by responders including task force officials and police operatives. “The public, especially drivers of commuter buses are reminded to obey traffic regulations to prevent loss of life, injuries and transport delays,” he said. Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, and Minister of Transportation Rotimi Amaechi visited the site, promising to provide better safety measures on the rail line.
