A former publicity secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ondo State, Mr. Banji Okunomo, has resigned his membership of the party. He contested the governorship primary election of the PDP, but got 90 votes. Okunomoâ€™s name was among those presented to the PDP governorship candidate, Eyitayo Jegede, to be picked as running mate, but Jegede refused. He announced his resignation from the PDP at Domfav Hotel in Okitipupa Local Government. Okunomo is said to be heading for the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) to join forces with Dr. Olusegun Mimiko and Agboola Ajayi. He said he was leaving the PDP alongside 15, 000 members across the 18 local governments at a formal declaration to be announced later.
