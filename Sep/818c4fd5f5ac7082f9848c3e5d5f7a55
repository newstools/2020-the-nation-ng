A renowned Professor of Virologist and former Vice-Chancellor, Redeemer’s University, Oyewale Tomori, has called for caution on measures being taken by governments to reopen the economy and educational activities, following a decline in cases of coronavirus infections. He said the reported low cases of the novel virus in the country does not truly represent the actual figure, adding that the truth  was that there was a significant  drop in testing, which accounts for the drop in the cases of infections. Tomori spoke while delivering a lecture titled, “Science and Mis-Science of COVID-19”, to mark the 2020 Annual General Meeting Week of Medical and Dental Consultants Association of Nigeria (MDCAN), University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan chapter on Tuesday. He noted that the series of misinformation and fake news in the social media and the mass media since the disease started and warned governments not to be swayed into making wrong decisions because of misinformation. Decrying the impact of fake news on the socio-economic life of the people since the beginning of the disease, the Professor of Virology warned against complacency both on the part of the government and the citizens.
