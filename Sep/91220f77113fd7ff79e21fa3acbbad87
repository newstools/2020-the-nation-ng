Thus, Heineken’s majority shareholding now stands at 55.9567 per cent, based on available reports. The Nation had reported that market insiders expected Heineken to buy more shares noting that attractive valuation, foreign exchange illiquidity that trapped several foreign investors and the prospects of the Nigerian market were making multinationals with Nigerian know-how to dig in further. The new share acquisitions are significant for the multinationals. Every additional share increases Heineken’s control on the Nigerian subsidiary. The single largest domestic stake in the widely dispersed Nigerian Breweries’ shareholding is 0.44 per cent held by Odutola Holdings Limited. Analysts had said the new acquisitions by multinationals were futuristic, especially with the prospects of a single large African market envisaged by the African businesses under the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). The AfCFTA seeks to create a single continental market for goods and services of African origin with free movements across the member countries. Nigeria has already signed the AfCFTA agreement.
