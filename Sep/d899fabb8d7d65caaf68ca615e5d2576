The Kwara Government has started the second phase of its radio tutorial programmes as other states prepare for the resumption of schools. A statement issued on Monday in Ilorin by Press Secretary, Ministry of Education and Human Capital Development, Mr. Yakub Aliagan, stated that the tutorial programme was for the basic classes and senior secondary students in the state. The statement quoted the Commissioner for Education and Human Capital Development, Mrs. Fatima Ahmed, as saying that the initiative was to reduce the effects of the closure of schools, following the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic in the country. “The programme will go a long way to boost academic morale of students and pupils and also prepare the exit classes for their ongoing examinations. “I, therefore, urge parents and guardians to monitor their wards and encourage them to take advantage of the programme to refresh their memory for better performance in their examinations,” Ahmed said. The statement added that the tutorial would commence on Monday, Sept. 7, on some radio stations including Harmony 103.5 FM Idofian, Radio Kwara FM and Gravity FM Igboho. “Time for the tutorial on Harmony FM 103.5Fm, Idofian is 12 noon to 12:30pm, from Mondays to Fridays, except Tuesdays, which is from 5:00m to 5:30pm. ‘’On Gravity FM, Igboho, the tutorial will start by 1pm to 1:30pm every day. “Radio Kwara would be airing it on Monday by 2pm to 2:30pm, on Tuesday, by 2:30pm to 3 pm, Wednesday, 6:30pm to 7:00pm, Thursday, from 6:30pm to 7:pm and Friday, from 2:30pm to 3:pm respectively,” it stated. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that the Federal Government had on Sept. 3 approved the full reopening of schools but ordered states to conduct a risk assessment, to ensure that all schools were at a level of compliance.
