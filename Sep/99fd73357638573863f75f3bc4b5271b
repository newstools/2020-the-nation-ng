Sixty widows in Ifako-Ijaiye Local Government Area, who were trained in batik making, gift bags production and cakes and confectionaries, graduated on Thursday with a determination to be employers of labour and wealth creators. One of the beneficiaries Mrs Yetunde Oladeinde said the training has opened their eyes to the opportunities that abound in the society. She commended the organisers of the empowerment programme for the initiative which she statedÂ was very beneficial to all trainees because of the simple, practical teaching methods deplored in teaching the widows. The empowerment programme was organised by two Non-Government Organisations Hopewell Initiatives (HI) and Widows Care and Charity Organisation (WICCO). Commending the initiative, Local Government Chairman Apostle Oloruntoba Oke said the council is happy that non-governmental organisations are taking up the gauntlet to empower the vulnerable sectors of the society by giving them wealth creation skills.
