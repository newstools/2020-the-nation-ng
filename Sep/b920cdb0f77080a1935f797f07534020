 THREE persons have died after they reportedly inhaled toxic waste fumes from a Chinese manufacturing company, Wewood Company, in Omotosho, Okitipupa local government area of Ondo State. It was said that the toxic waste spilled over from a pit  into the forest where the three men inhaled its fumes. Those killed were Mr. Akinmusire Monday, 35, Samuel Louis, 45, and Ododolewa Adebowale, 19. Adebowe was among the students writing the ongoing West African Senior School  Certificate Examinations (WASSCE) and was employed as a helper. Louis was the wood contractor, while Monday was the saw operator. The victims were in the forest to fell trees and cut them to size for sale when they breathed in the toxic gas, it was said. A brother of one of the victims said a search party was organised when they trio did not return. A community leader, Akinseye Omololu, said the state government leased the forest to the Chinese company to clear and replant trees. Police spokesman Teo-Leo Ìkorò confirmed the incident, saying it was an accident. He said: “There’s a company producing ethanol in the area, Omotosho, and it was an accident as a result of waste from the company,” he said. “The bodies of the victims of the accident have been deposited in a morgue. But the company and the families of the victims are already talking and making arrangements on the matter. It was an accident.”
