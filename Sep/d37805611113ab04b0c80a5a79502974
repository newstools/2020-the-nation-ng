Trickytee and Dorathy got into a heated argument on Thursday night after Neo won the Indomie ‘Guess the Recipe’ task. Dorathy aired her displeasure about the result, saying Neo didn’t feed her the toppings of the meal during the Indomie ‘Guess the recipe’ Task. Trickytee, who felt Dorathy was overreacting, however, expressed disappointment in her calling her a sore loser. He said: “Everyone still got money. So why are you angry? If anyone is angry they should try cooking and see if they would make that amount of money easily. “I’m not like you, you are a sore loser.” Dorathy however replied asking Trickytee not to insult her because she didn’t insult him. For winning, the Housemates shared N4million as a consolation prize with Neo having the lion share.
