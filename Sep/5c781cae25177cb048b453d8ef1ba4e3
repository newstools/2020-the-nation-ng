 THE Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) has promised to work with other stakeholders in Niger Delta to end oil bunkering. IPMAN said the regular theft of more than 30 per cent of crude freight had affected businesses and led to job losses. National Head of Surveillance, Waterways Botu Emmanuel (Olotu) said IPMAN had a mandate to reorient youths of Niger Delta, particularly those in riverine communities, on the dangers of bunkering. Emmanuel spoke at Abonnema in Akuku Toru Local Government at a ceremony of Rivers State Operations of IPMAN waterways surveillance at the weekend. According to him, IPMAN would control the water, sea patrol or anti-bunkering unit, and ensure deviant and misguided youths were redirected and reoriented. He said: “The misguided youths will be reoriented. We have to re-evaluate them, blend and reorient them into a proper society. We want to groom them and let them know there is a better life besides oil and gas. They should know there is life after bunkering and agitation. “The most important thing is to let them know and prepare them for what is ahead, what the world is doing and where the world is going tomorrow, we want to be able to bring them back to what the world really is.”
