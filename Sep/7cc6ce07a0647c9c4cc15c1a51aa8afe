 A CIRCULAR from the management of the National Assembly has barred workers from Grade Level 10 and below from coming to work. They are now to work from home. This is coming just as lawmakers are preparing to resume plenary after the long annual break. The instruction, according to the management, also affects legislative aides in the same category. They are also to stay away from work until further notice. The memo dated September 11, and titled: “Resumption of work to normal full working hours in the National Assembly”,  was signed by the Acting Secretary, Directorate of Human Resources and Staff Development, Elder Felix Orumwense. “In furtherance to the above objective, I am directed to inform all staff of the National Assembly as detailed below: All staff, including Legislative Aides on Salary Grade Level 12 and above are to resume normal working hours in the office from 8a.m and close at 4p.m on Mondays to Fridays with immediate effect.”
