Following his second strike on Day 54, Dorathy has advised Ozo to focus on the game and let Nengi be. She told Ozo Nengi is a distraction but he keeps going back to her. Dorathy said Ozo has let his feelings get into his head even though he’s not in a relationship with Nengi. “You are like a chicken, you are supposed to be a man. “Nengi is a distraction to you, you know this but choose to remain there for weeks despite the fact that you are not in a relationship. “Why do you keep refusing to make smart decisions? If I advise you now later you would go ahead and do the same thing again. “Henceforth act like a man, you can’t be losing both ways. We are in this House to win.” A third strike for Ozo will get him automatic disqualification.
