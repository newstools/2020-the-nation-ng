 MR. Dotun Ojon, the governorship candidate of Young Progressive Party (YYP), has said citizens should be ready to pay more taxes if Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu is re-elected. He said in a statement made available to reporters in Akure that paying more taxes would further impoverish the people. “As we speak now, salaries are still being owed, while pensioners are not allowed to enjoy the fruit of their labour. “It is curious to note that the government at this time is talking about giving palliatives to political parties, while its core objective is being neglected. “With what was displayed on Saturday, we know the plan of the government is nothing short of taxation – no wonder the only project inaugurated is a tax house.”
