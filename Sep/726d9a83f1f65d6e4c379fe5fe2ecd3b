Kaduna State Chapter of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) has expressed readiness to embrace peace in Southern Kaduna. It also promised to resolve its differences with other tribes in a communiqué at the end of a peace summit in Kafanchan on Sunday. While promising to expose all trouble makers and criminals in their midst and make them face the full wrath of the law, MACBAN also said they were ready to work with others to make the region more peaceful. In the communiqué signed by Kaduna Chairman of MACBAN, Malam Hassan Tugga; Southern Kaduna Zonal Chairman; Malam Abdulhamid Musa; Zonal Secretary, Malam Shuaibu Usman and Director Media and Publicity, Malam Ibrahim Zango, the association urged the Federal and State Governments to compensate victims of communal clashes in the area, who had lost cows and other valuables to ameliorate their sufferings. It also called for the establishment of the community-based security committee with membership from all tribes in the area. The association said: “We have agreed to revert to our olden days’ relationship with our neighbouring communities in Southern Kaduna. “We have resolved to be our brothers’ keeper henceforth in order to foster growth and development in the region. We call on our people to stop allowing underage children from rearing cattle in order to prevent further destruction of the farm produce within the area. “In the same vein, we call on farmers to desist from blocking cattle routes both local and international,” it added. The summit also commended the efforts of security agencies during and after the crisis in maintaining law and order, especially Operation Safe Haven and the police. The peace summit was attended by MACBAN members and other stakeholders in Southern Kaduna, including security agencies and government officials.
