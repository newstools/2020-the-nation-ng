Players within the influencer marketing sector have applauded a new social media app, commending it for enhancing the success of their campaigns. SocialCred is a recently released social media ranking app, which enables users to see how their numbers stack up and what drives these numbers. The app, which is designed as a ranking app rather than just another analytics app, does a fine job of stratifying content creators, influencers, and other social media users by measuring some key metrics and allocating points to each of them. The app measures four key metrics which are follower count, the ratio of original content to shared posts, engagement rate, and audience sentiments. The measure of these four metrics adds up to 100 points for each user, with the engagement rate being where a lot of revelations are made and probably the metric with the most points. SocialCred allows anyone to check the stats of whatever account they like, on YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter, and doing this, the first thing that hits you is that most of the users who appear on the ‘A-List’, ‘Socialite’, and ‘Big Shot’ ranks, have a lower engagement rate compared to those on the ‘Crowd Controller’ or ‘Trend Setter’ rank. These ranks are part of 10 different ranks that the app heaves on anyone who uses it, and the one thing the A-Listers and Big Shots have in common is that they are most likely verified with followers that run into millions or hundreds of thousands. On the flip side, Trend Setters and Crowd Controllers all seemed to have fewer followers, usually between tens of thousands, and lower range hundreds of thousands. Interestingly, as the follower numbers went up for people within the rank, the engagement reduced. They also seemed to have more original content to their names than the content they shared or retweeted.
