The Multi-platinum selling artist, songwriter, and entertainer, Darey Art Alade, shocked fans on Monday when he released his new Extended Play (EP) project, ‘Way Home’. The ‘Pray for Me’ crooner had been dropping new music projects back to back since August when he broke his five-year hiatus with the hot single, ‘Jah Guide Me’. Leading the EP is a tune with Patoranking titled ‘Jojo’ which is available to stream on all online platforms. Announcing the project in an endearing message to fans via his social media, Darey said, “After a lot of sweat and sleepless nights in the kitchen, my brand new EP, ‘Way Home’ is finally ready.” The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that in August, the singer released a Pheelz-produced single, ‘Jah Guide Me’.
Speaking on the inspiration behind the song, he said, “Just like many of you, 2020 has so far, brought a handful of uncertainties on my way. “But the fact is that God isn’t surprised. So I guess it’s up to all of us to submit and be led,” he wrote on his Instagram page. Darey’s last released two singles ‘Asiko Laiye’ (Remix), featured Olamide, and ‘Pray For Me’ featured Soweto Gospel Choir in 2015. Both tracks were instant hits. Darey released his fifth studio album titled Naked in October 2015. The 13-track album comprised afrobeat, soul, and R&B collaborations with Asa, Olamide and the multiple Grammy award-winning Soweto Gospel Choir. The ‘Not the Girl’ singer is also a coach on singing competition, The Voice Nigeria. The seasoned vocalist will officially join other music stars such as Waje, Yemi Alade, and Falz on the panel. He also runs Livespot, a Lagos-based integrated Communications firm with offices in Abuja, along with his wife, Deola. (NAN)
