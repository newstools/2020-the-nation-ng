 RIVERS State Commissioner for Sports, Boma Iyaye,  is impressed by the level of work done at the Adokiye Amiesimaka Stadium in  Igwuruta-Ali, Port-Harcourt as well as the renovation work at Rivers United Football Club Camp in Port Harcourt. Iyaye, accompanied by the Ministry’s Permanent Secretary, Sir Honour Sirawoo, during a routine inspection tour added that he has received assurances from the contractors that the 38,000 capacity edifice would be ready in time for the new Nigeria Professional Football League(NPFL) season. The Yakubu Gowon Stadium, which had previously hosted the state’s owned football clubs, Rivers United and Rivers Angels, is currently being used as an isolation center for COVID-19 patients. “I am impressed with the rate at which the rehabilitation is going on,” Iyaye said. “The contractor has assured us that he will deliver on schedule and of good quality; with what we have seen so far, he will meet the deadline.” He also thanked Governor Nyesom Wike for the seriousness he attaches to issues surrounding sports; the reason he said, has made the State host several local, national and international competitions. “We must give kudos to Governor Nyesom Wike, he doesn’t joke with sports-related issues and you can all see the result. We have some of the best sporting facilities and you can see that we have hosted a lot of events,” he stressed.
