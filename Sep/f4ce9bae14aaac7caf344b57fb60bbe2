Delta Deputy Governor, Kingsley Otuaro, has expressed apprehension over the high level of insecurity in the Niger Delta region. He said insecurity is a threat to national life, adding that efforts must be geared towards securing the region. Otuaro stated this when he received members of the Niger Delta Dialogue led by Judith Asuni at Government House, Asaba. Otuaro said, “The phenomenon of insecurity is known all over the world, and in the Niger Delta region it was more worrisome because the results were not commensurate with the efforts made by government and stakeholders as it is like a dialogue of the deaf,” adding that, “Government and relevant stakeholders in the Niger Delta project cannot afford to relax over the issue of insecurity but must continue in order to have a secured region.” He said that the Niger Delta region was very critical to the nation’s development because of its rich oil resources which he said, was the mainstay of the national economy. He called on stakeholders to muster the will power to do those things that were pivotal to peace in the Niger Delta. The Niger Delta Dialogue spokesperson, Judith Asuni said that the group had six reports on insecurity in the Niger Delta after concluding its thorough research on the region.
