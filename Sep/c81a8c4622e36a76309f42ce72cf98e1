 DICKSON Iroegbu’s latest flick, The Good Husband, is set for cinema release on November 13. The film, which was originally scheduled for an April 17 release, was rescheduled for November as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Good Husband, a movie that explores the challenges that come with marriages is produced and directed by Iroegbu. The film features Sam Dede, Monalisa Chinda, Francis Duru, Thelma Okoduwa-Ojiji, Paul Sambo, and Bassey Ekpo Bassey. It also has in its cast Eeefy Ike and Shield Nwazuruahu.  ‘The Good Husband’ tells the story of a marriage counselor, who is committed to the success of other people’s marriages, but allows his passion to drive a wedge into his home − a generous case of taking the log out your eyes before the spec in your neighbour’s eyes. Iroegbu has produced and directed over twenty blockbuster movies that include Women’s Cot, Critical Condition, Unfaithful, Romantic Attraction, and The Mayors.
