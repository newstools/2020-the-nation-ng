United Airlines has announced plans to expand its global route network with a new, non-stop service between Nigeria and the United States. Starting in late Spring 2021, United Airlines will become the only airline serving Washington, D.C. non-stop from Lagos, with three weekly flights. The new service marks United’s return to Nigeria which the airline previously served up until 2016. “We are excited to announce our return to Nigeria. This new nonstop service will strengthen our international route network and provide our customers from Nigeria with direct access to the United States and the possibility to connect via our Washington Dulles hub to destinations across the Americas ,” said Marcel Fuchs, United’s Managing Director International Sales. “Connecting Lagos to the U.S. will open up new opportunities for both business and leisure travelers and help our customers in Nigeria reconnect with friends and family around the world.” The new route is subject to government approval and tickets will be available for purchase on united.com and the United app in the coming weeks. United’s new service from Lagos to Washington Dulles will be operated with Boeing 787-8 Dream liner aircraft.
