 THE Federal Government has threatened to shut down schools that fail to comply with COVID-19 protocols developed for the safe reopening of schools. Minister of State for Education Emeka Nwajiuba stated this on Monday during a briefing by the Presidential Task Force on Covid-19, in Abuja. He stated that preparations being made by states ahead of the reopening of schools were in order as it was what the federal government expected from state governments. The task force last week asked state governments to undertake a risk assessment ahead of the full reopening of schools. Nwajiuba stated: “This is exactly what we expected from what the PTF chairman issued last week that that guidance would now happen and everybody should then begin the processes of reopening. However, they must be guided. They must meet the provisions that we require.”
