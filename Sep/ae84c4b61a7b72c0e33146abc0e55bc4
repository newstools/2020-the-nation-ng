 THE Ohanaeze Youth Council (OYC) has rejected plans to re-introduce the proposed National Water Resources Management Bill by the National Assembly. National President Igboayaka O. Igboayaka, who spoke in Owerri yesterday, urged lawmakers of Igbo extraction, and Southern Nigeria legislators, to reject the bill ‘as it seeks to promote the expansionist agenda of grabbing lands and depriving indigenous fishermen and farmers of their sources of living’. Igboayaka wondered why the Federal Government would impose the bill on Nigerians despite its rejection. He said the bill was first sent to the National Assembly in May 2017, debated by the lower chamber in July 2017, and rejected by the Bukola Saraki-led Eghth Senate. The proposed bill, currently before the Ninth Senate, if passed into law, will transfer ownership of every lake, river, including the creeks or ancestral waters, to the Federal Government. It will repeal the Water Resources Act and encroach on the land and other heritage of the Eastern people. Igboayaka said: “We regret that at a time the country, particularly the South, is demanding restructuring and devolution of power, the Federal Government is seeking ways to arrogate more power to itself to annex and control state resources… “Revisiting the controversial bill as an Executive Bill, from the Presidency, seeks to place exclusive control of the country’s water resources, including rivers and lakes across states, under the Federal Government. It is a strategy for dispossession, which is not what the country needs now”
