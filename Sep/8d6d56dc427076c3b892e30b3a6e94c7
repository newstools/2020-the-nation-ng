 IMO State Commissioner for Environment Iyke Njoku has urged those working to unseat Imo State Governor Hope Uzodimma to channel their resources to more fruitful ventures as ‘no power can remove Uzodimma from office’. Njoku, who is Uzodimma’s kinsman, spoke at Aboh Mbaise council headquarters when a 2019 governorship candidate of Action Democratic Party (ADP), Obioma Akagburuonye, defected to All Progressives Congress (APC). He said: “Nobody can remove Governor Hope Uzodimma from Douglas House, irrespective of the machinations by our opponents. Uzodimma came into power through God; anybody plotting anything against him will fail.” The commissioner vowed that APC, under Uzodimma’s leadership, would no longer allow power slip from its hands. He praised Akagburuonye for joining the party, saying his move would save Mbaise people from perennial political mistakes. “We, as Mbaise people, took big risks in the past by putting all our eggs in one basket. But with people like Akagburuonye coming into APC, Mbaise won’t be found wanting anymore,” Njoku said. Akagburuonye said he was joining APC to work with  leaders to develop the state. He urged party members not to see him as a threat, and the opposition not to see him as an opponent because his defection was God-ordained. He promised to use his membership to emancipate his people.
