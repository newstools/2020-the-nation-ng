Director-General, Office of Education Quality Assurance Mrs. Abiola Seriki-Ayeni and her evaluators have embarked on COVID-19 safety and hygiene compliance monitoring exercise to ensure that schools in Lagos State adhere strictly to the guidelines on safe reopening of schools as specified by the Federal Government. This is in a bid to ensure safety in schools during the West African Senior School Certificate Examinations (WASSCE). The exercise, which cut across the state education districts, is to supervise the WASSCE examinations to guard against malpractice and to ensure that public and private schools meet the recommended safety standard for reopening. The evaluators are also to assist schools objectively in assessing the level of safety and security and help to clearly identify areas of improvement while encouraging them to take concrete steps in addressing identified gaps. Mrs. Seriki-Ayeni said the reopening compliance monitoring has helped schools to carry out revision lesson to prepare students for the examinations and prevented the spread of COVID-19 infection among learners through the use of face mask, washing of hands with soap and running water, maintaining social distancing as well as the use of hand sanitiser.
