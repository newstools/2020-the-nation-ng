 AFTER three months of physical exertion of spiritual creativity, Ediomo Akpan has emerged winner of the season 2 of the reality TV show, Hymnodia 2020. Akpan smiled home with a brand-new car, Asaph, and the sum of N5 million. The symbolic Asaph, which is designed in Nigeria, finished in Spain, and manufactured in China tells what Hymnodia stands for. Only one is given out each year.  Duke Asuquo was the first runner up while Yinka Odunayo came second and Frank Okoye, third. After 12 stanzas, Ediomo Akpan, Frank Okoye, Johnson Ikpeama aka Json, Duke Asuquo, and Yinka Odunayo came out as top 5 hymntestants. Json eventually lost out to Yinka in the ‘battlenodia.’ Speaking on his victory, Akpan popular called the puppet master said, “I give God the glory. This is just the grace of God. The journey has not been easy but I am grateful. We had wonderful people all around us. I thank the judges, the organisers, everyone. To Duke, Yinka, Frank, and Jason, I love you guys. We are all winners.”
