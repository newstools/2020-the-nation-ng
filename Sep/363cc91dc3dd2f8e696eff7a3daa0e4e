 The  National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS), Ogun State Joint Campus Committee (JCC) has urged Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun to reduce the tuition fee of each school in the state to mitigate the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic instead of sharing money or food as relief materials. “Instead of giving us palliatives in terms of cash, rice, garri and beans, we want him to convert it to a significant reduction in our tuition fee because that will go a long way for  all students, ” Comrade Tomiwa Bamgbose, the chairman of NANS Ogun JCC, said during a post- COVID-19 sensitisation. He noted that  it was  necessary to equip the 13 Students Union leaders  in the state with buses. “The leaders of the students in the  state will always have reasons to move from one place to another,” he added. He appealed to the state government to provide the enabling environment for schools to reopen. “In relation to the theme of the programme, one of the ways to stop the spread of the coronavirus is to maintain social distancing but the infrastructural capability of our institutions will make it difficult to achieve. “We want the governor to fulfil  the promises he made during his  campaign. It is time for him to do so. “We are not asking for money, neither are we asking for gold nor silver. We require facilities and conditions that will  make learning bearable and suitable for students,” he said.
