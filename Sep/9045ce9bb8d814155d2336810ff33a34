Nigeriaâ€™s tertiary education sector was faced with two dilemmas- ASUU and COVID-19- when they were shut in March 2020. While ASUU has been a recurring decimal, COVID-19 came upon the institutions like a thief in the night. While COVID-19 is relapsing, ASUU continues unabated, leaving many students wonder when they will be back on campuses. In the last decade, no graduate of tertiary institutions had lost less than seven months to strikes. Before the lockdown, ASUU had been on strike for over three weeks. So, will closure of schools continue? The answer lies in the hands of Government meeting the needs of ASUU but this time it should be treated to the roots. ASUU is making demands for two things: safe learning environment for students and 2009 subvention. This time should we be looking back to 2013 when higher institutions were on strike for over a year?
