Wanted Benue gang leader Terwase Akwaza alias Gana has been killed. While the military said he was killed in a gun battle with operatives, Governor Sam Ortom alleged he was seized from a convoy of repentant militants on its way to the Government House for a peace meeting. Commander of the Four Special Forces command, Doma local government area, Brigadier General Maude Ali Gadzama, confirmed Gana was gunned down in a battle with operatives. But Ortom accused soldiers of abducting Gana from a Government convoy of repentant militants in Gboko. The Nation had reported Gana surrendered on Tuesday with 172 militia boys in Katsina-Ala local government in Benue. They were on their way to Makurdi when they were intercepted by military officials, Ortom alleged.
