Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki has assured the people that he and his deputy, Philip Shaibu, will perform better in their second term than they are doing in the first term. He said his administration will work for peace to pave the way for greater development of the state. Obaseki spoke yesterday at Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium in Benin, then state capital, during the thanksgiving service organised by the state chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) for him and Shaibu. He said: “The victory is to show us that we must continue to do what we have been doing through sacrifice and service. God willing, we will do more than we did in our first term. “We will continue to do things that will be pleasing in the sight of God and the people of our great state. I also assure everyone that we will work to create peace and harmony, without which we cannot continue to develop our state.”
