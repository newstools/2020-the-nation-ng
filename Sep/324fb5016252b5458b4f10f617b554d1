 The continuous reform and revision of the nation’s laws are key measures for the enhancement of access to justice, the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Justice Minister Abubakar Malami as well as the Chairman of Nigerian Law Reform Commission (NLRC), Prof Jummai Audi, have said. They spoke in Abuja when Malami inaugurated the ninth commission. The AGF, who hailed the commission for ensuring that the nation’s laws are in tune with current realities, added that no democratic society can survive without continuous review of its legislation. “The importance of law reform cannot be over-emphasised because of its relevance to the socio-economic and political development of any nation. “It is uniformly agreed that law, as an instrument of social engineering, always served as the instrumentality of meaningful reform in any civilised society. “I wish to appreciate the efforts and determination of the NLRC in achieving its mandate through the delivery of quality law reform to strengthen governance of the nation and for aligning itself with the economic recovery growth plan of the Federal Government,” Malami said. Audi expressed delight at her appointment as the first woman Chairman of the NLRC. She hailed President Muhammadu Buhari and Malami for the appointment. The NLRC chief stressed the need for the National Assembly to pass the commission’s Amendment Act to enhance its effectiveness. “The Amendment Bill contains new provisions that, if passed into law, will reposition the commission for effective delivery of quality law reform and create a more formidable synergy with other relevant sectors in the society,” she said. Audi, who assured that he commission would not fail in its responsibilities, said the current review of the nation’s laws would be completed next year. The ninth commission of the NLRC included Prof. Audi (Chairman), Dr. Muhammad M. Aminu (Secretary), Bassey Dan-Abia and Muhamad B. O. Ibraheem (members).
