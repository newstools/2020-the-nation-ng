A socio-political group, Ekiti Democrats Agenda (EDA), said on Thursday that Governor Kayode Fayemi has regained the state’s lost glory in all sectors of governance. The group, in a statement in Ado-Ekiti by its Publicity Secretary, Eniola Fadipe, after a tour of ongoing project sites, hailed Dr. Fayemi for executing life-changing projects aimed at improving people’s living conditions. Among the project sites visited include the ultramodern Oja Oba Market Complex, Ikun Diary Farm, College of Agriculture, Isan Ekiti; Agbado-Ode-Isinbode-Omuo, Ijan-Ire-Ilupeju and Oye-Isan-Iye-Ikun road projects. Others were secretariat complex projects, the civic centre and Water Corporation headquarters building project at Ilokun.
