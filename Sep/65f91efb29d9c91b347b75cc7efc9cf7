Son of Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, Babajide, has threatened to sue Ondo State Deputy Governor, Agboola Ajayi, over allegations that he (Babajide) collected N403m as consultancy fees from the N43bn found stashed in a bank. Agboola who is the governorship candidate of the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) made the allegation at party’s flag off campaign rally at Ore in Odigbo local government area. Babajide in a statement said the unsubstantiated claim and accusation, designed to mislead the general public and calculated to malign his person for cheap political gain was not only wicked, treacherous and false but clearly defamatory. Akeredolu’s son said he does not hold any political office adding that the allegation existed in the mind of Agboola. He denied collecting N403m as consultancy fees. His words, “The statement by Hon. Agboola Ajayi was calculated to disparage my person and credibility and it has caused severe damage to my reputation and professional interests. “In light of the above, I have instructed my Lawyers to institute legal action against Hon. Agboola Ajayi to claim full damages for the harm the false and malicious statement he made has done to my reputation. He must prove this allegation in the court of law. “If there is any modicum of honesty in the ZLP candidate, I expect that he shows clear willingness to do the honourable thing by stripping himself of his immunity and accept the court process and prove his claims in court of Law.”
