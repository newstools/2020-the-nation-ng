 ONDO State chapter of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has raised the alarm over alleged purchase of Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) from commercial motorcyclists popularly called Okada riders and traders. It, however, urged the Okada riders and traders to collect the money, as it belongs to them, saying they should on October 10 use their PVCs to vote out Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu and the All Progressives Congress (APC). Spokesman for Ondo PDP Kennedy Peretei, in a statement told the commercial motorcyclists that selling their PVCs would further impoverish them and deny them their social responsibility. He urged the Okada riders and others being enticed to submit their PVCs for financial inducement, to be vigilant and use their votes to advance development. . The statement said: “PDP believes that such financial inducement in exchange for their PVCs is illegal. We cannot discourage them from collecting the money, as it is ‘their money.’ “Such money ordinarily should be used for the development of the state, but the failed government feels that using it for financial inducement is the best thing to do at this time. “We appeal to the people who are being enticed with this Greek gift to collect it and use their PVCs to send out the APC- led government from the Government House, Alagbaka on October 10.” But APC spokesman Alex Akalejaiye said the party does not need to collect PVCs before winning the election. He urged the PDP to withdraw from the race before it led its unsuspecting supporters on an endless ego trip. “From all indications, the coast is clearer for us each day beyond the imagination of these pretenders. First, they thought our party would implode after the primary election, but nothing happened. “All stakeholders are now together, united for Aketi. The cry is as a result of their defeated hopes, dashed expectations and almost truncated desires.”
