 LEADERS of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and All Progressives Congress (APC) have differed over violence ahead of the September 19 governorship election. PDP leaders, through the Chairman of the partyâ€™s chapter in Akoko-Edo Local Government, Don Umoru, at a news conference in Benin, alleged that APC leaders were behind the violence in the state. They alleged that APC former national chairman Comrade Adams Oshiomhole and the governorship candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, were behind the shooting of 13 PDP members, who were holding a meeting at Ekpe in Akoko-Edo Local Government. The PDP leaders also alleged that three persons wearing fez caps with the photograph of Governor Godwin Obaseki were shot by gunmen at Ososo, also in Akoko-Edo Council. They said the victims were still receiving treatment at an undisclosed hospital. The PDP leaders implored President Muhammadu Buhari and the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Muhammed Adamu, to rescue them and ensure that the perpetrators are arrested and prosecuted. APC leaders, reacting through the Chairman of the Media Campaign Council, Prince John Mayaki, alleged that the attacks were masterminded by PDP members.
