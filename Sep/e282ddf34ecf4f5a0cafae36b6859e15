Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland Gani Adams on Wednesday raised the alarm for the second time within four weeks that armed terrorists have occupied Kishi and the vast Old Oyo National Park in Oke-Ogun area of Oyo State. In a statement by his Special Assistant on Media, Kehinde Aderemi, Adams said he had informed the Oyo State Government, Alaafin of Oyo and other relevant stakeholders in security of the area. Contacted, the Special Adviser on Security to Governor Seyi Makinde, Mr. Fatai Owoseni, said the claim was not an issue to fret about. However, residents of Kishi confirmed the claim to The Nation yesterday evening, saying no fewer than 11 motorcyclists were attacked and kidnapped by the suspected terrorists in the town yesterday. The residents confided in The Nation that the issue had prompted an emergency security meeting in the area, with a decision taken on how to address the situation. Adams said the occupation of the massive game reserve in Kishi and another part of Oke-Ogun was a great threat to the entire Southwest. He said the armed criminals have engaged in kidnapping of locals, besides threatening their livelihood and access to forest resources. Adams said children, the aged and women are the most hit by the violent activities of the armed groups.
