 OPERATIVES of the Lagos State Police Command have arrested six suspects over the murder of a 35-year-old man, Kayode Olorunroba. Olorunroba, a resident of 3, Werewere Street, Alagbado was killed on Friday night at AVID Sharwama Spot, during an altercation with another customer. It was gathered that the unnamed customer shot  Olorunroba in the presence of his friend, Kazeem Okikiola, who lured the deceased to the Sharwama spot. According to the police, the shooter fled the scene and Okikiola failed to report the incident to police. He was said to have rather taken Olorunroba to a herbalist in Ogun State where they extracted the pellets and thereafter took him to his brother’s house at Ipaja where he died. But discreet investigation directed by Commissioner of Police Hakeem Odumosu led to the arrest of a suspect identified as Olayinka Oyedokun while five others, Chimezie Amaechi, Okikiola Kazeem, Femi Victor, Taiwo Morokola, and Omole Wasiu- were also apprehended.
