Ondo Deputy Governor and candidate of the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) Agboola Ajayi has stated his ambition is a divine arrangement whether his Ijaw kinsmen voted for him or not. Ajayi said he would still win the election as ordained by God. He spoke at a meeting with leaders of the Ijaws in Ondo State under the auspices of Aruogbo Ijaw Development Association. Ajayi reportedly told the Ijaw leaders: “I’ve seen it all. I have been a supervisor, council chairman, member of the House of Representatives and I’m now deputy governor. “Even if the whole of Arogbo Ijaws doesn’t vote for me, I will be governor if God says I will be Governor. So you should mind the way you address me”. An Ijaw leader at the meeting said Ajayi sought audience with them apparently to secure an endorsement at the meeting facilitated by former National secretary the Ijaw National Congress (INC), Chief Francis Williams. The Ijaw leader, who pleaded anonymity, said some youths engaged Ajayi in the distribution of contracts and projects in Ese-Odo Local Government Area. He said Ajayi did not offer explanations on the issues raised, including his involvement in the legal tussle around a land dispute between the Arogbo Ijaws and Kiribo, Ajayi’s community. Chief Williams told The Nation the association is apolitical and ready to receive any candidate. Williams said they presented a blueprint to Ajayi on the development of Aruogbo Ijaw and Ajayi told them his project has a divine mandate. He said: “The Deputy Governor said his own project has a divine arrangement whether anybody supports him or not. He said he will be there if Arougbo Ijaw voted for him or not. “What he said depends on interpretation because some leaders there are members of political parties. Maybe he was giving God all the glory.” On whether the group adopted Ajayi, Williams said a voice vote agreed he (Ajayi) is their son.
