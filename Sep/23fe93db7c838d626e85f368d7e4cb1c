 BAYERN MUNICH started the defence of their Bundesliga title in ominous fashion as a Serge Gnabry hat-trick helped them to a stunning 8-0 win over Schalke at the Allianz Arena on Friday. A mere 26 days after winning the Champions League, Hansi Flick’s side showed no signs of tiredness and powered into a fourth-minute lead thanks to Gnabry’s superb strike. That was added to by Leon Goretzka after 19 minutes before Robert Lewandowski swept home a third from the penalty spot shortly after the half-hour mark. Gnabry completed his hat-trick with two goals inside the opening 15 minutes of the second half before Thomas Muller, Leroy Sane – making his debut following his July move from Manchester City – and 17-year-old Jamal Musiala completed Schalke’s humiliation. Bayern started in blistering fashion as Gnabry controlled Joshua Kimmich’s long pass over the top, turned away from his marker with a deft turn and whipped a superb left-footed strike past Ralf Fahrmann from 18 yards. Flick’s side bamboozled Schalke’s backline with relentless pressure and the hosts were unsurprisingly undone again shortly before the midway point of the first half when Goretzka slotted home from the edge of the penalty area after being picked out by Muller. Lewandowski – who scored 55 goals in all competitions last season – opened his account for the 2020-21 campaign from the spot in the 31st minute after he had been brought down by Ozan Kabak, while Niklas Sule crashed an effort against the post shortly before the interval.
