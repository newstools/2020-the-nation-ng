  Health workers under Joint Health Sector Unions (JOHESU) have called on Minister of State for Labour and Employment Festus Keyamo to intervene in the dispute between them and the Federal Government. JOHESU Chairman Bio Josiah accused the Federal Government of short-changing members in the payment of COVID-19 Inducement Allowances. He said the Federal Ministry of Health ought to ensure that the payment of 40 per cent or 50 per cent COVID-19 Special Inducement Allowances to health workers in Isolation Centres, FHIs or other related health facilities was done without discrimination.  “The Federal Government did not ensure total and full implementation of the July 1 agreement with JOHESU when it disbursed the third tranche of the allowance for June, which makes it absolutely impossible to guarantee industrial harmony…” “It is rational logic to put on the table that infecting viruses will not differentiate who clinical or non-clinical staff is in the various Health Institutions before it strikes anybody victims.”
