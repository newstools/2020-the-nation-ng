Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Gabriel Olonisakin, on Wednesday said senior officers who use government funds or those who hold positions of responsibility must be accountable to the public. Olonisakin restated his call for accountability among officers of the Armed Forces at the opening ceremony of a two-day workshop titled:  Compliance With Asset Declaration and Code of Conduct, held for senior officers of the Defence Headquarters in Abuja. He said: “This seminar is important, especially for you senior officers who not only draw funds from government’s coffer but are also responsible for the resources at your disposal. As I have always stressed, every officer who holds a position of responsibility must also be accountable. You are also aware that accountability is one of the cornerstones in the fight against corruption, which is one of Mr. President’s Three-Point Agenda. “As I have been rightly informed, one of the objectives of this workshop is to educate and sensitise officers and men of the Armed Forces of Nigeria on the Code of Conduct and other constitutional responsibilities. As members of the Armed Forces, strict compliance with the provisions of the Code of Conduct is an opportunity to express a transparent stewardship in our day-to-day activities. “It is my belief, therefore, that at the end of this two-day workshop, you would have acquired sufficient knowledge and reasons why you must be compliant in your asset declarations and other requirements of the Code of Conduct Bureau.”
