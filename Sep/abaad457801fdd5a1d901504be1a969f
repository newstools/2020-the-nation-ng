Billionaire, Terry Waya has revealed his plans if his son Kiddwaya wins the N85m grand prize for the lockdown edition. Terry Waya said his son doesn’t need the N85million price even if he wins, adding the money would be used for charity. During live interview with media mogul, Dele Momodu, Terry Waya said he would make sure the money is split into two and give one half to Erica because she got disqualified trying to defend his son while the other half would be used for charity. “My son does not need BBNaija money, we will give it to charity if he wins,” Terry Waya said.
