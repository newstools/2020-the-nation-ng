 SOME youths on Tuesday rampaged through Osogbo, the Osun State capital, following the death of a suspected internet fraudster. The Nation gathered that the suspect died when operatives of the Joint Task Force chased a car in which he and three others were riding until the vehicle veered off the road and hit an electric pole. The fraud suspect was the only who died while others reportedly sustained serious injuries, it was learnt. The protesters dumped the body in front of the state Government House, Oke-Fia. Later the youths mobilised on commercial bikes, armed with clubs and sticks and attacked commuters, policemen and traffic wardens. The attack by the rampaging youths caused residents to run for safety. There was heavy gridlock along Alekuwodo, Old Garage, Estate roads. At about 6:50pm the youths waylaid a JTF patrol vehicle as the operatives shot in the air to scare them away. The youths damaged the windscreen of the van and were planning to set it ablaze at the time filing this report. They barricaded Alakuwodo Road with tyres. Special Adviser to the governor on Security Matters, Mrs Abiodun Ige, who oversees the Joint Task Force, said, “I don’t have details now, I am still moving around. If I have full details I will brief you.” A 49-year-old man identified as Rotimi Oluwadabira was arraigned before an Osun State Magistrates’ Court, Osogbo for posing as a soldier and creating fear in the minds of people.
