His Majesty, Ogiame Ikenwoli, the Olu of Warri, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to ensure funds are available for the continuation of the Koko-Ogheye Road project, kick-started by the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), in 2010. The traditional ruler while on an on-the-spot inspection of the 15.4 kilometre- road project in Koko, the administrative headquarters of Warri North council area of Delta State, noted that there would  be many economic gains for residents, private firms, as well as government, on completion. The monarch further expressed dissatisfaction with the contractor handling a shore protection project in the old port town, calling for the termination of the job, which is reportedly being executed by a company linked to a seating South East governor. Lamenting the decade-long abandonment of the project, the monarch disclosed that the project was conceptualised far back in 1955 in the national master plan as a coastal road leading to Nigeria’s commercial hub, Lagos State. Ogiame said, “I’m very happy I have been able to come and inspect this project. The project has been long, since 1955 actually. From the survey, we know that the work can be done from here to Ogheye. “This is a very critical community in our kingdom, but it didn’t start until recently, when Levant got the job. We want to appeal to government to fund Levant, so that they can continue with the job and move back to site. As you can see, the site has been abandoned because there is no funding. “Additionally, this road is going to open the neighbouring communities to a lot of projects. By the time this project is finalized, maybe to a dual carriageway, it will be better for not only Itsekiri communities, but my Ijaw brothers from Egbema kingdom.
