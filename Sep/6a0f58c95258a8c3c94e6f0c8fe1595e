 ILORIN-BASED golfer, Oyedele Ibitayo is excited when he received nomination into ‘Who is Who in Nigeria Golf’, a 500 page book jointly produced by Nigeria Golf Federation (NGF) and Abuja-based printing firm, Marvelous Mike Press Limited. The book which was packaged by Nigeria’s foremost golf writer Tony Akhigbe is The Hall of Fame on Nigeria golfers who offered selfless services to impact on the game’s development. However, Ibitayo who has impacted on the Ilorin Club he joined five years ago in tournament sponsorships and infrastructural development became eminently qualified to be among 250 nominees listed in the historical book. Ibitayo, an employee of the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) said he was totally shocked when he was listed in the Hall of Fame book. “When I first heard about ‘Who is Who in Nigeria Golf’, I thought it would be for golfers mainly in Abuja and Lagos. But for nomination to get to a place  like Ilorin  Golf Club which many consider as remote shows that those behind the project did a marvelous job in carrying Nigeria golfers along irrespective of where they reside. I will say I totally cherish this nomination. Something like this will encourage me to render more services to my Club,” Ibitayo said.
