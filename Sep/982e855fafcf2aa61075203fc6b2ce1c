As hearing in the case filed by Maryam Sherif, the divorced wife of Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, for custody of their children resumed on Wednesday at the Upper Area Court in Kubwa, Abuja, the defence still failed to produce its final witness. Abubakar is the son of Nigeria’s former Vice-President of the same name. Sherif had filed the suit against Abubakar at the Upper Area Court in Gudu, Abuja, but the matter was transferred to the Upper Area Court in Kubwa. She is praying the court to grant her the custody of their three sons. When the matter resumed on Wednesday, counsel to the defendant, Abdullahi Hassan, was not in court but sent Isah Suleiman with a letter to the court that he could not make it because he lost an uncle and had to travel for the burial. In the letter, which was read in court, Hassan urged the court to adjourn till October 7, 2020. The defence was to produce the witness in court, following their failure at the previous sitting as they said the witness was in Dubai. The plaintiff’s counsel, Nasir Saidu, urged the court to ignore the letter and allow him address the court on point of law so that judgment could be delivered on the matter. Saidu said the letter was ill-motivated and a further plan to delay the matter. The judge, Justice Bashir Dansule, declined the request of the defence and adjourned the matter till September 22, 2020 for definite hearing. He ordered the defence to produce their final witness in court or the request of the plaintiff’s counsel would be granted.
