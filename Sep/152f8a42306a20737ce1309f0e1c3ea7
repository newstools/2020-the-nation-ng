A member of the House of Representatives representing Oyo Federal Constituency, Prince Akeem Adeyemi, has reiterated the need for Nigeria to invest massively in a knowledge-based economy to get the country out of recession. Adeyemi stated this in Oyo town at the presentation of sewing machines and certificates to 67 participants at a month training programme on tailoring and fashion designs. The Nigerian Institute of Transport Technology, in conjunction with the lawmaker, who is also the Chairman, House Committee on Communications, organized a one month training programme for women and youths on fashion designs in the four local governments that constitute the Oyo Federal Constituency.  According to him, ‘’youth empowerment is not about spoon feeding youths or dropping some money in their pockets. The concept means making the youths meaningfully beneficial to them and to the larger society. Adeyemi who is one of the children of the Alaafin of Oyo, hinted that it was in recognition of the significance of a huge size of the youth population, which is one third of the country’s population of 160 million people as a veritable tool in development, he is making it a point of duty to adopt and make youths empowerment a cardinal agenda in his responsibility socially and economically. He donated a sum of N3million to the popular Akesan Market victims, as part of his social responsibility to the constituents. He presented certificates and sewing machines to each of the participants. Adeyemi also commissioned a solar powered borehole, which was sponsored by the MTNF.
