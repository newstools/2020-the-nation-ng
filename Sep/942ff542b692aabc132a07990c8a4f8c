Founder of online TV channel, TV360, Deji Bademosi, has donated three blocks of classrooms to his alma mater, St. Ambrose’s Catholic Secondary School, Ondo State. The new buildings were inaugurated on Friday, last week by Governor Kayode Fayemi. Bademosi, Senior Prefect of the 1994 set, said he revisited the school last year with the aim of calling the attention of the government to the sorry state of the school. He has built three new blocks comprising nine classrooms and three staff rooms in the junior secondary section of the school. In addition to the classrooms, Bademosi put up a separate building housing 10 toilets for workers and students and erected a borehole. Fayemi, during the inauguration, pledged his support to the donor and the school.  “No matter how committed a government is or no matter how dedicated we all are in our service to the state, when it comes to education, I  don’t believe that government is the best vehicle for education. Government should provide policies, it should regulate but it should work with the community and all those who are interested in rendering service in the line of education,” Fayemi said. The journalist, who also erected a perimeter fence in the school, noted that the gesture was borne out of his passion for education. “This whole project is borne out of a very strong belief that education remains the best chance to achieving one’s dream. The majority of students who attend this school come from very humble backgrounds. But they also deserve to get quality education.  I am only contributing my own quota to ensuring that the poor students who attend this school get the best of education,” he said. Commissioner for Education Femi Agagu, who represented Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, lauded Bademosi for his contributions to the promotion of public education in the state.
