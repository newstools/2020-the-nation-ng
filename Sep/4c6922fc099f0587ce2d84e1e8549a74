The Enugu Electricity Distribution (EEDC) Plc has assured its customers that the recently introduced Service Reflective Tariff hike is meant to give its customers sustained and improved service quality. EEDC said the impact of the tariff review only applies to 30 per cent of its customers who fall within Bands A, B and C, while the remaining 70 per cent, who belong to Bands D and E, are not affected by the increase. EEDC’s Head of Corporate Communications, Emeka Ezeh, stated this while addressing reporters in Enugu at the weekend. Ezeh advised the EEDC’s customers to avoid wastages and imbibe energy management culture as a smart way of reducing expenses on electricity bill. The spokesman explained that the new tariff regime is meant to improve efficiency in the sector and deliver quality service to customers. “Energy management is a sure way to go. If we keep wasting energy, we spend more and end up depriving those customers that need it the opportunity of having it,” Ezeh added.
