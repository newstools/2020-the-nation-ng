He added; “I was included at the training camp with Fremad Amager several times in February in Turkey and I was able to show myself there. I already know several of the players, and I have just met them all in Turkey. I have talked a lot with Sodiq and Sammy, and they have prepared me for life in Denmark. “Both the country and the club seem like a perfect solution to me and therefore it was an easy choice. I’m looking forward to making my debut.”
