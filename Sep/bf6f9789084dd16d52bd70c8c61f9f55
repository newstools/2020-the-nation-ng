Laycon has expressed doubt about being Head of House (HOH) ever in the show. The rising musician almost clinched the spot on Monday during the HOH challenge but lost to his former bestie- turned-enemy Erica. During his diary session on Friday, Laycon told Biggie he felt bad he won’t win the challenge despite being close. He said if he had won he wouldn’t be up for eviction and would have saved a friend from eviction as well. “This week has been going successfully except for the Head of House thing,” he started. “I’m really pained about that. To be frank, Big Brother, I feel like crying, and [I ask myself], am I really going to step into that place [HoH room] before leaving this place? “I don’t know… I don’t know. It’s painful…because if I had won, I won’t be up for eviction and another friend of mine won’t be up for eviction. There won’t be that fear of Sunday.”
