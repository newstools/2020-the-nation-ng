The Governor of Kwara State Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq has promised  to host the 1994 Super Eagles in recognition of their role in lifting the image of the country and to keep the memory of  late Rashidi Yekini  alive. The Governor made this pledge while on a visit to the Minister of Youth and Sports Development Mr Sunday Dare where they also discussed prospects in youth and sports development and areas of mutual collaboration. Governor Abdulrazaq announced that progress had been made to immortalize late Nigerian football icon Rashidi Yekini by naming the Kwara State Sports Complex Stadium, Ilorin, after him. “We will send a bill to the State House of Assembly to immortalize Rashidi Yekini with the name of the stadium changing, after the approval.” The Minister reminded the Governor of the series of letters that had been   written to the Kwara State Government to   immortalize Yekini with the naming of the stadium after the   late football legend. Governor Abdulrahman said he was a passionate follower of the US ’94 squad. “I was at the stadium in the US when Daniel Amokachi scored what seemed to be the best goal against Greece. It was quite memorable for me as an ardent lover of the game of football. After that goal, I fell in love with Jersey “Number 14” which Daniel Amokachi aka “The Bull”, wore.” The Governor said he is looking forward to hosting the USA ’94 Squad in Ilorin,  to relive  the memory of  late  Yekini who hailed from Ira Local Area of  Kwara State. The Special Assistant Sports to the President, Daniel Amokachi said he was excited that the Governor had deemed it fit to rename the Kwara State Stadium  after his late team mate, even as he was looking forward to the Governor  hosting the team.
