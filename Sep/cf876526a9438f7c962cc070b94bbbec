KORA Award nominee, Iheanacho Onuoha Acho has inked an ambassadorial deal with a realty company, Vino Estado Gardens, and Homes. Acho, who’s planning to release a new single, said that it is an honour to recognize his efforts and promises to deliver. According to the Operations Director of Dukan George Limited, Chinedu Amadi, the choice of Acho has to do with his credibility over the years in his career. “We are in the project of ensuring that every Nigerian gets access to affordable housing and we are partnering with personalities that would help get our message to Nigerians. The need for credibility for the business is sacrosanct. We want a tested and trusted personality who can create confidence for the people to patronize, then have a positive outlook all of which Acho stands for. He also has the reach, connection, and contacts.”
