 WALKING FOOTBALL, a sport started to encourage older people to stay active and fit, has caught the eye of the sport’s governing body, but for the wrong reasons. FIFA have threatened the Federation of International Walking Football Associations (FIWFA) with legal action over their logo and plans to hold a World Cup. “They sent a letter which expressed serious concerns about our logo, name of the company and the fact we were planning to run a World Cup next year,” Paul Carr, FIWFA’s chief executive told ITV News. FIFA are concerned that the logo and hosting of the major tournament could confuse people and potentially cause financial damage to the game’s ruling body.
