Former Zamfara Governor Abdulaziz Yari has declared All Progressives Congress (APC) members in the state are ready for true reconciliation of all the feuding groups. Yari’s faction has engaged Senator Kabiru Marafa- led faction in a bitter supremacy battle since 2019. Yari was at the APC National Secretariat where he led a delegation to a meeting with Chairman of the APC Caretaker Committee, Mai Mala Buni. He gave reasons for a genuine reconciliation in the state, maintaining all concerned parties must come with open mind. Yari however pointed out most of the supporters of Marafa are already serving in the government of Bello Mohammed of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). According to him: “We are ready to reconcile with everyone but the situation where you are going to reconcile with somebody who has already members in the Government of the State, he has Secretary to the State Government, he has Commissioner, and he has everyone there. “But if everyone is ready for reconciliation we will know what is there because we have been in this game since 1999 and by God’s grace we have been seeing the feature of the party come 2023.”
