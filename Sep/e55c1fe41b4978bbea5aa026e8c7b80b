 A former House of Representatives member Salisu Ningi has dumped the People’s Democratic Party, (PDP) in Bauchi State. He has joined forces with the immediate past Speaker, House of Representatives Yakubu Dogara whom he described as his political mentor. Ningi who represented Ningi /Warji Federal Constituency made this known via a letter of resignation of membership addressed to the PDP Chairman of Ningi West ward. In the letter dated September 6, Ningi said the atmosphere was no longer conducive for him and his followers to continue to be identified with “failure of the PDP.”  “You will recall that, during the 2019 General Elections, high profile politicians from my dear state, Bauchi led by my Boss/Mentor, His Excellency Rt. Hon. Yakubu Dogara decamped to PDP to oust the bad Government of M.A. Abubakar and successfully installed Sen. Bala Abdulkadir Muhammad, but along the line after watching with keen interest, I discovered that issues that made us come together to rescue our dear state have not been addressed.”
