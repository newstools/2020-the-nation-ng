Director General of National Identity Management Commission (NIMC), Aliyu Abubakar Aziz, has said that despite Nigeria’s large population, only 42 million people have been captured on the National Identity Number (NIN). Aziz spoke yesterday at the second National Identity Day celebration in Abuja. The NIMC chief advised fellow Nigerians to register as registration is free. He said in the next three to five years, Nigerians will start paying for registration of the number. Aziz advised Nigerians to focus on getting the number and not on the card, stressing that having it is important, like getting the Bank Verification Number (BVN). “It is important to mention that the government is committed to the advancement and immediate acceleration of the identification development programme of the nation. This identity goal can be fully realised when we leverage the adoption and use of digital identity to improve governance, enhance social accountability, promote security and provide basic services to the people,” he said.
