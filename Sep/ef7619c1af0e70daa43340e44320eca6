The founder of Real Act of Kindness (RAK) Development Foundation, Mr. Mobolaji Ogunlende, at the weekend launched the first recycling plant in Badagry, Lagos State, called JaniRAK. He told reporters the objective of the project was to create a cleaner environment and provide job for youths. Ogunlende said the establishment of the plant at Iworo community was done in conjunction with Green Janitor Sustainable Initiative Executive Director, Abdulsalam Ashade. He said investing in the plant was part of developing his environment and giving back to the society. Ogunlende said he started nursing the idea when Ashade invited him as a guest speaker at his clean-up programme at Sultan Beach late last year “and today it is history.” He said the plant would provide an avenue to turn waste into wealth as the case might be, which was part of United Nations’ initiative. Ashade said the journey started in 2010, but turned a new dimension in 2019 with the launching of “Pick the Plastic Project”. Ashade, the initiator of the project, said he had a vision to empower youths through waste management. Lagos State Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) Managing Director Mr. Ibrahim Odumboni hailed Ogunlende for investing in the project. He assured Badagry people that the town was in the agency’s developmental plan.
