Talisman Lionel Messi has returned to the training of Barcelona for the first time since the transfer row, which ended last Friday. Messi had informed the club he wanted to leave, claiming he was a free agent but the Catalan giants insisted his $700 million release clause must be paid for him to leave. He made a U-turn on Friday, insisting he wanted a move but wonâ€™t force a divorce with the club of his life. On Monday, he was back at the training camp of the club. To show his commitment to the club, he was the first to arrive the training pitch more than one hour before others.
