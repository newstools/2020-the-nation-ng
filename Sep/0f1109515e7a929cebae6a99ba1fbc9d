Nengi has expressed disappointment in her attitude towards Ozo at the Saturday night party. Nengi, who insists on a platonic relationship with Ozo, had told him to let her be and never talk to her again. But they started talking when Nengi left her HOH lounge later at night to meet Ozo on his bed where they sorted their differences. During a discussion on Sunday, Nengi said she’s disappointed in herself for her actions on Saturday night. “I’m so disappointed in myself for pissing you off so much. I told myself last night that after today I’m not fighting with you over anything again,” Nengi said. She however clarified why she was upset, stating: “I’m not fighting you over the things you do or because you got angry that I ate your meat, that’s not the reason, the reason is that I just feel like the energy is different”.
