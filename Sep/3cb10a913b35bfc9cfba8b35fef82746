A total of fifty unemployed graduates have been recruited for temporary jobs under the internship programme of the National Directorate of Employment, (NDE) in Anambra state. The beneficiaries posted to various corporate organisations in the state were expected to serve for an initial period of three months. Addressing the beneficiaries on Wednesday at the state headquarters, Amawbia, Coordinator of NDE, Mrs Chika Ufele, announced a monthly stipend of N15, 000 for each of them. She said the programme was targeted at addressing the alarming level of unemployment through the provision of transient jobs to the teeming youths. She added that the beneficiaries could likely secure permanent jobs at their places of primary assignment or become self-employed after the programme. She said, “The programme is part of the 2020 Graduate Attachment Programme (GAP) being done across the 36 states of the federation and FCT. A total of 1,850 jobs would be created nationwide. “The Special Public Works Department of the NDE which seeks to identify and exploit employment opportunities that abound in the public is playing a leading role in the programme. “The department through GAP promotes mass employment strategies through the attachment of qualified graduates to willing employers of labour on tutelage for 3-6 months.” Appreciating the Director-General of NDE, Dr Nasiru Mohammed for graciously approving the implementation of the programmes and facilitating its take off, Ufele urged the beneficiaries to put in their best for maximum results. One of the beneficiaries, Victoria Nwogbo, thanked NDE for availing her the opportunity to be productive in life, pledging commitment during the programme.
