Apart from the fact that those who recovered from Coronavirus illness outnumbered new infections last week, Nigeria recorded fewer deaths than in previous weeks, writes Associate Editor ADEKUNLE YUSUF For the umpteenth time, the Federal Government has advised Nigerians not to pay for Covid-19 test anywhere in the country, stressing that the test is free nationwide. The National Coordinator, Presidential Task Force on Covid-19, Dr. Sani Aliyu, reiterated that testing remains free for citizens across the country because Federal Government provides free test kits across the laboratories and that state governments pay private laboratories for every test they do. He, however, clarified that private laboratories can charge for their services if clients want to undergo Covid-19 test for the purposes of international travels. The cost of Covid-19 PCR test varies across private laboratories, ranging between N42,750 and N50,400 – depending on where the test is done. According to him, the best way the country can rid itself of the harmful virus is by sustaining testing activities through provision of free access to testing. He stressed that charging for a test even by private laboratories is not allowed. Whether what is happening in the large network of laboratory facilities across the country is contrary to the directive of government or not, Covid-19 testing is taking place every day in the country. For example, on Saturday, September 26, a total of 7,968 samples across the country were tested in Nigeria, according to NCDC. Last week (from Sunday September 20 to Saturday September 26), recoveries stood at 1,288, while 1,053 new cases and 12 deaths were recorded in the country – the fewest weekly fatalities in recent times. To date, 58,198 cases have been confirmed in Nigeria; 49,722 patients have recovered and discharged and 1,106 deaths recorded in 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).
