 MANY former members of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Social Democratic Party (SDP) and Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN) have defected to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ondo State. The defectors joined the PDP at Iju/Itaogbolu, Akure North Local Government during the inauguration of Akure North Inter-party Campaign Committee. They were received by the PDP governorship candidate, Mr. Eyitayo Jegede. A former candidate for the House of Assembly under the ACPN, Mr. Busuyi Alademehin, said they joined the PDP and mobilised their supporters to vote for the party because of Jegede’s personality. He said Jegede had always been in touch with the common man and they believed that he (Jegede) would alleviate their sufferings Alademehin said: “No doubt, we had got tempting offers from the ruling APC begging us to join them, but we turned them down.  “We are better informed and are not ready to mortgage our future; not after these three and a half years of neglect by those at the helm.” A former state Chairman of Ondo PDP, Chief Ebenezer Alabi, denied rumours that he joined Deputy Governor Agboola Ajayi to defect to the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP). “People should stop bearing tales about me without clarifying from me. “I remain a loyal PDP member. The fact that I worked for another candidate before the primary election doesn’t mean I must leave my party once my candidate cannot win. “So, I am wholly for our governorship candidate, Eyitayo Jegede. There is no going back,” Alabi said. Jegede said the PDP would serve people if elected back to power. He promised to give children quality and affordable education, provide free health services for expectant mothers, nursing mothers and the elderly; and grant financial aid to petty traders and artisans, among others. Jegede warned those plotting to invade Ondo with mercenaries from other states to rig the October 10 election, “to stop at the state’s borders, as the people are determined to defend their right.”
