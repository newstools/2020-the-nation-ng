Alvaro Morata is set to join Juve on loan from Atletico Madrid in a deal that will cost €9million and the Italian club will also apparently have an option to buy the 27-year-old for €45m. Juventus, who have been searching for a forward, welcomed Morata back as he landed in Turin. “@AlvaroMorata” >@AlvaroMorata is back in town!” the club wrote on Twitter alongside a picture of the forward. Morata is set for his second spell at Juve, where he scored 27 goals in 93 games across two seasons between 2014 and 2016. He then returned to Real Madrid for a season before joining Chelsea and later Atletico, where he netted 12 LaLiga goals in 34 games last season. With Gonzalo Higuain having left to join Inter Miami, Juve had been linked with the likes of Barcelona’s Luis Suarez and Roma’s Edin Dzeko. Morata’s move could pave the way for Suarez, 33, to join Atletico. Juve have won nine consecutive Serie A titles and opened their campaign under Andrea Pirlo with a 3-0 win over Sampdoria on Sunday.
