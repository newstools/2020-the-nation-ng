The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Edo State chapter, has hailed President Muhammadu Buhari for deploying security in the state ahead of Saturday’s governorship election. The party, through its Publicity Secretary, Chris Nehikhare, while speaking with reporters in Benin, said with the massive deployment of security personnel, the poll would be crisis free. It said: “The efforts put in place by the Buhari-led government to ensure security and safety of Edo people, before, during and after the election, deserve commendation. “With the massive deployment of personnel of the Nigeria Police Force (NPF), the military, Department of State Services (DSS), Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) and other security agencies in Edo State to supervise Saturday’s election, we are confident that the poll will be crisis-free. “President Buhari’s commitment to the safety and security of voters will bolster confidence among voters and impact positively on voters’ turnout.”
