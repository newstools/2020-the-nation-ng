Prince has tipped Nengi and Laycon as possible winners of the show. Prince picked two of his former Housemates, who he says he would love to see win the prize. Prince selected the two Housemates in a recent interview with African Magic. He said: “They are two people that I want to win. If they win, I’ll be very happy because I love them both, Dora I always say that I love Dora and I remember saying if I wanted to lose to someone I would lose to her. “Another person is Laycon, for some reason I just love Laycon from the first day who I think might win Nengi or Laycon”said Prince.”
