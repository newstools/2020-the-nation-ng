 THE National Association of Seadogs (Pyrates Confraternity) has claimed that the COVID-19 crisis has shown the unpreparedness of infrastructure, education systems, programmes and people to ensure the continuity of teaching and learning in such a situation. Its Capoon, Abiola Owoaje, spoke this in a statement entitled, ‘Literacy and Reading for International Literacy Day’. The Seadogs, however, said the development was not only due to the pandemic crisis, but an endemic and progressive challenge of successive administrations. The association said not even the plans drawn up to implement the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have successfully and effectively delivered the SDGs to low literate persons unless action is taken. The NAS said the government had acknowledged in its National Policy on Education that education in Nigeria is an instrument “par excellence” for effecting national development.
