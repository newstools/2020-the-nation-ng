All Progressives Congress (APC) youth leaders at Ewu, Esan Central Local Government Area of Edo State, have alleged that they narrowly escaped death, as they were attacked by thugs hired by Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftains while they were pasting posters of the APC governorship candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu. The APC youth said they were preparing for the partyâ€™s ward-to-ward rally when the incident occurred. The leader of Ewu Youth APC Campaign Council and former special adviser to the council chairman, Clement Inegben, said about 8pm last Friday, he was summoned to appear at Ewu Police Station, only to be attacked as he got to the station.  Another youth, simply identified as Aguni, said they were installing mini billboards when PDP thugs attacked them with weapons. Reacting to the development, Pastor Ize-Iyamu enjoined the youth to keep the peace. He, however, lamented that after the Oba of Benin, Oba Ewuare II, had advised leaders of the APC and PDP to be peaceful, the latter was still violent. Other APC leaders at Ewu, including a former speaker of the House of Assembly, David Iyoha and an ex-commissioner, Larry Aghedo, enjoined the youth to keep the peace.
