A non-governmental organisation, the Youth Initiative for Advocacy, Growth and Advancement (YIAGA) Africa has identified potential hotspots and flashpoints of violence ahead of Saturday’s governorship election in Edo State. Speaking at a press briefing on Thursday, the Chairman of YIAGA Africa’s Edo 2020 Election Observation Mission, Dr. Aisha Abdullahi said based on the report of the group’s observation carried out ahead of the poll, two-thirds of the local governments in the state are potential flashpoints of violence. These, she said include Etsako West, Etsako East, Etsako Central, Owan West, and Akoko Edo, all in Edo North Senatorial District. Others are Oredo, Orhiomwon, Egor, Ovia Northeast, and Ikpoba/Okha in Edo South, as well as Esan Central, Esan Northeast and Esan West in Edo Central. Dr. Abdullahi said YIAGA Africa’s study suggests that the spare of violence and insecurity in the pre-election period may discourage voters from turning up on Election Day. She said the state is witnessing a surge in cult groups’ activities, especially in Ikpoba/Okha, Etsako Central, Owan West, Esan West and Ovia Northeast local governments. She added: “This is mainly attributable to an entrenched subculture of violence built around well-known strongmen, thugs, touts, gangsters, and cultists on the one hand, and widespread belief that elections cannot be won or smooth governance guaranteed without strong-arm tactics and the support of potential thugs. “The situation is direr because of the proliferation of small arms and other weapons, which is evident in the free use of firearms at campaign venues.” The group’s report also condemned physical violence towards women in Etsako Central, vandalism or destruction of property belonging to a candidate or his/her supporters in Oredo, Orhiomwon, Igueben, Etsako Central, Esan Northeast, Ikpoba/Okha, Egor, and Esan Southeast local governments.
