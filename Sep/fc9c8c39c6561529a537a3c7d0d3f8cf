Vee has revealed why Trickytee would make it to the final despite being up for possible eviction more often than any other Housemate. Vee, during her diary session on Wednesday, said surviving eviction more than three times shows how strong Trickytee is. “I think Trikytee would be in the final; he has no alliances and he is still here. “He’s only had immunity once and has been up more than three times yet survived. This makes him a strong contender.” Meanwhile, Vee, Neo, and Nengi have secured a spot as finalists. Housemates up for possible eviction are Ozo, Dorathy, Trikytee, and Laycon.
