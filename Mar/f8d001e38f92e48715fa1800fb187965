 About 400 small and medium scale business entrepreneurs in Onitsha, Anambra State, have benefitted from the Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) capacity training organised by the United Bank of Africa (UBA). The beneficiaries were trained in records keeping, cost reduction, stock compiling, financial and taxation planning, maximising opportunities, financial planning and projections. UBA’s Regional Head of Anambra II Anyanuno Ozioma said the capacity development workshop was to add value to their customers’ businesses through improving their knowledge and skills. It was also to fill the existing gaps observed in business and allay beneficiaries’ hitherto fears of expanding their businesses. He said: “Modern day business requires that an average businessman regularly updates his knowledge to cope with the changing economy. Besides, this is an internet age and our customers need to learn new ways of doing business and how to package their businesses for increased patronage.” Anyanuno said the turnout was a demonstration of the bank’s acceptance by the traders and the importance they attached to the workshop. He promised a repeat of the exercise to accommodate more people. Head of E-banking Babatunde Ajayi said the programme was part of the bank’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in furtherance of its responsiveness to customers’ needs.
