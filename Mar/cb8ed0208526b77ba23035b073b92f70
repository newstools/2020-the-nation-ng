 MANDILAS Group, the sole franchise dealer of Carrier Air-Conditioners in Nigeria, has donated 32 air conditioners in support of GTBank/Lagos State Isolation Centre at the Onikan Stadium, Lagos. It said it was installing 32 Carrier Ceiling Concealed Ducted air-conditioning units at the isolation centre. Group Chief Executive Officer Ola Debayo-Doherty praised the government’s efforts in combating spread of the Coronavirus. “We are very proud to partner with Lagos State and GTBank in setting up a fit for purpose isolation and treatment centre at Mobolaji Johnson Arena,” she said. According to her, the units were humidity and temperature-controlled, with high filtration levels for clean indoor air quality, to prevent stale air in the room. “This will encourage habitation and make individuals at the isolation centre more comfortable,” she added.
