The postponement of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games would not affect the staging of the remaining qualification tournament. These were the views of the Secretary General, Nigeria Olympic Committee (NOC), Olabanji Oladapo, who described the shift in the Olympic Games as a good development for athletes who are yet to pick their slots at the games. “I think the decision to postpone the games is a good development as the whole world is still grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic; especially for those qualifiers that are yet to take place, the postponement will help the athletes to prepare well and help the host of such qualifiers to put up a good show,” the experienced Oladapo said. “I am sure that the decision to change the venue of the qualifiers remains with the International Sports Federation who will make the final decision before the games hold next summer.” The member of the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) Board of Directors (BOD) however, described the decision by Canada and Australia to pull out of the games as not political, adding that they are only pushing for the shift in the games which has been made by IOC and OC of Olympic and Paralympic Games.
