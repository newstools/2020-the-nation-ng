 Roads and streets around Wuse 2 area of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Abuja, were on Tuesday mostly empty as residents and businesses observed Day 1 of federal governmentâ€™s restriction order. Vehicular and other normal human movements and activities around the places visited by The Nation were lonely as virtually all shops and business outlets remained closed. The Nation observed that the ever-busy Ademola Adetokunbo Crescent and many of the adjoining streets off the main road were unusually quiet and deserted. Although a few essential commodities and drugs retail stores were opened to business, only a few persons were seen going in for patronage, much unlike the experience on Monday. Hundreds of residents had on Monday thronged retail stores like H-Medix, Paygreens and 4U stores along Adetokunbo Ademola Crescent, all having long queues of buyers outside their entrances. Other streets off Adetokunbo Ademola Crescent, like Lobito Street, Blantyre Street and Durban Street were all empty on Tuesday afternoon. Pictures:
