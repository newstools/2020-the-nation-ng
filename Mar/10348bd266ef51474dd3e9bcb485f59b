Grammy-winning musician, Wyclef Jean recently said late Afrobeat legend, Fela Anikulapo-Kuti planted a seed by creating the genre of music known as Afrobeat. Wyclef made this known during the first leg of the ‘Midem African Tour 2020’ which took place recently at the Freeme Space, Nike Art Gallery Road, Lekki, Lagos. In a live 52-minute Skype question and answer session posted at him, Wyclef said Fela Kuti had planted a seed by creating the Afrobeat genre and that African artists need to take advantage of it. He said, “Fela Kuti has planted a seed and now that the flower has grown, nobody needs to change it. All you have to do is reinvent and recreate the Afrobeat sound.” Continuing, Wyclef said, “Artists need to prove their worth through unique sounds. They need to sell themselves because nobody will. African artists are the most viewed artists on YouTube, that should send a message to upcoming African artists. However, you have to acknowledge the preceding generation and not talk down on what they have done and their achievements. Both the old and new generations of musicians need to respect and give credence to their skill; the old generation respecting the new and vice versa.” The ‘Midem African Tour 2020’, which is now in its third year, was hosted by OAP Sensei Uche and attended by music industry stakeholders, tech professionals, entertainment lawyers, talent managers and other members of the entertainment industry that include Efe Omorogbe, Seyi Shay, TY Mix, DJ Cuppy, Nosa Dag, Steve Osagie, Joey Akan, Prince Eghosa, Sijuade Adedokun, Martha Huro, Benjamin Omesiete, Maduforo Chidinma, Matthew Oyebanji, Shakar El and Energy.
