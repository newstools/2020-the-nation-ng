 A Police Inspector, Tuddy Warebayigha, has been arrested for shooting his wife dead following lingering dispute on custody of some of their nine children. The inspector, serving at Kaima Police Division in Kolokuma/Opokuma Local Government Area of Bayelsa State, reportedly shot his wife, Charity, at close range on her legs and stomach. The deceased, who was a teacher reportedly died on the spot following the shooting that threw the entire Sampou community into mourning. Sources said the killer cop was known for his erratic behaviour and heavy alcohol consumption lifestyle. One of the sources, who spoke in confidence said: “Sampou indigenes that witnessed the incident, said though the couple were no longer together as husband and wife, the Police inspector usually threatened to deal with the wife. As she was on her way home from the farm, her armed and tipsy husband accosted her and demanded for the whereabouts of the children. “The deceased did not react to all the abuses by her husband. Her police husband cocked his rifle and shot her in the leg. Other sympathizers attempted to grip him from behind and possibly disarm him but failed. He threatened to kill anyone who intervened.” “After he shot her in the stomach, he was seen making phone call to an unknown person boasting that he had shot her and taught her a lesson”. When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer, Butswat Asinim, confirmed the incident. He said: “On 24/02/2020 at about 1350 hours, Inspector Tuddy Warebayigha, serving at Kaima Police Division, Bayelsa State shot his wife, Mrs Charity Francis Tuddy on her way to the farm at Sampou, Kolokuma/ Opukuma Local Government Area, over marital misunderstanding”. “The victim was immediately rushed to the hospital, where she was confirmed dead. The suspect was arrested and detained at the State Criminal Investigation Department for further Investigation. He has been defaulted and if found culpable, will be dismissed and charge to court.”
