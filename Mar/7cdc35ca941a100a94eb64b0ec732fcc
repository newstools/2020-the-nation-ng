A pastor (names withheld) of a Celestial Church at Ijapo Estate, Akure in Ondo State was on Friday stopped from further conduct of naming ceremony by the State Task Force on COVID-19. The Task Force led by Senior Special Assistant to Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu on Special Duties, Dr. Doyin Odebowale, was monitoring compliance with the Governor’s directives banning large gathering and closure of shops selling non-essential commodities. The Pastor ran away on sighting the team but the people present were advised to go home. Odewale said the Task Force was not out to make any arrest but to ensure strict compliance. He said, “We are not on total lockdown in Ondo. We don’t want to shut down the state because we don’t want people to panic. “It is to protect people from coronavirus and as such we don’t want congregation of people. “We are also going round mosques to ensure total compliance. The purpose is not to lock up anybody.”
