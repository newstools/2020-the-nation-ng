Members of the Academic Union of Universities (ASUU) on Friday reaffirmed its stand in the full implementation of the 2009 Federal Government/ASUU agreement, even as it insisted that it would join Integrated Payroll and Personnel information System (IPPIS). The Zonal Chairman of the ASUU, Kano zone, Professor Mahmoud M. Lawan, who spoke at BUK Secretariat, Kano, said that the ASUU would continue to remain resolute on the issue of IPPS, warning that any attempt by the government to dictate what happens in the university system erodes the autonomy of our universities by making them incapable of delivering on their mandate of teaching, research and community service. According to him, the union will make it categorically clear that its members will continue to resist the violation of the Universities Miscellaneous Amendment Act through the IPPIS. Also, the Kano ASUU zone dismissed the claim of the Federal Government that 55 per cent of its members were enrolled into the IPPIS. In addition, the Chairman challenged the Federal Government to provide the accurate statistics of those who enrolled into the IPPIS, stressing that it was false, pointing out that over 80 from the university strata were yet to enroll.
