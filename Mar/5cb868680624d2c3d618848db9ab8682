 The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) Lagos Zonal Office Friday said it had taken a Lagos-based lawyer into custody, following allegations that she scammed a fraud suspect of N5 million. It said it was investigating a lead that the lawyer obtained the money by claiming she would secure the suspect’s freedom after bribing an EFCC official. In a statement, the Commission said the lawyer would be arraigned “as soon as investigation is concluded.” The lawyer “was arrested on Tuesday 17th March, 2020, after one Henry George Umoh, a relative of a suspect, Kelechi Uka, in EFCC custody, alleged that the lawyer collected the sum of four million naira from him purportedly to bribe the operative of the Commission. “During interrogation, she confessed that she actually lied to the relative of the suspect that she could get whatever she wants on the matter with a view to bribe the operatives of the Commission to compromise the case,” the statement said. It said Kelechi and two others involved the substantive matter had been served with their charges and would be arraigned soon.
