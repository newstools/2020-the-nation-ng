Our Reporter  African Voices Change Makers, a 30-minute magazine programme sponsored by national telecommunication company, Globacom, will this week feature two female professionals in bike riding. The first guest, Grace Mwari, a Kenyan, is an off-road motorcycle tour guide. South African-born Kirsten Landman, an endurance rider and professional off-road rider, is the second guest. They will both delight viewers with the story of their sojourn in the bikers’ world. Mwari, has been riding for five years and is currently the only female enduro racer in Kenya. She has since ridden in South East Asia, Southern Africa, East Africa, Morocco and parts of Europe. An off-road motorcycle tour guide at Offroad Adventure East Africa, she takes riders for safaris in little known places to experience wildlife, culture and the most spectacular scenery. Speaking on her foray to the riding profession, Mwari who explained that she was encouraged by her friend said, “Around that same time, I had housemates who were riders and they thought I was capable of doing it. I was living and working in India and when they invited me on a trip to the Himalayas, I did not think twice about it. I got hooked after that trip and have been riding ever since.” Landman, on the other hand, became a professional at the age of 22 and has since grown to become a force to be reckoned with in the enduro racing world. She has successfully competed in major international events, including Redbull Romaniacs, Redbull Sea to Sky, Redbull Megawatt 111, Redbull Braveman and the Roof of Africa. She has the honour of being the first female to finish the aforementioned races.  Landman has distinguished herself as a top biker on the continent.
