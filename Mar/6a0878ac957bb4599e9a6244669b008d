From Rasaq Ibrahim, Ado-Ekiti  Many people were reportedly injured yesterday in Ado-Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital, as the loyalists of former governor Ayodele Fayose and Senator Biodun Olujimi clashed over conduct of ward congress. The Nation gathered that the incident occurred around 4pm at the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) secretariat at Ajilosun, Ado-Ekiti when the supporters of Fayose and Olujimi were waiting for the members of the appeal panel sent to adjudicate in matters arising from the conduct of last Saturday’s congress arrived in the state. It was learnt that weapons such as bottles, cutlasses and stones were used when members of the panel sent by Chief Uche Secondus-led National Working Committee (NWC) arrived, which prompted the Nigeria Police to draft men to the place.  A source said that many people were attacked with machetes, cutlasses and stones and they sustained injuries, including two die-hard supporters of Senator Olujimi, Abanishile Femi and Rotimi Sunday. The duo were reportedly rushed to an undisclosed private hospital. When our reporter visited the secretariat, over 30 policemen were at the entrance of the one storey building, which was shut. Over eight police vans deployed from Okesa and Ologede police stations were stationed at strategic locations. Responding to the attack, Olujimi blamed Fayose and his supporters for allegedly trying to define the PDP with the emblem of violence by mobilising thugs to where the panel was expected to sit. But Fayose, through his media aide, Lere Olayinka, blamed Olujimi for the attack.
