 In recent times, Davido’s quiet father, Adedeji Adeleke, has been making headlines. Last month, he held a massive wedding for his first son, Adewale, in Dubai. During the week too, he reportedly acquired another private jet. In spite of his affluence, however, he still remains one of the few billionaires whose humility is second to none. He was one of the personalities who graced the 60th Founders’ Day Anniversary of Adventist Grammar School, Ede, Osun State. Social Circuit also learnt he is an old student of the school. When Adeleke spotted Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, he rushed to him to pay homage. He bowed before the respected traditional ruler and the Ooni received him warmly. He also cleared the way for him.
