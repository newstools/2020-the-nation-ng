 IN its fight against COVID-19, Lagos State Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) has distributed 10,000 protective tools to workers. The items were presented to President, Association of Waste Managers in Nigeria David Oluwasegun Oriyomi. Speaking, LAWMA’s Managing Director Muyiwa Gbadegesin said the essence was to ensure every worker responsible for evacuation of waste were protected from COVID-19. “During this period, we will continue to work day and night and because of the virus we want to make sure that the over 20,000 people working in the waste management sector are properly protected.” He said ‘’…we have enough for 10,000 people and we are going to keep supplying until everyone is covered. “This protects them from infections by the virus because they are in close contact with waste and you just have to assume that the waste may be contaminated that’s why we want their face, eyes, nose and mouth to be covered and when they finish the day’s work, they have soap to wash their hands. “We are distributing nose masks, gloves, soaps, hand sanitisers and we will also be sanitising the bin locations state-wide,” he added. Oriyomi said ‘’the equipment come in handy as they were protective equipment. “The workers are the ones that have first touch with the waste so we must safeguard them so that they can deliver their services …”
