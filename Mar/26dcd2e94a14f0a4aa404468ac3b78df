 A LAGOS High Court sitting in Igbosere on Thursday convicted and sentenced a couple, Mr. Ignatius Onuorah and his wife, Peace, to a total of 13 years and six months in prison for buying stolen phones worth N50 million. The trial judge, Justice Lateef Lawal-Akapo, also convicted and sentenced a sales clerk, Ada Okoro, who stole the phones from her boss’ stores. Justice Lawal-Akapo, in addition, ordered that the couple’s company, Becco Systems Limited, which warehoused the stolen phones be wound up and forfeited to Lagos State government. The judge handed down the verdict, while delivering judgment in a five count-criminal charge of conspiracy, stealing, possession of stolen goods and obtaining money under false pretence, brought against them by the Lagos State Director of Public Prosecution (DPP). The couple, and the sales clerk, were arraigned before the court on an amended five-count charge marked ID/27/2011 on the charge sheet.
