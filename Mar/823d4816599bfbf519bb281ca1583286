Amidst controversies stirred by the appointment of Elisha Abbo, Senator representing Adamawa north, as patron of the Actors Guild Of Nigeria (AGN), the body has also announced billionaire Ned Nwoko as Chairman, National Patrons Board. Recall that actresses such as Hilda Dokubo and Kate Henshaw faulted the rationale behind Abbo’s appointment, describing the legislator as an “abuser of women” due to an alleged assault on a lady last year. While announcing the news, AGN president, Emeka Rollas, described Nwoko as a man with a lion heart. He said: “Rt. Hon. Prince Ned Nwoko is a man with a lion heart, husband to our own Princess Regina Daniels Nwoko. It was my pleasure decorating you with all the instruments of your appointment as Chairman, Board of National Patrons of Actors Guild of Nigeria (AGN). You have promised to join hands with other patrons to massively support the AGN projects.”
