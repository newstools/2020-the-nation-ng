 Renowned criminologist and General Overseer of Royal House of Faith, Pastor Bassey James, has declared community policing is the ultimate solution to the prevailing insecurity in the nation. According to him, Nigeria needs a model of community policing where community leaders, Divisional Police Officers and Chairmen of each local government will be in charge of locally recruited and trained vigilantes who would in turn be responsible for securing their local communities. “So there is need for the government to work with us. Let everybody contribute to the security development of Nigeria, bring in relevant criminologists and retired military people should play a role,” he stated. James, also the Chairman of Bascon Nigeria Ltd, a security and telecommunication consultant expert, spoke ahead of a proposed conference on launch of Niger Delta Integrated Community Policing Centres.  He explained that the project is aimed at complementing the federal government’s effort in securing the region and build partnership with youths on the needs to shun violence, thuggery, kidnapping and all forms of social vices. He commended the Inspector General of the Police, Muhammed Adamu, for his favorable disposition to community policing. James however pointed out that government cannot do it alone, pointing out the business of securing the lives and property cannot be left alone to government anywhere in the world. The conference, he added, is also targeted at bringing the youths across the region to understand that violence does no one any good. He said they will also be trained to embrace efforts to secure their communities and government properties within through effective liaison with locals and police authorities. Niger Delta Integrated Community Policing Centres is the brain child of James, who worked for years with Akwa-Ibom State and the Police in the Delta region.
