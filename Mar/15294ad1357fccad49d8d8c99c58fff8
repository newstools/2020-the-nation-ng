 THE former Dean, Faculty of Science, Augustine University, Ilara-Epe, Lagos State, Prof. Michael Soladoye, has urged students of the institution, especially the new intakes for the 2019/2020 academic session, not to allow their love for entertainment to ruin their studies. Prof. Soladoye, who spoke when delivering a paper titled: “Matriculation for an enduring academic success”, during the university’s fifth matriculation, advised the students to be serious. The don said: “The virtues of technology are evident, but matriculating students should be aware of the enticing charisma and pervasive nature of the Internet and social media. Steadfast willpower is essential to overcome the alluring addiction of time wasters. “All work and no play make us dull, but all play and no work result in squandering precious possibilities. Tiwa Savage, Davido, Whiz Kid, Teni, Simi, Adekunle Gold, Olamide, Naira Marley, Kiss Daniel to mention but a few, all contribute to the entertainment sector. However, their music and videos are consequences of the judicious use of their time. Do not advance their careers to the detriment of yours. Restrict your surfing, sharing, retweeting, liking and posting. Time is finite. Manage your allotment wisely.” The Vice Chancellor, Prof. Steve Afolami, reiterated the commitment of the institution towards inculcating good character in the students. He said one of the missions of the institution is to teach good characters and attitude, adding that these will show the background and institution attended by the person. Sixty-four students matriculated in seven courses and from two faculties. The courses are: Accounting and Finance, Business Administration, Economics, English, Biological Sciences, Chemical Sciences and Mathematical Sciences from the Faculty of Humanities, Management and Social Sciences, and Faculty of Sciences.
