 The Edo State Government has assured support for families of deceased civil servants who until their deaths were staff of the state’s Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources. The Commissioner for Agriculture and Natural Resources, Hon. Richard Edebiri, gave the assurance to the families while presenting donations to them. He said Governor Godwin Obaseki approved the donations to four families of the staff of the Ministry who died in active service. Edebiri noted, “We beg of you all to accept all of these in good fate. We have a responsible and responsive government. When we brought the unfortunate incident to the governor’s notice, he thought it proper that we give these benefits to the families.  It is not like it will take care of all their expenses but we just did it for them to know that we share in their moments of grief.” He added that deceased civil servants are entitled to all their death benefits which will be paid at the appropriate time. Mr. Friday Osemwengie, who spoke on behalf of the families, expressed appreciation to the governor for remembering and honouring them. He said the cash donations will go a long way to assist the families in organising the funeral rites for the deceased civil servants.
