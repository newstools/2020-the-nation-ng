 The leadership of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) said on Thursday that the federal government was implementing the Integrated Personnel Payroll Information System (IPPIS) with a loan of about $140 billion dollars. National President of the Union, Prof. Biodun Ogumyemi who discussed this at a meeting with the leadership of the House of Representatives said the union was opposed to the IPPIS because it will limit universities and reduce them to mere local universities which cannot attract foreign scholars. He said since 2013 when the the platform was first introduced to members of the union, they made their position clear to government on why the policy cannot work and agreeing with the government to set up a joint committee to come out with a workable platform.. According to him, since the joint committee was set up, the union did not hear from the government until July 2019 when the government came up with threats because they had made up their mind in what to do. He said the union has challenged the government to tell them any country in the world where the IPPIS is used in the university system, saying “it is just about us. They have said that our opposition to IPPIS meant we are encouraging corruption. But we are the ones that always told them that they are reneging on their responsibility.”
