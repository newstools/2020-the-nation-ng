 ARMSTRONG Arinze, better known as Rhatti is a Nigerian born Singer, rapper and songwriter who hails from Enugu-Ukwu in Anambra State, Nigeria. He rose to limelight after his songs and short videos went viral on the internet; and ever since then, he hasn’t looked back. On his debut single, Biko produced by Dera, multi-talented Rhatti exhibits his mastery of the art, lyrical depth, amazing punch lines, a mix of afro rhythm, rap, trap and many others vibes he’s been blessed with. The lyrics were a fusion of phonetics and sweet Igbo. His sensational rap quickly gets the girls in a whole mood. Rhatti delivered a potential baby making song and shows he’s a pro when it comes to the affairs of the other room in this buzzing jam which is rocking the airwaves and fast becoming the favourites of many on their playlists. His dexterity earned him an appearance on Olamide’s latest album, 999 where he effortlessly delivered a dope hook on the track, Warlords which also featured another hiphop heavyweight, Phyno alongside Cheque and Snow. The music video for Biko was directed by Clarence Peters. Rhatti is most definitely one amazing act to watch out for this year and on the charts too.
