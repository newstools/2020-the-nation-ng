In a bid to help curb the spread of COVID-19 epidemic, Youths and Sports Minister Sunday Dare has donated sanitizer, handwashers and other sanitary materials to staff of the Ministry and adjourning communities in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Dare said the gesture is to help against the spread of the virus by ensuring that people adhere to hygienic instructions which would help contain the spread of the virus. “We have a responsibility to help fight against the spread of COVID-19 by maintaining simple hygiene of hand washing, sanitizing our hands and maintaining social distance. We must be our brothers’ keepers at a time like this. We must lend support to those that are infected and prevent further spread through consistent enlightenment and education. “We cannot take anything for granted. All hands must be on deck to fight this scourge. The Federal government through the Ministry of Health and other agencies are doing everything possible to manage the spread of the virus. We have a responsibility to lend support to these efforts.” Dare had ordered the closure of all the National stadia in Lagos, Abuja, Kaduna and Ibadan as well as the suspension of all sporting  activities to mitigate the spread of the virus. The Federal government had called off the National Sports Festival (NSF) as a result of the epidemic. The weekly Federal Executive Council meeting has been suspended, while workers from level 12 and bellow were directed to work from home.  Only on Tuesday, the International Olympic committee postponed the 2020 Tokyo Olympics till next year as a result of the spread of the virus.
