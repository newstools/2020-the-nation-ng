 IN line with President Muhamnadu Buhari’s order on restriction of movement in Lagos, Ogun and Abuja on Sunday night, Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has confirmed restriction of movement in the state for 14 days. The governor, in a statement yesterday, signed by Commissioner for Information, Strategy and Security, Gbenga Omotoso, said the restriction came into effect from 11 pm, yesterday, for 14 days. He noted that only people rendering essential services, such as health workers, manufacturers and distributors of health equipment and drugs, food and water companies were expected to go out. “Also allowed to move are workers in telecommunications, petroleum distribution and retailing as well as power companies and the media, among others whose jobs cannot be handled at home”, he added. While acknowledging that the restriction was a tough decision, the governor said it was necessary in the battle  against the COVID-19 pandemic. “We must cooperate with the authorities as long as this restriction lasts”, Sanwo-Olu said. He maintained that the restriction would give room for medical workers to deal faster with cases; contain the disease as those infected would be easily identified and isolated; enhance social-distancing, to prevent more people from contracting the disease. Sanwo-Olu hailed Lagosians for their endurance since measures to fight Coronavirus were announced.
