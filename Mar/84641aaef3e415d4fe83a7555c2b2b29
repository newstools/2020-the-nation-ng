Standing by passengers is no longer allowed by the Lagos Bus Services Limited (LBSL) in its buses under new rules rolled out on Saturday to combat the spread of the coronavirus. The Managing Director of the company, Mr. Idowu Oguntona, said this in a statement that the decision was in line with the State Government’s directive to limit the number of persons in any crowd to a maximum of 50 across the state. “As efforts are being made globally to contain the spread of COVID-19, LBSL in conformity with State Government’s directives to avoid gathering of more than 50 people will henceforth restrict passengers from standing in all its buses,” he said in the statement by LBSL’s spokesman, Afolabi Olawale. “Prior to the index case of COVID-19 in the state and the subsequent directive from the state government, the company has always maintained high hygiene practices in all its buses. “In view of the current reality of the COVID-19 outbreak, the company has started taking some more stringent decisions as part of efforts to contain and limit the spread of the virus. “Based on our usual operating standards, we would pay more attention to the cleaning of our buses. “As we speak, we have enhanced our cleaning regime to ensure that all surfaces within our buses are properly disinfected, including the handrails, hand poles, seats, drivers’ cabin and dashboards.”
