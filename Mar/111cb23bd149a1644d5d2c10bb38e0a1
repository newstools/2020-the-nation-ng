 A CAMPUSLIFE correspondent in Minna, Mr. Abdulsalam Mahmud, will  attend this year’s ‘Next Einstein Forum (NEF) Global Gathering” in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya. The science-oriented event will attract distinguished scientists, award-winning researchers and prolific science journalists, across the world. It will take place at the Kenyatta International Conference Centre, between Tuesday and Friday  next week. Kenya’s President, Uhuru Kenyatta, is expected to declare the event open. The goal of the gathering is to bring together stakeholders in science and innovation, business and policy in Africa to review trends and create concrete roadmaps on key questions. The NEF Global Gathering 2020 programme will have sessions that will unpack the underlying theme ‘Connecting science to humanity’ with four sub-themes: ‘Connectivity, ubiquity and mobility’; ‘Climate, energy, food and growth’; Precision health’; and ‘Building a nation’s scientific capacity’.  There will also be an ‘Innovation Salon’ which will feature panels and fireside chats on how to move from lab to market, innovation competitions and investor speed dating. Mahmud, who is a regular contributor to CAMPUSLIFE in Niger State, will join 19 other African journalists to participate in a ‘Science journalism training and script writing workshop’ which forms a segment of the event. The workshop will explore the challenges facing science reporting in Africa, while also affording delegates techniques for delivering engaging and impactful science stories to the media. Mahmud, who is a Fellow of both Africa Arts Media Earth Initiative (AAMEI) and African Science Literacy Network (ASLN), is a distinction graduate of Mass Communication from the Fati Lami Abubakar Institute of Legal and Administrative Studies (FLAILAS), in Niger State.
