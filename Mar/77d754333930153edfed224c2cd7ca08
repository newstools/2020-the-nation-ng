Dupe Ayinla-olasunkanmi  CHRISTIAN actor and University lecturer, Doyin Hassan, has apologised to fans over his role as Iguana in a Mount Zion film, ‘Captives of the Mighty.’ Hassan took to Instagram to apologise after the picture of his role as Iguana surfaced online. The picture of Hassan as Iguana got mixed feelings from fans, who had different opinions about his character and person. The actor is described as horror to many while as a kid. In response to comments, Hassan took to the comment sections to respond as he took the comments in his stride. He apologised for those who felt scared of his role as Iguana, saying it is all acting. “God is faithful. For those who are scared of my role in Captives of the Mighty (Iguana 2000) I apologize. It was my innocent way of interpreting the role. Its all acting. I thank God for the Holy Spirit that i am alive, hale and hearty on my feet.  ” I played Natas in the Heretic in 1985/86. No Cassette, No VCD then. See how one’s past can impact on future generations? It was just acting….but the comments really scared me! Thanks,” he stated. The actor also noted that he has acted in a handful of other gospel movies but that people do not seem to forget the one he played a bad character. He used the opportunity to tell fans that negative comments should not be encouraged as saying a foreign actor once took his life because of negative comments from fans over a role. “It was such overwhelming comments that made Christopher Lee hang himself. He felt bad that people hated him for the role he played in a horror movie. I’ve acted in a handful of gospel messages, but people don’t forget the negative roles.” Dr. Doyin Hassan started professional acting in 1985 with ‘The Heretic’ a Babs-Fashina and Jimi Odumosu production nominated for The Nigerian Festival of Television Programmes (NIFETEP ’86).
