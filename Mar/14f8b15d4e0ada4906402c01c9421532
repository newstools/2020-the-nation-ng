Due to Tonye’s Cole accomplishments many youths look up to the co-founder of Sahara Group. Cole was the guest of the first edition of Under 40 CEOs Live held at the Enterprise Development Centre of the Pan-Atlantic University, Lagos, recently. After spending quality time with the CEOs, he was inducted into their Hall Of Fame. The induction came as recognition for his contribution towards building a new generation of business leaders and playing a rock-solid role for many young Africans to emulate. Earlier in a frank assessment of African entrepreneurs, he said: “Your business can be a multi-million dollar business, but you don’t have to be a multi-million dollar person. That way, you can build a business that outlives you.” He also urged emerging entrepreneurs to desist from chasing money, adding: “Chase purpose instead, thereafter money will come. Don’t take networking for granted; everywhere you go, build meaningful relationships.” Cole, who desired to become the governor of Rivers State in the last election, has been directly responsible for building the Sahara Group’s global expansion and upholding her corporate governance principles. He has never stopped working to inspire African youths through charities and other means at his reach.
