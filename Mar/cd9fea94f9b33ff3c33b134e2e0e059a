The Adamawa/Taraba Command of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) on Monday traced bags of foreign rice hidden in a private residence in Yola, the Adamawa State capital, and impounded them. Officials of the service stormed the residence in Doubeli, a community in the Jimeta metropolis of Yola, and packed the 50kg bags of rice into their vehicles and took them to the Adamawa/Taraba headquarters of the NCS in the Zone 3 area of Jimeta. The NCS has long been seizing foreign rice in pursuit of its fight against contraband goods, which may have promoted the owner of the seized rice to choose to keep his rice in a residential building far away from markets that NCS usually raid. Addressing newsmen on how the NCS got on to its latest onslaught against contraband rice, the Public Relations Officer of the Adamawa/Taraba Command of the NCS, Mu’awuya Abubakar, said the command was duly informed by someone who knew of the illegal activity. “We got to know about this place from information that some individuals now at largewere smuggling foreign rice and hiding here,” he said. He said the seizure was in furtherance of the determination by the NCS to ensure that foreign rice which managed to get from the international borderlines into communities do not get sold to consumers. He cautioned landlords to be wary of what their tenants use their properties for, as landlords would be liable where their properties are found to have been used for illicit activities. He added that the house in Doubeli from where the foreign rice had been impounded would be sealed for as long as it took for investigations to be concluded. The exact number of the 50 kg bags of rice found and removed from the Doubeli house was yet to be determined by press time, but Mu’awuya Abubakar who said counting was yet to be done, added that the bags would be in hundreds. He also said no arrest had been made as the NCS was yet to get at the suspected owner of the impounded rice.
