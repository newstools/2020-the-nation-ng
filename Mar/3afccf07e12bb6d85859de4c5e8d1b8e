Organisers of the prestigious Nigeria Pitch Awards are set to name the nominees for the 7th edition of the awards on March 17 at the  Ikeja Ibis Hotel in Lagos according to the awards’ president Shina Philips who made this known in Lagos, stated that. He said it was customary to have a gathering of sports editors and journalists where the names of those shortlisted for the awards would be released after the votes were collated by SIAO Partners. Since its inaugural edition in 2013, the Nigeria Pitch Awards has continued to set a high standard for measuring individual and team achievements in football in Nigeria. The scientific and impeccable voting process adopted by organisers meets the standard practice adopted by the best award systems in the world. This is why the awards have been hailed as credible and transparent. “Voting for the 7th edition of the Nigeria Pitch Awards was done by over 100 Sports Editors spread across the 36 states  and the Federal Capital Territory,” explained Phillips.“ We are grateful to all our voters across Nigeria who took part in the process to ensure that the Nigeria Pitch Awards will continue to honour Nigeria’s best in football and encourage excellence in sports.’ The pre- and post- award performances of award winners have become benchmarks for judging talents, industry and performance among Nigerian footballers and officials.
