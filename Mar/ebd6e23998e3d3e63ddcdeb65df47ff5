 MANAGEMENT staff of Surulere Local Government has assured that the 2020 fiscal policy of the council would be geared towards boosting its current internally generated revenue. Giving this assurance at the weekend was the Executive Chairman, Hon. Tajudeen Ajide.  He spoke at the budget retreat tagged: “Budget of Transformation” at Orchid Hotels, Ikota-Lekki, Lagos. According to him, there is need to critically discuss the framework for the 2020 budget by “looking at the key priorities and deliverables for the year so as to be able to manage our total expenditures for areas such as health, education, infrastructure, security, empowerment, welfare and so on.” The council boss, who was represented by the Vice Chairman, Hon. Sulaiman Yussuf, appreciated the members of the executive for their patience, understanding and sacrifices made over the years for Surulere to progress just as he also extended the same appreciation to the management team for their doggedness and zeal in supporting the Administration. Speaking to the participant during the technical session, Mr Femi Lamina, the facilitator from Lagos State Planners Association said everyone is a stakeholder in the budget of the local government. He said when budget is approved it becomes a law and everything done against or outside the dictate of its content is a criminal offence.
