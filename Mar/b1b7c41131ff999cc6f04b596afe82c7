The marketing subcommittee for the 20th National Sports Festival (NSF) tagged Edo 2020 said broadcast signals are still available for interested television stations for a fee. Supersport Nigeria was named the host broadcaster for the festival and will beam live to sports lovers across the African continent on pay television but Mike Itemuagbor, chairman of the marketing subcommittee said signals for terrestrial broadcasting of the event are still available on first come, first served basis. “This is to let television stations in Nigeria know that signals for the broadcast of the Edo 2020 National Sports Festival on terrestrial television are available. Interested television stations should contact the marketing subcommittee for discussion. We are aware they pay to air international sports events. This is the international standard and Nigeria cannot pretend to be different when it comes to broadcasting and media rights for events organised in Nigeria by Nigerians,”‘ said Itemuagbor. He added that he wanted history to remember Edo state and organisers of the 20th National Sports Festival for redefining everything about sports marketing, broadcasting and media rights. “We want to use the Edo 2020 National Sports Festival to not only redefine the technical and administrative organisation of such a multi-sports event, but also want to redefine broadcasting and media rights for the biggest sporting event in Nigeria,” he said. The opening and closing ceremonies of the festival including finals of the football event for men and women and major events in track and field including the men and women’s 100m, 4x100m and 4x400m relays will be beamed live to Nigerians and the entire African continent.
