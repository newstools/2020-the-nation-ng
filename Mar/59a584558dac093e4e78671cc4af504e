 Fortune has smiled on a five-year-old boxing prodigy, Ayomide Adeyemo, and his family. Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, seems to understand that the best way to harness talents is to catch them young. Hence, he has taken it upon himself to sponsor Ayomide Adeyemo. This happened after a documentary on Adeyemo went viral on social media. The minister said: “Sequel to the viral video of a talented baby boy boxer on social media pages, I will be putting the baby in a boxing academy for further growth and also sponsor his education. Some financial stipends will be given for the upkeep of the lad as well.” Currently, Adeyemo is being trained by his father after school hours at their residence in Paruwa area of Lagos. In the viral video, Adeyemo’s father, mother and teacher explained how the little boy had shown undying interest in boxing. According to his father, who trains boxers for a living, he will go to any length to ensure his child achieves his dream of becoming a great boxer.
