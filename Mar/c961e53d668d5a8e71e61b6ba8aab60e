 A COMBINED team of the Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency (LASEPA) and Lagos State Safety Commission have sealed Prime Mall Mega Plaza located in Lekki and three other event Centres for flouting the government’s directive on public gathering. The other three are Imperial, Regency and Maltinos Suites all at Olowopopo in the Central Business District, Alausa, Ikeja. One of the event centres was billed to hold a wedding reception. The action followed Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s directive on ban of public gathering above 20 people. LASEPA General Manager, Dr Dolapo Fasawe said that safety of Lagosians was paramount to the government. According to her, the enforcement team swung into action in compliance with the governor’s directive. She admitted that most event centres complied with the directive while a few failed to. Among the areas visited, she said, included, a film house at Lekki, Shoprite, Balmoral, Federal Palace Hotel and The Dome amongst others. She said: “The ban on public/social gathering by Mr Governor became imperative to save our dear state and prevent our people from contacting the virus. CONVID-19 has become a global pandemic, therefore adequate measures must be taken to reduce the spread and stem the outbreak of the pandemic. “It’s advisable we adopt social distancing, by keeping at least six feet distance between ourselves. For now, let us avoid crowding and large gatherings such as weddings, concerts, sporting events, conferences and so forth. We are not unmindful of the implications of the restrictions, but it is crucial we limit and control the spread. Lagos State is not in isolation, it’s a global pandemic, and therefore, efforts to suppress and push it back for the safety of all’. According to her, the inspection and monitoring exercise was not to impose hardship on them but to access the compliance level, educate the public on the need to obey and ensure total compliance.
