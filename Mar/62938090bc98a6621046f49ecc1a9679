 Ekiti People’s Democratic Party(PDP) chairmanship aspirant, Dr. Tope Aluko, has rejected the consensus candidacy arrangements mooted by some elders of the party for the forthcoming congress slated for April 2, 2020. Aluko vowed to oppose the consensus candidacy being mooted by factional elders and stakeholders caucus of the party, saying every contenders must be ready to test his popularity at the congress. The PDP elders had last Saturday adopted and endorsed Kolawole, who is being prodded by former Governor Ayodele Fayose, for the plum seat. Addressing journalists on Tuesday in Ado-Ekiti, Aluko said he and other aspirants are not parties to the consensus arrangement, describing the purported endorsement as a mere ruse. He added that the fact that a group under the auspices of the PDP Elders’ forum endorsed Kolawole didn’t translate to consensus allegedly being pushed by a certain interest in the party. Aluko maintained that only the interested aspirants can reach consensus among themselves to avert unnecessary heated election in th PDP, being the main opposition party in the state. He said such move can’t be imposed on the party, warning that it would lead to crisis of monumental proportion that would be difficult for the party to resolve. “I was at the forum where we met with the PDP elders . It was more of consultation by Hon. Kolawole and the endorsement by the elders doesn’t translate to any form of consensual agreement in our party. “The Constitution of the party is very clear, once any of the aspirants insists on election, consensus can’t work, it can’t be imposed. “A lot of groups have adopted my aspiration and I never regarded these as consensual agreement. The proponents of consensus are causing confusion among our members. “I want my supporters to be firm and discountenance such rumour, because I am still in the race and I remain committed to the cause of winning and rebrand our party and return it to its winning streak in Ekiti,” he said.
