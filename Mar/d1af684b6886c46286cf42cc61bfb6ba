The Lagos State Government on Thursday announced that it will shut down PWD Level Crossing on Saturday from 6pm, to 6am on Sunday, for the laying of the standard gauge train track on Ikeja axis. A statement from the Ministry of Transportation, said alternative routes have been provided for road users to utilise during the 12-hour construction. Motorists plying PWD Level Crossing, according to the statement, will be diverted to Ashade Underpass, by Idi Mongoro, to join Ikeja Along, or climb Airport Bridge by Ikeja General Hospital, to link Oshodi Motorway, to ensure reaching their destinations with ease. “Road users are advised to comply with the traffic directions to minimise inconvenience. “The closure has been slated at this time to ensure there is smooth and uninterrupted flow of work on the rail tracks. “Lagos State Government is hereby appealing to residents, especially motorists, to bear with us, as the project is aimed at achieving a seamless multi modal transport system that will meet the transportation needs of a larger population,” the statement said.
