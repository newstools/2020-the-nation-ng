  PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari is healthy and fully in charge of the affairs of the nation, the Federal Government and the Presidency said on Thursday. Minister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed and Special Adviser, Media and Publicity to the President Femi Adesina spoke separately in Abuja. The duo said the President had tested negative to the dreaded virus and dismissed social media speculations on his status Mohammed said President Buhari is not coughing, adding: “the President is well, healthy, fit and fully in charge of the country. Some have alleged that the President is coughing; it is fake news.” On when the President will address the nation on COVID-19, Mohammed said: “I can assure you that at the appropriate time, the President will address Nigerians.” In his tweet @FemAdesina, the special adviser assured that President Buhari had been busy working to keep Nigerians safe from the ravaging pandemic. He also lashed out at some people, who he alleged had been spreading false information about the President. Adesina said those spreading lies and evil had been afflicted with diseased mind and incapable of clean and edifying thoughts. Adesina’s tweet reads:  ”Why do some people imagine vain things and concoct lies and evil? Simple: their minds are diseased, and incapable of clean and edifying thoughts. President Buhari is on top of ensuring that Nigerians are kept safe from Covid-19. The good work continues.” Although the presidential spokesman was not specific about those he was referring to or their actual offence, there were indications he might have been reacting to an audio making the rounds on social media that President Muhammadu Buhari and his Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari, has been flown out for medical attention abroad. President Buhari was in his office at the State House on Wednesday. President Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo have tested negative to COVID-19.
