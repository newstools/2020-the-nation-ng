 THE first quarter Ground Round, a discussion roundtable, of Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital (EKSUTH), has called on workers to embrace Public-Private Partnership (PPP) to boost infrastructural facilities. EKSUTH’s Chief Medical Director Prof. Kayode Olabanji, who spoke on ‘Alternative Healthcare Financing Public Private Partnership, the way to go’, said healthcare practice was tasking and the government could not do everything. The CMD noted that the quest for standard, up to date practices and cutting edge tools make Public-Private Partnership inevitable. Guest Speaker and Medical Director of Federal Medical Centre at Ebute-Meta in Lagos Dr. Juwon Dada affirmed that Public Private Partnership was the way to go if quality and modern infrastructure were to be acquired. Juwon, who spoke through Dr. Olorunfemi Ayoola, quoted World Health Organisation’s (WHO’s) description of health care financing as an aspect of health care concerned with accumulation, mobilisation and allocation of money to cover the health needs of the people individually and collectively. He said the venture followed government’s initiative to encourage the private sector as an alternative source of fund to bridge the gap.
