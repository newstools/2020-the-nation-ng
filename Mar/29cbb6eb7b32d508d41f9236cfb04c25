Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, on Saturday, described the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, as “an inspirational political leader and champion of national unity and development.” Lawan in a statement by his Special Adviser (Media) also felicitated with Tinubu – a former Senator and a two-term governor of Lagos State – who turns 68 years on Sunday. “All through his political life, Asiwaju Tinubu has doggedly groomed leaders, set development templates and built bridges for national integration and cohesion, all of which he sees as necessary tools for robust development and great nationhood. “Asiwaju Tinubu’s concept of leadership enables him to motivate associates and inspire in them confidence and loyalty. His imprints are indelible on politics and governance at the sub-national and national levels in Nigeria,” Lawan said. The statement reads in part: “The Senate President rejoice with him, his family, friends and political associates on the auspicious occasion. “He prayed that the Almighty Allah grants him many more years of service to humanity and his beloved Nigeria.”
