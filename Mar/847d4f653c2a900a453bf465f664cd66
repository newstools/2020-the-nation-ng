The Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF) has announced that a new FIBA Certification Table Officials course will take place between April 27 and May 27. According to the memo issued by the NBBF Secretary General, Afolabi-Oluwayemi Olabisi, more Nigerians will again have a chance of becoming Federation of International Associations certified Table Official for the 2019-2021 cycle. Successful candidates will be eligible and available for nominations and selections during the 2021 FIBA continental cups and 2023 World Cup pre-qualifiers across the world. Commenting on this initiative, the NBBF President, Engr Musa Kida said, “After the last round of training facilitated by the federation in 2018, many young faces came on board which opened them to endless opportunities in the game at home and abroad. Skills of our table officials improved which had positive effects on our local basketball scene while many were on also on duty during the various championships held across Africa.” “Before we came on board, our officials never had opportunities to undergo these type of training. Interested persons had to travel out of Nigeria which was more expensive and prevented many from participating. We highlighted this and made it a point of duty to bring such juicy opportunities closer to our people.” To be eligible for this, all applicants must be able to communicate in English and be 65 years old or less at the end of the cycle. Interested candidates who have been a table official at the highest national level in last five (5) years should contact the NBBF Secretariat to collect free forms. April 20 has been fixed as deadline for the collection and submission of duly filled forms.
