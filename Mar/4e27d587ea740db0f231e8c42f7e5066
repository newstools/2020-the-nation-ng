 Former England striker Alan Shearer has ranked Sergio Aguero ahead of Thierry Henry in his list of the Premier League’s all-time greatest goalscorers. Shearer – who still holds the record for the most goals in the Premier League with 260 – placed himself above both the Argentine and the Frenchman, as he and fellow Match of the Day pundits Gary Lineker and Ian Wright debated which striker was the greatest on their latest BBC Sounds podcast. “Aguero is now coming up to his 32nd birthday and he’s still banging in the goals left, right and centre,” the former Newcastle United legend argued. “I know he’s playing in a magnificent team but 180-odd goals, 260 appearances and look what he’s won also. “I love both of them, Thierry was different. The role now as a forward has slightly changed. “There’s not so many centre-forwards now, it’s a forward but the one constant is you have to score goals and both of them are not only great goalscorers but scorers of great goals.” Aguero is now the Premier League’s highest-scoring foreign player with 180 goals in 261 matches, overtaking Henry’s 176 strikes in 258 matches this campaign.
