 THE Lagos state first lady, Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu has thrown her weight behind Saidi Balogun’s new film, ‘The Scourge’. Mrs Sanwo-Olu joined dignitaries that attended the screening of the film, which delves into the recent increase in drug abuse as well as profer solution to what is becoming a menace. The first lady also witnessed the unveiling of ‘Be the Change’ club, which is created to be a support system for the eradication of drug abuse. Speaking on the film, Saidi Balogun noted that he collaborated with Trauma Savers Life Support Foundation, a non-governmental organisation (NGO), to produce a movie titled ‘The Scourge’. “The way the youth go into drugs, is quite alarming. Follow the movie not what the actor is doing. Watch the movie to the end and then you will see that it sets. Those things we do for fun, actors put light into many things we don’t know. They include that we do for fun that can throw our future away. Let’s take the message home and keep it,” he said. The actor stressed that messages being passed across in movies should be learned and put to good use. The movie began showing round secondary schools across states in Nigeria in 2019 after it was completed. ‘The Scourge’ features Wole Ojo, Richard Agbor, Tobi Bakare, Saidi Balogun, Jide Kosoko, Patrick Doyle, Allwell Ademola, among others.
