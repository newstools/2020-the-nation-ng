 Phil Mickelson has hinted that a sequel to “The Match” against Tiger Woods is in the pipeline, and could even take place during the current suspension of professional golf. Mickelson was asked on social media about the possibility of a rematch with Woods being live streamed in the near future, and the left-hander surprised many when he replied: “Working on it.” And when another fan tweeted Mickelson asking him not to “tease”, the veteran responded: “I don’t tease. I’m kinda a sure thing.” The original instalment of “The Match” took place in November 2018 at Shadow Creek Golf Club on the outskirts of Las Vegas, with Mickelson winning the $9m showdown on the fourth play-off hole. Mickelson finally landed the lucrative prize with a birdie under floodlights on a specially-constructed 93-yard par-three, although the encounter was notable for its general lack of quality and interaction between the two star draws.  Woods and Mickelson also contrived a number of side bets during the encounter, wagers which totalled $800,000 that were dispersed around various charities afterwards. The showdown did not sit well with Sky Sports Golf commentator Ewen Murray, who said: “I thought “The Match” between Tiger and Phil was grotesque. “I hope that is not an indication of the future for golf. I don’t want to dwell on it too much, but I just think the sport can do without that kind of format. “To have two players with a combined age of 90 playing for $9m was completely unnecessary. It’s just wrong to play for that amount of money in a one-off, made-for-television exhibition. And I sincerely hope this was a one-off event. “Woods and Mickelson are in the autumn of their careers and I felt they should have had no part in this. It  represented everything that I do not want to see in our great sport.”
