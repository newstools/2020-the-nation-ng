A royal wedding will always stand out. Always glamourous and full of merriment, it attracts quality people from all walks of life. Princess Bian, first daughter of traditional ruler of Obosi land, Anambra, Igwe Chidubem Iweka, recently held her traditional marriage, and it was everything you could think of a royal wedding. The groom, Dr. Arinze Chizobam Nweke, is the son of Chief Hyacinth Nweke. Despite being a king, Igwe Iweka knows the importance of women’s respect for their men. Advising her daughter to always love, respect and obey her husband, he told her to ignore her royal background. Similarly, the traditional ruler encouraged the husband to discover the secret to his wife’s heart, love her like a jewel and ensure that misunderstandings should be settled before a day ends.
