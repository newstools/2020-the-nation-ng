A stiff penalty of at least five years in prison, without option of fine, awaits those who violate the National Fertiliser Quality (Control) Act 2019. The Act, assented to by President Muhammadu Buhari last October, prohibits the unauthorised activities of manufacturers, blenders or importers and distributors of fertiliser. The Act also stipulates the procedure for obtaining permits or certificate of registration; provides certainty of time frame for issuance of authorisation by the prescribed authority; as well as establishment of grievance remedial mechanism where application is declined. Speaking at the public presentation of the Act in Abuja on Tuesday, Prof Yemi Akinseye-George (SAN), who introduced the Act to the public, said such offences include manufacturing, blending, importing or distributing of deficient fertiliser, lacking in plant nutrient specified in the First Schedule to the Act.
