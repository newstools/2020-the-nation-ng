We are deeply grateful to every health care worker and person who has risked their life to fight this pandemic and will continue to support them.” The Group hailed the proactive efforts of the government and all the corporates who have come forward in this hour of need. “We stand in solidarity with the health care personnel, the police, the immigration personnel, the customs, the aviation authorities, the factories working to produce essential items in this time of need, and all people acting responsibly to contain the pandemic, ” Vaswani said.
