 NIGERIAN equities lost N209 billion on Monday as investors overlooked earnings and dividend yields and opened up market orders to close transactions at lower prices. With weak macroeconomic outlook and global scare over the Coronavirus crisis, more than three of four transactions at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) yesterday were closed at lower prices. Benchmark indices indicated average decline of 1.53 per cent, equivalent to net capital depreciation of N209 billion. Many large-cap quoted companies including Nestle Nigeria, MTN Nigeria Communications, Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB) and United Bank for Africa (UBA) had released their full-year audited results with dividend recommendations. Dividend yields were in double digits for many stocks but these failed to lift the market. The All Share Index (ASI)- the value-based index that tracks all share prices at the Exchange, declined from its opening index of 26,216.46 points to close at 25,816.57 points. Aggregate market value of all quoted companies dropped from its opening value of N13.658 trillion to close at N13.449 trillion. Average year-to-date return worsened to -3.82 per cent. With 28 decliners to nine advancers, all sectoral indices closed in the red with the exception of the NSE Insurance Index, which rose by 0.3 per cent. The NSE Consumer Goods Index dropped by 5.19 per cent. The NSE Banking Index declined by 3.66 per cent. The NSE Industrial Goods Index dipped by 1.22 per cent while the NSE Oil and Gas Index slipped by 0.35 per cent. Nestle Nigeria led the decliners with a loss of N113 to close at N1,017.
