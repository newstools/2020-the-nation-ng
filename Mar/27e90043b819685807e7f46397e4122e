 THE Osun State House of Assembly on Tuesday passed the Bill prohibiting kidnapping, banditry and ritual killings  in the state. The Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Timothy Owoeye said said, “Where the life of the person kidnapped, restrained or seized is lost in the process, the kidnapper is liable on conviction and will be sentenced to death.” He noted that any person who kidnaps another person by any means or instilling fear or tricks or compels another to do anything against his will commits an offence.
