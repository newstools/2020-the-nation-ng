Vice President Yemi Osinbajo (SAN) has described former Lagos State governor and National Leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, as a visionary leader. Osinbajo, in a message he personally penned to mark the 68th birthday anniversary of Asiwaju Tinubu, observed that the party leader’s political career had inspired millions of people. While observing the Asiwaju Tinubu’s vision had produced many leaders from his large followers and proteges, he regretted that the current emergency situation inflicted on the globe by the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic had made it impossible to observe the yearly solution Bola Tinubu Colloquium, which had spoken answers to many of Nigeria’s leadership problems in the last 12 years. “Today, we celebrate Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, a visionary, transformative leader and patriot. Your exceptional political career and service has inspired millions. It is true that few leaders have developed as many leaders from the ranks of their protégés as you have done. “Your incredibly large and generous heart, political astuteness and uncommon intellect have become the stuff of legend. “Today, but for COVID-19 we would, as we have done in the past twelve years, celebrated this day with the Bola Tinubu Colloquium, where we do what is your greatest passion – proffering answers to developmental questions.  We will by God’s grace, still do this and many more. “I pray for you sir, that as your days, so shall your strength, wisdom and favour be with God, in Jesus name,” the Vice President said.
