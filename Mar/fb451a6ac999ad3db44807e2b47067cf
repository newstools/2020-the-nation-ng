A minor, Progress Life, 13 year old who allegedly stabbed the son of a police sergeant, Marvellous Ekrake,15 , lamented that he did not mean to kill his friend. He said his intention was to threaten his friend with the knife. Progress was arrested and taken to the Ughelli Police station by his family. The Nation gathered that both friends lived with their parents as neighbours at the Police Barrack, Ughelli. In the suspects confessional statement,he said, “I never meant to kill him,I only wanted to threaten him with the knife. Continuing,”After we completed the job for the woman earlier on that day,we were paid N300 and Marvellous decided to take N200 which I objected that the money ought to be shared equally but he insisted, claiming that he would take the larger share because he was older. “Angered by this,I reported the matter to my father who advised that I allow him take the money.Later that evening, while he was playing with our toy,I warned him to stop playing with the toy.I collected the toy and three it inside my father’s room with a warning that I will stab him if he enters the room. Despite my warning, Marvellous insisted that he would go into my father’s room to collect the toy,which he did,and it was in that process that he was stabbed.I ran away after stabbing him.I didn’t know that he would die.I did not know how the whole incident happened.”
