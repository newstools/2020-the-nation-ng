Gospel singer, Tope Alabi, recently had a taste of social media bullies or critics following what was termed her “worldly dance” in a viral video. The popular stance was that, through her dance steps, she wasn’t practicing what she preached in her songs. Reacting to the video in an interview, Alabi stated that she needed that dance at that time. According to the gospel singer, she was dancing at her father’s burial and people with “spiritual eyes” would understand its meaning. Her attempt to further explain why she did the “worldly dance” was met with even harsher criticism. But it seems the singer has moved on from the attacks. She was in a jolly mood while thrilling guests recently at Deaconess Oluremi Domingo’s 60th birthday organised by her husband, Senator Domingo Obende.
