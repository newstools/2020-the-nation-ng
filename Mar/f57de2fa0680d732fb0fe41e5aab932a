MTN at the weekend said it was working to end paper pollution in the country with its efforts to digitalise airtime loading. It said the step aligned with Federal Government’s efforts at ridding the environment of paper pollution. Its Chief Sales and Distribution Officer, Adekunle Adebiyi, who spoke during the unveiling the telco’s repackaged virtual top-up (VTU) now MTN Topit, said the telco is committed to a clean and healthy environment. He said Topit provides an efficient means of recharge for data and airtime distribution across diverse forms of electronic recharge. With improved user experience, it mitigates against any perceived price distortions and eliminates the irregularities associated with recharge PINs /vouchers/cards. With Topit, MTN customers can buy airtime as low as N1 and up to N3 million. Adebiyi said: “We have launched this platform as part of our continuous drive to make customers’ lives easier, brighter and better. We believe in a modern connected world, one in which our customers can get solutions at the snap of their fingers. This is what Topit delivers. We are excited at the amazing opportunities this platform offers our customers, retailers and trade partners.” It is also beneficial to retailers, trade partners and potential new partners as it provides ease of entry to start a recharge business, while saving costs of warehousing and inventory management. The electronic recharge forms include phone-to-phone, PoS, bank’s ATM, MTN’s website and MyMTN App.
