Several motorists and commuters plying the Funsho Williams Avenue through Alaka to Lagos Island on Monday expressed the anguish experienced on the route in the last one week.They told the News Agency of Nigeria {NAN} that this was caused by the gridlock as a result of the closure of the Lagos inbound lane of  the Eko Bridge from Alaka on Lagos Mainland  for repairs. The closure had brought untold hardship to commuters and motorists plying the Funsho Williams Avenue enroute  Costain, Ijora, Orile-Iganmu to Lagos Island. The Lagos State Government had announced the emergency closure of Eko Bridge inward Apongbon and released the traffic diversion plan last week. The government stated that the segment of Eko Bridge Inward Apongbon from Alaka through the front of the National Theatre Complex would be closed to all traffic from 12 midnight on March 10, to allow for a detailed investigation of distressed bearings observed along that segment of the bridge. The government said that the scope of work and duration for the repair would be determined by the outcome of its investigation. All the alternative routes in Surulere, Yaba, Oyingbo and others were locked down which forced several commuters to resort to trekking from the National Stadium and other parts of the state to their destinations. Most commercial bus operators plying Ikorodu Road had abandoned the Funsho Williams Avenue route, while those who dared and hiked their fares terminated their trips either at Barracks or National Stadium Bus stops due to the gridlock. It was also observed that the perennial gridlock had led to altercations between commuters and many motorists who were forced to terminate their trips at various bus stops other than their bargained ones because of the traffic. Some commuters condemned the development, regretting that if they had known, they would not have embarked on such journeys as motorists were seen trying to beat the gridlock by maneuvering through the inner streets of Surulere. A commercial bus operator plying the Mile 12-Orile Iganmu route, Samson Atanda, , told NAN that the gridlock was always tough in the morning hours when most workers were going to their work places
