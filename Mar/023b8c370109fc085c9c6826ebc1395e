  Following a 28 seconds video of an accident scene that surfaced on social media at the early hours of Monday involving a bike man and a black KIA jeep with registration number LA996AO1, the Management of Obafemi Awolowo University Ile-Ife, Osun State have dismissed the claim that the bike man died. In the video, a middle-aged man was filmed lying down on the floor unconsciously while sympathisers were shouting in a bid to rescue the victim. A source contacted on the campus said the accident happened along Fajuyi hall. While the OAU Public Relations Officer Mr. Abiodun Olarewaju was contacted on phone, he dismissed the rumor. He said, “I have called one of my staff on the purported video and I have confirmed that nobody died. “The accident that happened around Fajuyi Hall road is unfortunate but nobody died. It was just a minor mishap between an Okada rider and a motorist. The accident we as a result of impatience” He appealed to motorists to be patient when plying the roads inside the campus.
