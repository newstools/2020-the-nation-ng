The Coalition for A Better Nigeria has urged the federal and state governments to enforce social distancing in markets and bus parks. It advised that market associations and the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) be compelled to implement the directive. The Coalition’s National Coordinator, Awa Bamiji, stated this in a statement. Bamiji said: “The three tiers of government must do more on enforcement of social spacing and making sure that the NURTW and market associations follow these laid down Government directives.” He also urged the government to compel both organisations to “provide electric thermometers and alcohol-based hand sanitisers in all the motor parks, garages, b/stops , markets, buses and cabs, if they must open their businesses at all.” According to the group “Nigeria did not close our airports and seaports early enough to forestall uninterrupted flights that brought the Italian man and other cases that later followed into Nigeria. Nevertheless, it thanked the Federal Government for reducing the pump price of petrol from N145/litre to N125/litre. “We also advise the three tiers of governments, corporate bodies and wealthy individuals to start sharing both the relief and preventive packages to the downtrodden to make life easier for them at this period, like what is currently obtainable in other countries of the world,” Bamiji added.
