Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company (IBEDC) said it is committed to ensuring regular power supply if there is a national shutdown due to coronavirus (COVID-19). The electricity distribution company (DisCo) said its statutory duty will not be crippled by the pandemic as the management is prepared to service its esteemed customers through various online platforms for payment, vending of power and resolving customers’ complaints. IBEDC in its bid to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 is scaling down people’s presence in business locations to limit physical interaction between employees and customers until the situation improves. The management particularly instructed all customer relationship officers, commercial line workers and any other employee that interfaces with the customer to stop their activities immediately until they are well equipped to handle the situation. Similarly, gloves, hand sanitisers and medical masks have been distributed across its franchise to ensure the safety of all the staff on essential duties who cannot work remotely. IBEDC’s management is, therefore, strongly recommending that customers should call the customer care number 07001239999 to report faults and make enquiries; they should make use of our hassle-free payment platform such as www.festwallet.com, www.quickteller.com,USSD,M cash, transact or visit www.ibedc.com for more options. This is to further reduce physical contact to comply  with the  social distancing prevention protocol, it added.
