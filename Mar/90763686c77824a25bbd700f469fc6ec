The National Industrial Court in Port Harcourt, presided over by Justice Z  M. Bashir has granted an order of interim injunction stopping the proposed strike by Rivers state workers. The workers had vowed to begin a warning strike on March 24 following some unresolved issues including minimum wage. But the court in the order prevented the leadership of the organised labour in the State under Beatrice Itubo, Chairman, Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC); Austin Jonah, Chairman, Trade Union Congress (TUC) and the Joint Rivers Negotiating Council from proceeding on the industrial action. Parts of the order said: ” The National Industrial Court, Port Harcourt (presided over by Justice Z. M. Bashir, has granted an order of interim injuction restraining the defendants either by themselves or through their servants, agents, privies, officers or otherwise howsoever called from embarking on a strike on Monday 23rd March, 2020, or any other day thereafter, pending the hearing and determination of the substantive Motion on Notice filed in this suit. “The Trial court also granted an order of interim injunction restraining the defendants from interfering with the provision of services and other works by their members in the Civil Service of Rivers State pending the hearing and determination of the substantive Motion on notice filed in this suit”.
