West African Boxing Union (WABU) lightweight champion, Rilwan “Real One” Oladosu, has vowed that he will rip apart Ghana’s Emmanuel Quartey when they clash in the World Boxing Federation (WBF) International lightweight title bout on April 12. The title bout is the headline fight of Gotv Boxing Night 21 billed to hold at the Indoor Sports Hall of the National Stadium, Lagos. Speaking in an interview at his training base on Monday, the WABU champion, who is renowned for his flamboyance, boasted that he would add Quartey to the list of Ghanaians whom he has beaten. “I have defeated many Ghanaians and Quartey will be included in the list of my victims. An international title is at stake here. He is welcome to Nigeria, but he’ll end up being sorry,” Oladosu boasted. Two other title fights are scheduled for GOtv Boxing Night 21. They are the WBF Africa welterweight title between Rilwan “Baby Face” Babatunde of Nigeria, the WABU welterweight champion, and Mkwalekwa Salehe of Tanzania; and a national bantamweight title contest between Sadiq “Happy Boy” Adeleke and Tunde Olojede. Daniel “Big Shark” Emeka will square up against Segun “Success” Olanrewaju in a national light heavyweight challenge bout, while Alaba “Elyblow” Omotola will face Lateef Akintola in a national lightweight challenge contest. GOtv Boxing Night 21 will be beamed live on Africa’s biggest sport channel, SuperSport, in 47 African countries.
