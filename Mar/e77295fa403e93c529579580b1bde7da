 Nigerians have been urged to join the advocacy to the National Assembly to amend the Universal Basic Education (UBE) Act to extend its coverage from junior secondary to senior secondary schools (SSS). The UBE Act which became Law in 2004 stipulates nine years of basic education, comprising six years of primary and three years of junior secondary education. Championing the advocacy during a media engagement on Community Led Collective Action for Girls Education (C-CAGE) sponsored by Malala Fund in Yola, Adamawa State, the Executive Director, African Centre for Leadership, Strategy & Development (LSD), Mr. Monday Osasah, said extending the benefits of UBE to senior secondary school level will help especially girls to complete their secondary education. “Everyone should join in the advocacy to the National Assembly to amend the Universal Basic Education Act to extend and fill in the gap and improve girl enrolment and retention through senior secondary school (SSS),” Osasah said. He said too many students were terminating their secondary education at the junior secondary school level rather than going on to complete the SSS, adding that LSD would work towards ensuring that girls get the education they require to live better lives. “As a nongovernmental organisation, we remain catalytic in our approach by doing what we are known for and continuing to champion and push for 12 years of free, safe and quality education for all girls,” he said.
