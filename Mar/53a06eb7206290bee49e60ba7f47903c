CHELSEA could be without nine frontline stars for tomorrow’s Premier League clash with Everton at Stamford Bridge. Callum Hudson-Odoi has suffered a recurrence of his hamstring injury, in his first full training session back with Chelsea’s first team. Boss Frank Lampard has branded Chelsea’s injury glut as the worst among the Premier League’s top sides, with Mateo Kovacic out of the clash with an Achilles problem.  Brazil forward Willian will face a late fitness test on his own Achilles issue, while Lampard revealed Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Christian Pulisic played in an “in-house game” at Chelsea’s training ground yesterday. Jorginho starts a two-match league suspension, while N’Golo Kante is still out with an adductor problem, Andreas Christensen remains doubtful and Tammy Abraham is out with his ankle complaint.
