 THE estate surveying and valuation profession should contribute to development, an expert has said. Speaking at an event organised by estate valuers in Lagos, Olusola Solomon Enitan said while major contributions had been made by the profession to the nation, there was the need to re-rig it for better performance. He said estate surveying and valuation is geared towards building a virile society where value is determined by the economic cost of business and social activities. He however regretted that in the last few years, the fortunes of  his colleagues had dwindled, a probelm, he said, led to the erosion of integrity. He said: “Opportunities for the professional expression are daily lost to charlatans and other non- professional entities. Outright limitations were placed in our way by public sectoral organisations who ought to be beneficiaries of our skills.The professional reputation dwindled immensely, job losses became almost a daily occurrence.” Enitan said large financial  organisations, which were their greatest patrons, have expressed  grave dissatisfaction with their  products,  adding that this has   negative impacted on their  remuneration. He, however, called for proper positioning of the profession and adherence to ethics, as a way out of the woods.
