 SPECIAL Offences and Domestic Violence Court in Ikeja, Lagos on Tuesday sentenced a 52 -year -old man, Folorunso Oluwaseun, to 40 years imprisonment for defiling his own daughter. Justice Sybil Nwaka while delivering judgment, described the convict as “the devil incarnate,  wicked and satanic”  after finding him guilty of sexually assaulting his daughter for over four years. Oluwaseun, an electrician and father of five children, three girls and two boys, was convicted for having sexual intercourse with his 18-year-old daughter for four years in order to enhance her private parts. The court heard that the convict started having sex with his daughter at age 12 and was caught in the act by his estranged wife when the girl was 17.  Justice Nwaka found him guilty of sexual assault and defilement of a minor. Justice Nwaka said, “This defendant is wicked, callous, satanic and devilish. What manner of father would sexually assault his own daughter for a long period of time without any sense of remorse? This defendant starves his own children for sex. “He is nothing but the devil incarnate. Releasing this kind of man to the society would amount to unleashing mayhem to other girl-children in our society. “I encourage mothers to report callous husbands who tend to prey on their children. I hereby find this defendant, Folorunso Oluwaseun, guilty of both charges and sentence him to 40 years in prison,” the judge ruled.  The 18-year-old girl, during her evidence in court, said that the sexual abuse began when she was 12-years old while she was living with her father at their Ikorodu residence in Lagos. “In 2016, my mother came back to stay with us, she caught us one night when my father was trying to have sex with me. She screamed and my father threatened to kill her,” she said.
