 General Secretary of Nigeria Football Federation Dr. Sanusi Mohammed has charged the players and officials of  the  national women’s  U-17  team (Flamingoes) to secure the necessary away win against Guinea  in the  1st  leg of  the African Zone  FIFA  World Cup qualifier billed  for Conakry on  March 7th . Sanusi made this known when he visited their training pitch at the  Goal Project as the team is putting final touches for their preparations towards achieving a better result away. He assure the players and officials that whatever they needed would be provided for  the team to have an excellent outing. He said: ” You see last we did not do well in most of our outings in terms of CAF/FIFA  competitions . The Federation is highly interested in seeing all our National teams qualify for all competitions locally or internationally.  Guinea  is good in female football so you most take them serious. “Play them as if you are playing FIFA World Cup final to the make the 2nd leg a mere formality game.  You know this game would have been played last week but had to be shifted as requested by Guinea Football Federation due General election. “ You must prove that Nigeria is still the best in Africa Football by coming BAVK with a victory. You have been in camp for a month now and I know you have learnt a lot from your coaches. Said Sanusi. The head of NFF Technical Department Bitrus Bewarang assured the head of NFF Secretariat that the team will record the needed away victory. “The Coaches have really worked on the girls, though most of them are  first timers in international competitions but we have psychologically prepared them and I have now fear that they will do the needful”. The General Secretary further  revealed that the team and the officials would leave for Conakry on Thursday , March 5, ahead of the qualifying match scheduled for Saturday. This year’s FIFA U17 will hold in November in India.
