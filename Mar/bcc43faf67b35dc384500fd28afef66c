 Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide has  called Enugu  State Governor,  Ifeanyi Ugwuayi,  to investigate the circumstances surrounding the death of a septuagenarian who tested negative to  the dreaded Coronavirus. Shocked by the woman’s death, a lady who claimed to be the  daughter accused the Enugu University Teaching Hospital, ESUTH, of negligence. She also accused the Enugu State government of unpreparedness for the virus, despite the fact that the outbreak was reported in December. The OYC in a statement signed by the National President, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro and the General Secretary, Mazi Okwu Nnabuike, said:  “Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi should investigate the death of a 70 year old woman suspected of having the dreaded Coronavirus  irrespective of the accusations of the family that the woman died due to negligence of Enugu Government.  We are confident  that Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi will respond to this matter and condole the family for the loss “We also call on  the South East governors to shut down public places especially where there are crowd of more than 30 persons as a precautionary measures to curb the spread of Coronavirus in the South East, as many people are set to return home from abroad during the Easter festive season. There’s an urgent need to put measures to protect our citizens. “The OYC commends  the Federal Government for  the precautionary measures taken so far, especially in the areas of closing of borders, shutting down all Federal Government schools and colleges, including the Mallam Aminu Kano Int’l Airport, Akanu Ibiam Int’l Airport Enugu and PH Int’l Airport. The imposed travel ban on 13 countries  with high cases of Coronavirus is highly commendable. The Federal Government should also provide preventive measures at all motor parks, as there are poor preventive measures in all the motor parks across the country.
