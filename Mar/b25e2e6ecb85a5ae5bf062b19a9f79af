From Olalekan Okusan, Tunis, Tunisia  WHAT could have been a record for Nigeria’s Segun Toriola was halted by Egypt’s duo of Omar Assar and Dina Meshref after Segun Toriola and Olufunke Oshonaike lost in the final of mixed doubles finals of the Africa Olympic Qualifying Tournament held in Tunis. Toriola is aiming to become first African and table tennis world to attend eight Olympic Games but his ambition came to an end with the defeat to the Egyptians in the final. But there was consolation for Oshonaike who had earlier on Friday February 28 booked her place in Tokyo 2020 as the first African female athlete to attend seven Olympic Games. From the start of the match, it was swinging in favour of the Egyptians and they claim Africa’s sole slot in the mixed doubles with 11-6, 11-6, 11-7, 11-2.  A not-too-happy Toriola described it as disappointing but was grateful to God for the opportunity to feature in seven Olympic Games. “I wanted to try to make it to my eight Olympic Games unfortunately I could not but in all I am very happy with my career and to become the first African to attend seven Olympic Games. I hope upcoming players will take it from here. Olympic Games for me has been a great experience and I hope other players will take it up from here,” Toriola said. Meshref however lauded the records set by Toriola and Oshonaike, describing them as legends of the sport.
