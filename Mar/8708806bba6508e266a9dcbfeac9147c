The Ogun State Chairman, National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), Comrade Hakeem Bodunrin (Iyeru) has cautioned motorists and passengers across the state not to accept nose masks, gloves and sanitizers from untrusted sources. He made this passionate appeal while addressing newsmen in his Asero’s Office, Abeokuta, state capital, against the backdrop of novel coronavirus pandemic that spreading across the country. Bodunrin said that it was unhealthy and dangerous to accept nose masks, gloves and sanitizers from untrusted persons, noting that criminals can lace them with chloroform for evil purposes. “People need to be very careful and cautious of whom they collect nose masks, gloves and sanitizers from, especially our Motorists and Passengers, this period of the COVID-19 pandemic, criminals can lace them with chloroform for evil missions,” Bodunrin said He noted that after the innocent person had used the laced nose mask, he/she could fall into coma or experience convulsion and the criminals could kidnap, rape or even kill the victim. According to him “Some criminals can pretend they are from a Foundation or Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and so in this period of shortage of nose masks, gloves and sanitizers, they will start distributing free personal protective equipment to the unsuspecting public and if you are not smart, you will fall victim to their trap,” He added that apart from washing of hands with soap under running water, Bodunrin encouraged Motorists and Passengers to sanitize their brackets, watches and bangles after use, so as to avoid the risk of spreading the virus unconsciously. He implored both Motorists and Passengers to abide by the state Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun warnings, rules and regulations for not more that twenty persons in gathering, saying that “prevention is better than cure.” “We should be a law abiding citizen of the country, let us not spread the virus but prevent ourselves from being infected with COVID-19 pandemic, in fact, they say, prevention is better than cure, we should be endeavour to stay healthy at all time,” Bodunrin warned.
