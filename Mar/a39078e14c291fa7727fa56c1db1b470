AC Milan technical director Paolo Maldini and his son Daniel have tested positive for coronavirus, the club has announced. The legendary former defender and his 18-year-old son have been isolated for the past two weeks but were found to have contracted the disease this week and will remain in quarantine until they are cleared of the virus. Right winger Daniel who is currently playing for the Milan Under-19s, made his first-team debut earlier this season. Maldini, 51, is considered one of the greatest defenders of all time. He won five Champions Leagues with Milan and appeared in 647 matches.
