 Nigeria Football Supporters Club has disassociated itself from a so-called Authentic Nigeria football supporters Club saying that they are not part of the club nor recognised by President General, Dr Rafiu Ladipo. “Our name is Nigeria Football Supporters Club. We are not planning any launch. As prominent Nigerians have been calling us to confirm this situation. It is therefore important to clarify this that we have been around many decades ago and we still maintain our integrity,” Dr Ladipo said. According to a statement by NFSC signed by both the National Chairman Rev. Sam Ikpea and PRO, Hafeez Balogun, the cheering club however advised the general public not to fall prey to any group not recognised by the NSFC. “All related issues between our great club and the general public only come through the national Secretariat,” the statement concluded.
