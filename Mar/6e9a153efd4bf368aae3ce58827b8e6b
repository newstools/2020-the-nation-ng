 NOLLYWOOD actress Nkiru Umeh alias Ada Ugah on Wednesday recounted how her house, beauty complex, two cars and more were destroyed in Sunday’s explosions at Abule Ado, a Lagos suburb. Umeh whose beauty complex was unveiled two-years-ago, said she lost items worth N50m while wares within her cosmetic studio valued at N10million, were also destroyed. The actress said her Personal Assistant and one of her boys miraculously escaped through the fence but the boy sustained injury and was recovering. The actress said on her official Instagram account despite the losses, she was grateful to God that no one died in the disaster. She wrote: “This comes to let those that have been calling and sending messages to know that I am alive. It’s a miracle that my family lost no life. I was in the church with my husband and kids when the explosion happened. “I lost my house and my beauty complex with everything in it. No pin was saved and two cars too but I thank God for life. Material things can be replaced but no one can replace life. “My neighbors in the house all died. It was a huge disaster. I am still in shock but I’ll be fine. I remain grateful to God for life. “My beauty complex and my house were directly opposite Bethlehem Girls’ College and the explosion happened right in front of the school. Everything went down. I thank God for life.
