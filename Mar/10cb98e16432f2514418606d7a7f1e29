AN accredited journalist covering the United Nations headquarters in New York has tested positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19). Mr. Tal Mekel, Head of the Media Accreditation and Liaison Unit of the organisation, confirmed this in an email to UN correspondents on Wednesday night. “As you may have heard, an accredited journalist has tested positive for COVID-19. They are already free of symptoms and self-isolating. “We have been informed that the individual was last at UN Headquarters yesterday, March 12. “They attended the spokesperson’s noon briefing and spent time at the Delegates Lounge and in the press area on the third floor,” Mekel said without mentioning names. This is the second known case at the UN headquarters after a delegate from the Permanent Mission of Philippines tested positive for the virus on March 13.
