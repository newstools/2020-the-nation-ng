The resolution was sequel to the passage of a motion of urgent national Importance by Chairman of House committee on Finance, Rep. James Faleke. Faleke, while moving the short motion, which was well received by members, noted that the disease was affecting other countries as well. According to him, it will have an effect on the Appropriation passed by the House, adding that the federal government may not even be able to pay salariesâ€¦. Details shortly.
