Sanusi told NationSport that the coach was also instructed to report any development concerning his players to enable the secretariat take appropriate action. He said that apart from Rohr, the secretariat is equally in contact with the players, adding, “it may interest you to know that few days ago I spoke with the Ahmed Musa and few others and advised them to observe the relevant preventive measures against Coronavirus.  “This is the time of need and our players’ health is very important. This COVID-19 is no respecter of anybody.  Even we at the secretariat are taking preventive measures. Talking with them is to assure them that we care for them at this time of the pandemic. “This is the time to show love to everybody and not just the Eagles but all the national teams. Our Technical Department is doing great by giving the secretariat up to date information about our players and officials. I sincerely pray that this coronavirus will end soon so that normal football activities can resume worldwide,” he added.
