 OFFICIALS at the Global Distance Learning Centre, Abuja on Tuesday denied some candidates sitting for the 2020 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) access into the examination hall. They said that the candidates arrived late at the Computer-Based Test centre located at the Central Business District, opposite Federal Ministry of Finance. They were scheduled to take the examination between 7am and 9am. Over 10 of the candidates, who arrived the centre with their parents, were told that they would have to wait till the 2021 examination, after they were told they arrived late. Some parents of the candidates, however, explained that the CBT centre addresses on their examination slips were not clear, as they read: “Abuja, Minna, Suleja, Niger State” and other examination towns. The affected candidates and their parents crowded the gate when the Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Education, Sonny Echono and Registrar, Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, Prof. Is-haq Oloyede, visited the centre. The permanent secretary and JAMB registrar were at the centre to monitor the exercise.
