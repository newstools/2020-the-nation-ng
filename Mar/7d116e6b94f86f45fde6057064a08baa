       The Olympic flame for the 2020 Tokyo Games will be lit in a ceremony in Olympia today but spectators will be barred because of fears over coronavirus. After dozens of people tested positive for COVID-19 in the broader western Peloponnese, the Greek Olympic Committee has said the ceremony must be held without spectators. Up to 12,000 had been expected to make their way to Olympia, where the ancient Games were held. Only 100 accredited guests from the International Olympic Committee and the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee, compared to 700 originally, will be allowed to attend the ceremony. Meanwhile, the inaugural 12-team Fed Cup Finals have been postponed because of coronavirus. The event was scheduled to take place at the Laszlo Papp Arena in Budapest from 14 to 19 April. The ITF says it is committed to staging the Finals at a later date this year.
