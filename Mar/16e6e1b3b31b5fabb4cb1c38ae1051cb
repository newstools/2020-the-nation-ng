Anthony Joshua’s world heavyweight title fight against Kubrat Pulev on June 20 could be moved to July, says promoter Eddie Hearn. The 30-year-old Briton is due to defend his WBA, WBO and IBF belts at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. “We do have a potential date in July but, right now, we are hoping June 20 can remain the date,” Matchroom Boxing’s Hearn told Sky Sports. Bulgarian Pulev, 38, is the mandatory IBF challenger to take on Joshua. With the uncertainty around when the remaining games in domestic football will be completed because of the coronavirus outbreak, and the possibility the season could extend into the summer months, Hearn said he has had conversations with Tottenham to “make sure we’re all on the same page”. “We know we have the same strategy moving forward,” added Hearn. “Obviously the Premier League decision will play a big part in a number of sports. Plans to put new dates in place and that fight as well.” Hearn also confirmed that all Matchroom Boxing cards in March and April have now been postponed, following on from the British Boxing Board of Control’s decision to postpone all public boxing events under their jurisdiction, a decision the sport’s governing body will review again next month. Joshua won the WBA, WBO and IBF belts back with a unanimous points victory over Andy Ruiz Jr last December.
