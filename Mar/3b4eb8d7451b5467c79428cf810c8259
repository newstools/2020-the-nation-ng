I am equally aware of other interventionist programmes by down government agencies and the NYSC aimed at giving you access to credit facilities for self-employment” I urge to to utilize these opportunities to create a better future for yourselves. With the present scarcity of job openings, I strongly believe that empowering the youths through skills acquisition and entrepreneurship development is the surest way to reduce the current level of unemployment” The Governnor commended the Corps members for their contribution in the areas of healthcare delivery, education and social services which he noted will forever be cherished. “I salute your patriotic spirit and efforts during the service year.
