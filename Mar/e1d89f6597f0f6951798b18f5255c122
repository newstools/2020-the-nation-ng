The Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja on Monday is set to hear the appeal filed by the suspended national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole who is challenging his suspension by an Abuja High Court.  The Abuja High Court presided over by Justice Danlami Senchi had granted an order of interlocutory injunction stopping Comrade Oshiomhole from parading himself as the National Chairman of the APC pending the hearing and determination of the suit seeking to give effect to the suspension order slammed on him by his ward in Edo State.
