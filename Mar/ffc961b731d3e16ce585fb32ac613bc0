The decision to suspend legislative activities was reached at the Thursday’s plenary presided over by Speaker Funminiyi Afuye. The Ekiti State Government announced a 38-year-old indigene tested positive to COVID-19. According to the government, the confirmed case was suspected to have been infected while driving a 27-year-old American visiting Nigeria from Richmond, Virginia, USA in the company of his 31-year-old female caregiver. The Chairman House Committee on Health, Mrs. Teju Okunyiga, had Under Matter of Urgent Public Importance, informed the House of a reported case of COVID-19 in the state. Okunyiga then called for precautionary measures to contain the further spread of the diseases. Other members, who spoke on the matter, included the leader of the Government Business Gboyega Aribisogan, Mrs Yemisi Ayokunle, and Abiodun Fawekun. They suggested that aside the Assembly’s complex, public places like schools should be shut down atleast for now. Speaker Afuye said “Activities at the Ekiti House of Assembly is hereby suspended as suggested by members, until further notice when the tension about the dread Corona virus is doused.” He, however, allayed the fear of residents, saying though the COVID-19 is real, government was on top of the situation. He urged members to sensitise their constituents against social interaction, regular washing of hands and unnecessary hand shake among others that could cause the spread of the disease in Ekiti. The Assembly thereafter adjourned plenary sitting indefinitely.
