 Nigerian international Dennis Emmanuel has been rated the third most valuable players in Belgium with the striker now valued at 17 million Euros. The attacker whose brilliant performance earned him a contract extension with Club Brugge in the first half of the season has seen his market value skyrocket in the latest market value updates of players in the Belgian First Division A published on Transfer market website Transfermarkt. The Nigerian is behind KAA Gent’s Jonathan David (25m Euros) and teammate Krépin Diatta (21m Euros), allnigeriasoccer.com reports.  At the beginning of the 2019-2020 season in July, Dennis’ market value was 7.50 million Euros, meaning his price tag has more than doubled. Based on his new valuation, he would become the fifth costliest Nigerian player behind Wilfred Ndidi (45m Euros), Alex Iwobi (32m Euros), Samuel Chukwueze (30m Euros) and Victor Osimhen (30m Euros). Globally, he is ranked number 86 among center forwards and 73rd among players born in 1997. KV Kortrijk’s new kid on the block Terem Moffi now has an updated market value of 1.5 million euros, which is ten times the amount he cost when he arrived in Belgium two months ago.
