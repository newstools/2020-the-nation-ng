 Former Bayelsa State Governor Seriake Dickson has praised President Muhammadu Buhari for appointing Prof. Kemebradikumo Pondei as acting managing director of Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). Dickson, who described Pondei as hard working, urged him to use his experience to clean up NDDC for optimum performance. A statement yesterday by his media aide, Fidelis Soriwei, admonished Pondei to focus on failed policies, projects and wastages responsible for the commission’s failure. He enjoined him to collaborate with governors in the region to actualise the agency’s objectives. He said: “I congratulate Prof. Kemebradikumo Pondei for his well-deserved appointment as acting managing director of NDDC. I also laud President Muhammadu Buhari and Chief Godswill Akpabio for the appointment. “I call on Prof. Pondei to use his experience to sanitise NDDC. As a Bayelsan, Prof. Pondei is aware of the failed policies, projects and wastages which account for NDDC’s under-performance. I, therefore, urge him to work loyally with the minister, the governor and government of Bayelsa State, and other Niger Delta states, to reposition NDDC in achieving its desired objectives for the benefit of Bayelsa State and the region.”
