World Boxing Federation (WBF) bouts featuring Nigeria’s Rilwan “Real One” Oladosu and Rilwan “Baby Face” Babatunde respectively and an international challenge contest featuring Taiwo “Esepo” Agbaje will headline GOtv Boxing Night 21. This was announced in Lagos on Tuesday at a press conference addressed by Flykite Productions, the organisers. The event, billed for 12 April at the Indoor Sports of the National Stadium in Lagos, will stage six fights across weight divisions. The biggest of these is the WBF International title, which will see Oladosu, the West African Boxing Union (WABU) lightweight champion, fight Ghana’s Emmanuel Quartey. Next to it is the WBF Africa title, which will feature Babatunde, the WABU welterweight champion, and Tanzania’s Mkwalekwa Salehe. The event will also see the explosive Agbaje, national featherweight champion, test his mettle against Moses Dodzi of Ghana in an international challenge duel. Also billed for title action is Sadiq “Happy Boy” Adeleke, who will face Tunde Olojede in the national bantamweight title clash. The bout line-up is completed by two non-title duels in the light heavyweight lightweight categories. The former will Daniel “Big Shark” Emeka up against Segun “Success” Olanrewaju, while the former pairs GOtv Boxing NextGen Search graduates, Alaba “Elyblow” Omotola with Lateef Akintola. Speaking at the event, Jenkins Alumona, Managing Director of Flykite Promotions, noted that while the country celebrates international boxers of Nigerian descent, it is equally important to provide Nigerian boxers the opportunity to also become world champions.
