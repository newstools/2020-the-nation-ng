 Residents of Awe town, Awe local government area of Nasarawa state, have expressed mixed reactions following the banishment of the deposed Emir of Kano, Sanusi Lamido Sanusi to their community. Speaking separately to The Nation in Awe town, former commissioner for Information in the state, Alhaji Abdullahi Mustapha said much as he is happy for Awe to be chosen as the host community for the deposed emir, the conditions surrounding his stay is rather sour and unfortunate. “We received with mixed feelings to stay of our distinguished guest, Sanusi Lamido, following his deposition as the emir of Kano. We wished the circumstances of his visit and stay were different”. The former Nasarawa state spokesman said since Sanusi’s arrival in Awe town not much has changed as the residents are going about their normal businesses. In his remark, Mohammed Tafida, also a former special adviser on Solid Minerals, said though the situation that brought the deposed emir of Kano to Awe was sad, the residents are hoping that something good could still come out of it.
