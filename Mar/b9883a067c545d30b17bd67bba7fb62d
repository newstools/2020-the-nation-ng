The Lagos State Government will close down Adejobi Street in the Agege axis today until Thursday, from 6:00pm to 6:00am daily for the level crossing construction. Alternative routes provided for road users during the course of the construction will include: motorists plying Adejobi, Agege axis to be diverted to Fagba Crossing, Toyin Crossing and Ashade Underpass to access their desired destinations. Road users are advised to comply with the traffic directions to minimise inconvenience in movement. The closure has been slated at this time, to ensure that there is smooth and uninterrupted flow of work on the rail tracks. “Lagos State Government is hereby appealing to residents of the State, especially motorists that ply these corridors to bear with us, as the project is aimed at achieving a seamless multi-modal transport system that will meet the transportation needs of a larger population.”
