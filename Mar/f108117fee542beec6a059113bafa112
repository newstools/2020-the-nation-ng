RALPH HASENHUTTL has backed Premier League matches being staged behind closed doors in the wake of the coronavirus. The Southampton boss believes top-flight chiefs should take any measures necessary in an attempt for this term’s league programme to be completed. Asked how he would feel about matches being played without fans, Hasenhuttl said: “I think it’s for sure not the same sport if you want, when you play like that it feels more like a training game. “But if we can manage to end the league with playing behind closed doors then it would help I think for the competition, it’s important. “But in general I think the break that will come after this game is important. “All we have to do in the moment is to do everything possible to make sure that the virus is not spreading so quickly. This is the goal we all have. “And if it helps to play without supporters or anything else we have to do this and deal with it. “This is the most important thing at the moment, and everything else is not so interesting. “I think it’s normal that there are in the moment more important things around us to focus on than football, and then it’s not easy to put the focus back on the pitch if you need to. “The good thing is if you’re on the pitch and training you can forget everything else and maybe enjoy playing with the team, the atmosphere is good. “But when you step off the pitch everyone is looking for the newest information. You can follow the problems all over the world.
