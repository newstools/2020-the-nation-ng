The Lagos State Government has suspended the Easter edition of its Eko-City Farmers’ Market earlier slated for Sunday, 29th March at the Tafawa Balewa Square due to the Coronavirus. The Commissioner for Agriculture, Prince Gbolahan Lawal explained that the suspension was part of the measures the government adopted to halt the spread of the deadly disease in the state. Lawal stated that the suspension would be reviewed as the spread of the COVID-19 is controlled and halted, adding that the health and welfare of everybody associated with the organisation of the Eko-City Farmers’ Market remain top priority. “The spread of COVID-19 remains unclear and we can reassure everyone that the health and welfare of our farmers, consumers and, indeed, everybody associated with the market remains our priority. We will continue to follow the government’s advice to keep the situation under review and explore all options available to find ways of resuming the market when the conditions allow,” the Commissioner opined. The Eko-City Farmers’ Market is as an exceptional initiative aimed at providing a conducive, safe and well-structured environment where farmers can trade their produce directly to consumers at farm gate prices. It was designed as a monthly market to be hosted on the last Sunday of every month in order to create an inclusive platform that would address the diverse needs of people in different social strata as well as ensure food safety and traceability that meets with international standards.
