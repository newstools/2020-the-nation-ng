From Bisi Oladele, Ibadan  NIGERIAN Institution of Surveyors (NIS) in Oyo State has appealed to Governor Seyi Makinde to employ more qualified surveyors to prevent revenue loss. Chairman of NIS Prince Aderemi Kobiowu addressed reporters at the 2020 Global Surveyors Day, with the theme: ‘The Impact of Surveying Globally’. Kobiowu said: “The government has been losing revenue due to the dearth of surveyors in the local governments. This is because of the use of survey plans that might not be approved by the Office of the Surveyor-General for the building plan.  The government is generating revenue on each survey plan through the submission of record copy and verification of the plan. But there are not enough surveyors to do the work. “Surveying is the bedrock of any meaningful development of a land, but if there is dearth of surveyors, then there is a problem in our development projects.” The chairman said the association had been agitating for department of survey in the councils because they were closer to the grassroots. He added that only seven of the 33 councils had qualified surveyors. He identified access to land and credit facilities as some factors mitigating against ease of doing business, adding, however, that Certificate of Occupancy (CofO) was germane to both.
