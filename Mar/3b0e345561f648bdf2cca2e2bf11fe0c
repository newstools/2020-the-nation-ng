The existing 10-bed coronavirus Isolation centre for Adamawa State is to be enlarged to hold 18 beds. The centre, located at the Specialist Hospital in the state capital, Yola, is also to be fitted with monitors and given a full-geared ambulance. The Medical Director of the Specialist Hospital, Dr Dauda Wadinga, who disclosed this to newsmen, explained that some vacant rooms at the centre would be duly equipped as part of heightened preparation against coronavirus. The centre in question, which is a two-storey structure, currently has just the ground floor being used as the emergency response centre in case Adamawa State experiences an outbreak of the deadly virus. The state currently has no case under observation and things are pretty normal with regard to the new health challenge, according to the state Director of Public Health Emergencies, Dr Bwalki Dilli. Dr Bwalki told our correspondent on Friday that the state was without any case of coronavirus but would continue its sensitization campaign to protect the people. Earlier in the week, Governor Ahmadu Fintiri had assured during an assessment of the coronavirus isolation centre, that the state was prepared for emergencies regarding the virus. “We are well prepared to tackle any case of COVID 19. This facility is fully equipped to that effect,” the governor told journalists after a tour of the centre conducted with him by the state Commissioner of Health, Prof. Abdullahi Isa, and the Specialist Hospital MD, Dauda Wadinga. The governor said the Ministry of Health on its part was enlightening the general public on measures to be taken against the virus.
