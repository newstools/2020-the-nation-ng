 Chelsea winger Callum Hudson-Odoi has tested positive for coronavirus. The Blues’ training ground has been partially closed, while players and staff who have had close contact with the England international will now self-isolate, the club said in a statement. This will initially include the entire Chelsea men’s first team squad, coaching team and several backroom staff. The club statement added: “Callum displayed symptoms similar to a mild cold on Monday morning and has not been at the training ground since then as a precaution. “However, his test came in positive this evening and he will undergo a period of self-isolation. Despite testing positive for the virus, Callum is doing well and looking forward to returning to the training ground as soon as it is possible.” The news came hours after Arsenal confirmed head coach Mikel Arteta had also been diagnosed with coronavirus. The Gunners’ match against Brighton on Saturday has since been postponed. The Premier League has yet to announce whether Chelsea’s game with Aston Villa the same day will also be called off. An emergency meeting will now take place between the Premier League and top-flight clubs on Friday, with a strong possibility that the season will be suspended. (Independent UK)
