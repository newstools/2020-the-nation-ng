 LAGOS State Environmental Protection Agency (LASEPA) and Lagos State Safety Commission (LSSC) on Monday sealed three churches for contravening the government’s social distancing order. The churches are New Height Assembly Parish of Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) at Oluwole Saabo in Ojodu Abiodun; Christ Virtues Restoration Word International at 2, Surulere Street, near Oniwaya Road at Dopemu; and Fire Pentecostal Ministry International at 27/29 Okeho Street, Pako Bus Stop, Off Abeokuta Expressway in Dopemu. LASEPA’s General Manager Dolapo Fasawe hailed the level of compliance in other churches visited at Omole, Mushin, Ikorodu, Oshodi, Ipaja, Surulere, among others. According to her, the churches in those areas instructed their members to join their church services online. “Mosques visited on Friday too complied with the directive. Those visited included Alhamdiyya on Lagos-Abeokuta Expressway, Alimosho Central Mosque, Iyana-Ipaja, and Ansar-Ud-Ddeen Mosque, Ipaja, among others…“ she said. She called on Lagos residents to obey directives of government and act in the best interest of the public. According to her, the sensitisation and monitoring carried out between Saturday night and the early hours of Sunday in some entertainment centres and churchess showed high level of compliance. The general manager praised Lekki-Ajah residents for the closure of non-essential stores, including clubs and other entertainment facilities. She attributed the compliance to awareness campaigns embarked upon by the agency and the informed level of residents. Fasawe stressed that an earlier enforcement exercise by the agencies reawakened the consciousness of residents to the seriousness of limiting the spread of the virus by the state.
