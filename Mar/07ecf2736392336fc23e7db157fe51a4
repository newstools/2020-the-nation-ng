 THE Lagos West Baptist Conference has suspended services in all its affiliate churches. The move, according to its President, Rev (Dr) Sam Oladiran, in a memo to church leaders, was to comply with Lagos State Government directive and ensure safety of worshippers during the coronavirus pandemic. “We appeal to our churches to please close down the building for seven days. We need to do this for the safety of our members,” Oladiran said. He urged churches to utilise the house fellowship centres for services with five families, not exceeding 20 members meeting in selected centres.
