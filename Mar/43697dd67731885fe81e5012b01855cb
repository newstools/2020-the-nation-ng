 The Conservator-General, National Park Service (NPS), Ibrahim Goni, has advised Nigerians to stop eating bush meat. He said people should rely more on alternative source of animal protein such as animal husbandry, fishery, rabbitry and others to help improve on the wildlife population. He spoke at the weekend during the celebration of World Wildlife Day 2020, which had: ‘Sustaining all Life on Earth’as theme in Abuja. Goni said less  of bush meat consumption would eliminate the threat of extinction posed on the endangered wildlife species in the natural ecosystems.  He said the focus should be on adopting sustainable ways of ensuring conservation for the country’s wildlife species such that the present generation to the natural heritage of wildlife resources does not jeopardise the access of the future generation to the same resources. He said this aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1,12, 14 and 15, which  include wide-ranging commitments on alleviating poverty, ensuring sustainable use of natural resources and conserving life on land and in water to halt biodiversity loss for human generation well-being. Goni urged the government to consider polices that are environmentally friendly and capable of reducing environmental degradation as well as encourage sustainable utilisation and conservation of the wild fauna and flora heritage for interrogational equity and perpetuation of life on earth.
