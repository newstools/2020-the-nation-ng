OFFICIALS in the United States’ hardest hit areas are warning of major shortages of critical medical supplies as the virus continues to spread through all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Total confirmed cases in the US have risen to 24,747 with at least 340 deaths. Speaking on CNN yesterday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said his city is 10 days away from seeing “widespread shortages” of supplies. “If we don’t get more ventilators… people will die who don’t have to die,” de Blasio said. “This is going to be the greatest crisis, domestically, since the great depression.” New York state has been ravaged by the virus in recent days, home to more than 10,000 confirmed cases – almost half the country’s total. U.S. lawmakers will meet today to discuss a massive emergency aid package to help soften the economic impact of the outbreak – expected to top $1 trillion.
