 THREE hours after the three tiers of government went in for the monthly Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) meeting, they all came out without agreeing on what to share for last month. Director, Press, Federal Ministry of Finance Mr. Hassan Dodo simply told reporters that the meeting was inconclusive without giving details. However, a FAAC member who refused to be named confirmed that the meeting was deadlocked between the federal and state governments who are the heavy weights at the meeting. Another source told The Nation to “cast your mind back to the source of past disagreements at FAAC”. What this means is that there wasn’t enough to be shared because a revenue-generating agency did not remit fully into Federation Account. In what has become the tradition, the source disclosed that a new date will be fixed for the continuation of the FAAC meeting after the National Economic Council (NEC) meeting scheduled for the Presidential Villa today. There was no indication that there was anything untoward as the FAAC members gathered for the meeting. However after three hours of deliberations the members were seen filing out of the auditorium of the Federal Ministry of Finance venue of the meeting. Last month, the meeting ended with the news that the Excess Crude Account (ECA) had been seriously depleted to $71 million. Also within the month it was disclosed that about 50 crude oil bearing tankers were stranded at sea because of the Coronavirus pandemic. The Federal Government has hinted that it will review the 2020 budget parameters to accommodate the difficult realities brought on the world economies by the scourge of Coronavirus. If the deadlock persists beyond this week, civil servants across the country may have to wait longer to get their March 2020 salaries.
