Forgoing her enormously busy schedule as a 23-Grand Slam-winning tennis icon, fashion designer and serial entrepreneur, Serena Williams, shared her decision of only being with her husband Alexis Ohanian and 2-year-old daughter Olympia during the coronavirus outbreak. “Spending the next 6 weeks in solitude. Being a wife. Being a mom. Cooking. Cleaning. Spring cleaning,” Williams said in an Instagram video. “Face mask. Makeup tutorials. I’ll let you know how it goes…. stay safe everyone. This is serious.” In January, Williams participated in the 2020 Australian Open and also the Fed Cup a month later. The Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) has the upcoming Miami Open and the Volvo Car Open in Charleston, South Carolina, CBS Sports reports.
