 FOR allegedly providing misleading information to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, the anti-graft agency has charged one Idongesit Eyibo before a federal court in Uyo the Akwa Ibom State capital. Eyibo participated in the 2013 Lottery competition organised by the Papi Events and Promotion Limited in conjunction with the state government. The lottery competition was part of the activities to commemorate the Silver Jubilee Celebration of the state. Eyiboh reportedly won about eight houses at the  competition. But the EFCC is claiming that he provided  false information to the Commission, an act punishable under section 39(2)(b) of the Commission’s Act,2004. The charge with registration number FHC/Uyo/109c/2019  was signed on behalf of the Commission by Adebayo Soares, a lawyer. The charge read: “That you Idongesit Eyibo ‘M’ on or about the 24th day of July, 2019 at Uyo within the jurisdiction of this honorable court, did make a statement to officers of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission via a written petition addressed to the office of the said Commission which to your knowledge was intended to mislead the officers of the Commission in investigating the petition and thereby committed an offence contrary to section 39(2)(a) of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission Establishment Act 2004 and punishable under section 39(2)(b) of the same act.” But upon preliminary investigation, the Commission perceived  the transaction to be a purely civil and commercial transactions rather than criminal and worthy of investigation. The case was adjourned till March, 26, 2020.
