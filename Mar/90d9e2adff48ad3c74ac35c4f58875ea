Following the suspension of all football activities for four weeks by the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) due to COVID-’19 which has been declared by WHO as pandemic, the head of NFF Technical Department Bitrus Bewarang has stated that the national women U-20 Team just released from camp will be closely monitored as the postponed qualifier may be reschedule any time soon by CAF. Bewarang who made this known yesterday, said the 25 players have been directed to drop their addresses with the team Secretary and also the technical crew to assist the federation in monitoring the players. “You know the Falconets would have played Burkina Faso in this weekend’s first leg, FIFA U20 World Cup, Africa Zone qualifier but due to COVID-19, CAF postponed all qualification matches as a precautionary measure against COVID-19 spread. “Also we can’t keep them in camp indefinitely without a date and couple with the directive of the NFF to put on hold all football activities for now as we watch development globally. Like I told you previously we want all our national teams to qualify for all FIFA/CAF organised championships. “We have equally advise them to train on their own in order to keep fit so that we won’t start all over again when they return to camp. You know players like enjoyment especially when they are not in any competition.  We must ensure we keep tabs on them. He also said that the technical crew have been advised not to relax but to be in close contact with the players. Costa Rica and Panama is to host of this year’s FIFA U20 Women’s World Cup initially scheduled for August.
