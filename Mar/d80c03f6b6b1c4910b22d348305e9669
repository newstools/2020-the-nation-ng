57. Aminu Ado Bayero (2020….)   THE historic deposition of monarchs in Nigeria underscored the tension between the Republican order and monarchy. It even started from the colonial days when the British administration brooked no opposition. A classic case was the deposition of King Dosunmu, who relocated to Epe before he later regained the throne of Oba of Lagos. Also in Lagos, Oba Matiku Olusi was asked to step down as ruler to permit Oba Eleko Esugbayi to regain the throne. When Esugbayi died barely two years later, the conspiracy of prominent Lagosians led to the emergence of Oba Falolu. The turn of events upset Olusi, who many people believed was short-changed. Tragedy befell more monarchs on the throne, owing largely to personal errors and punishment by the government of the day. Some of them adjusted to life outside the palace. An example was an ex-Olota of Ota, a car dealer who returned to his business in Lagos.  Alaaye of Efon-Alaaye  A popular and progressive ruler, Oba Samuel Adeniran Atewogboye 11(Kekereata Asusumasa Okorobi’gberesi), Alaaye of Efon Kingdom, ascended the throne in 1936. He and his aides were arrested, tried and sentenced for the murder of a child, Princess Adediwura, around 1949. The young lawyers, Obafemi Awolowo, Bode Thomas and Arthur Prest, defended the accused, but without success. The monarch was imprisoned. Other sources said he was electrocuted. The sad incident drew the curtains on his reign.  Alaafin of Oyo  Oba Adeniran Adeyemi, son of Alaafin Alowolodu and father of Oba Lamidi Adeyemi, was deposed by the old Western Regional Government headed by Chief Awolowo in 1953. The deposition followed the rift between Alhaji Adeyemi, a councillor and sympathiser of the National Council of Nigerian Citizens (NCNC), and the highly pompous Bode Thomas, who was Action Group (AG) chairman of Oyo District Council. Thomas died mysteriously and the monarch bore the burden of the controversy. He and his Aremo were banished to Osogbo, and later Ijora, Lagos. His exit from the ancient palace paved the way for the ascension of Alayeluwa Bello Gbadegesin Ladigbolu 11.  Alake of Egbaland  The Alake of Egbaland, Oba Ladapo Ademola, who ruled between 1920 and 1962, was exiled between 1948 and 1948, following the popular women uprising against taxation, led by Mrs. Funmilayo Ransom-Kuti. He was accommodated in Akure by the Deji, Oba Afunbiowo Adesida. However, Oba Ademola regained his throne.  Emir Sanusi 1 of Kano  Alhaji Muhammadu Sanusi was number three in order importance or hierarchy in the old Northern Region, trailing behind Sultan Abubakar Sodiq and Shehu of Borno, Alhaji El-Kanemi. But, according to historians, he was more popular. As the region was on the fast lane to self-rule, eyes were on him as the likely Governor. But, crisis broke out between the highly esteemed Emir of Kano and the Premier, Sir Ahmadu  Bello, Sardauna of Sokoto. The Premier by-passed him. Instead, former House of Representatives member Sir Hassan Kashim from Borno was appointed. In 1963, following the deep-seated crisis, the emir was removed and banished to Azare in present-day Bauchi State. As his grandson suffered the same fate on Monday, history repeated itself. Sanusi 1 died in 2002.  Attah of Ebiraland  Alhaji Ibrahim Attah was the ruler of Ebiraland. He was a very wise and clever ruler. He invested many resources in the education of his children, who were numerous. They include former Governor Adamu Attah of Kwara State, former Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Finance, Abdulaziz Attah, and the Ohinoyi, Alhaji Ado Ibrahim. He was deposed in the sixties and banished, never to regain his throne. Knowing that he will not return, he charged his son to be united and defend his legacies.  Ewi of Ado-Ekiti  The young, dynamic and first educated Ewi of Ado-Ekiti, Oba Anirare Aladesanmi, had to temporarily vacate the stool, following protests by townspeople against his policies. As people gathered in annoyance outside the ancient palace, his brave supporters courageously spirited him out. He was hosted by Deji Adesida I of Akure. His brother, Adeyemo Aladesanmi, was made ruler by some aggrieved people. But, Oba Anirare Aladesanmi bounced back, having normalised his relations with his subjects and the colonial resident. On his arrival, his brother became an interloper. He was asked to vacate the throne. In later years, Oba Anirare Aladesanmi served as the Chancellor of the University of Maiduguri, Maiduguri.  Olowo of Owo  The legendary Olowo of Owo, Oba Olateru Olagbegi was enveloped in the web of politics. He was a partner in progress with Chief Adekunle Ajasin as Owo hosted the birth of AG. But, they parted ways, following the split in the AG as a result of the protracted feud between Awolowo and Premier Ladoke Akintola. Owo was engulfed in crisis and violence of monumental proportion. Oba Olagbegi was suspended, and later, deposed by the military government of Western State. His cousin, Adekola Ogunoye, became the new Olowo. But, after his demise, Sir Olagbegi regained his lost throne. His family was grateful to former Ondo State Governor Bamidele Olumilua.  Zarki of Arigidi  The Zarki of Arigidi-Akoko, Oba Olanipekun, was a minister without portfolio under the Akintola government. The rift between the AG and the Nigeria National Democratic Party (NNDP) polarised his town. The monarch was alleged to have taken sides with a political tendency. His people revolted. Alhaji Olanipekun embarked on exile. But, 25 years later, he returned to his throne.  Odemo of Isara  The nationalist politician, Oba Samuel Akinsanya, was naturally a sympathiser of the AG, a fact that infuriated his former colleague in the Nigerian Youth Movement (NYM), Premier Akintola. He could not be deposed because he enjoyed the support of his subjects. But, Akintola reduced his total salary package to one kobo per annum. However, the Aseyin of Iseyin, Oba Raji Adebowale, was not lucky. He was deposed by the Akintola government because of his sympathy for AG. As his supporters were wailing as he was being taken out of the town by security agents, he urged them to get their voter cards ready to vote for AG in 1965 Western Regional parliamentary elections.  Awujale of Ijebuland  The Second Republic Ogun State government of Olabisi Onabanjo jolted the people of Ijebuland when it announced the deposition of the Awujale, Oba Sikiru Adetona. But, the order was futile. The court said the announcement was made in error. The Awujale never suffered any reverse of royal fortune.  Ooni of Ife and Emir of Kano  For travelling out of the country to Israel without permission, the late Ooni of Ife Oba Okunade Sijuwade and the late Emir of Kano Alhaji Ado Bayero were restricted to their respective palaces for six months by the Buhari/Idiagbon military regime. They lost their freedom of movement and wider freedom of association and assembly.  Sultan of Sokoto  Alhaji Ibrahim Dasuki succeeded Sultan Abubakar Sodiq of Sokoto. However, crisis broke out between him and the maximum ruler, the late Gen. Sani Abacha, who left the gift presented to him by the monarch at the airport in Sokoto during his visit to the Caliphate. Following his removal, Alhaji Maccindo became Sultan.  Emir of Gwandu  The promising Amry Officer and Aide-de-Camp to former military President Ibrahim Babangida, Major Mustafa Jokolo, was deposed by the Kebbi State government as Emir of Gwandu in 2005 and banished to Loko, a Fulani town in Nasarawa State.  Deji of Akure  Oba Adepoju Adesina succeeded Oba Adebobajo Adesida as Deji of Akure. He was from the Osupa Ruling House. Following his unruly behaviours, which ridiculed the throne, he was dethroned by the Ondo State government. He made a spirited attempt to stage a comeback, following the demise of his successor, Oba Adebiyi Adesida. But, the public mood did not support his second coming. Oba Aladetoyinbo from the Osupa Ruling House was crowned in succession to Oba Adesida.  Olugbo of Ugboland  For five years, Oba Mafimisebi held forte as the Olugbo of Ugboland. But, following the court ruling affirming Oba Fredrick Akinruntan as the rightful choice, Mafimisebi had to vacate the throne. The same fate has befallen the Eleruwa of Eruwa after 10 years on the throne.
