Amid the furore trailing local government administration in Oyo State, Governor Seyi Makinde said on Wednesday that the names of members of the local government caretaker committee would soon be announced. He said the government is only awaiting approval of the House of Assembly. The governor addressed party leaders, elders and members during a stakeholders’ meeting held at the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)  secretariat, Molete, Ibadan. The meeting was attended by top government functionaries, party leaders from the six geopolitical zones, local government and ward chairmen, elders, political office holders, members of the House of Assembly led by Speaker Adebo Ogundoyin, executive council members of the party, youth groups, women groups, among others. Replying the requests made earlier by representatives from the zones, Makinde called for peace among party members, noting that the ruling party would uphold the coalition agreement with other parties that birthed his administration. “We are still with our agreement on the coalition that birthed this government. You will see the likes of Barrister Bayo Lawal and other people who contested on different political platforms at the meeting today. So, it may look like it is slow, but surely, we are getting somewhere. “We are trying to carry everybody along, but politics is a game of give and take. Sometimes, what you are looking for you can’t get it, but what you get; you try to make something out of it. “We are in a phase where governance should take the forefront in whatever it is that we are doing. And the party leaders and elders out there have done really well, but we need to do more to enlighten the ordinary party members on the need for all of us to work together. “Peace is important in the party and we have told the party leaders to continue to talk to the members at all levels that where there is cooperation that is where growth resides,” he said.
