 Did Hafusat Ibuloye kill herself and her 15-year-old daughter Aduke to spite her husband for abandoning them? Ibuloye, an Idumota, Lagos Island resident, allegedly woke Aduke up in the wee hours of penultimate Thursday and gave her a cup laced with sniper to drink. She was said to have done same to her two younger children but those ones refused the drink. While Aduke, a hairdressing apprentice died before dawn, her mother, a cleaner with an insurance firm, drank hers afterwards and was found unconscious by neighbours who rushed to the hospital where she died. According to sources, the woman was bitter that her husband had not reached out to her, many years after he allegedly relocated to the United States of America (USA). It was learnt that Hafusat’s frustration increased after she got information her estranged husband had returned from the USA about three months ago but never looked for them She was said to have bought sniper insecticide on credit from a nearby shop and told the seller that her family would pay later. The Nation gathered that a day before the suicide, Hafusat visited the woman who raised her, said some emotional prayers which prompted the aged woman to ask why she was praying in such a manner. “It was the old woman that raised her because she’s an orphan. So, the woman is her mother. The day she visited and said some prayers, the woman was disturbed and asked why she was praying like that. She said it was because she has not seen her in a while. “Then, on her way home, she bought sniper. Around 1am, on Thursday, she woke Aduke from sleep as well as her younger brothers. “She gave them something to drink but the two boys said they did not want and returned to sleep. She then woke them up, took them to their uncle’s house that was nearby and told the man she wanted to do something in the house. “She came back woke Aduke and handed the cup to her. She just drank it and went back to sleep again. That was how she died.”
