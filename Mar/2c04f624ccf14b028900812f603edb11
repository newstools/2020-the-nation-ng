Despite skepticism over the move from some Ighalo has had a promising start at Old Trafford, scoring three goals in his opening six games.  “I know many footballers say that, when they sign for a team, this is my dream team,” Ighalo said in an interview with SkySports. “Respect to that but my own case was different. “Anyone who knows me back from when I was young knows I and my siblings supported Man United, we would pay to go and watch Man United play. “In Nigeria, you have to have sports channels to watch that but not everyone can afford it. My parents couldn’t afford that so you have to pay a viewing centre to watch that. We would pay to watch that. “You start saving the money they would give you to go to school. You would eat at home and they would give you some pocket money to go to school and maybe eat lunch there. But you would be saving it bit by bit and when you get to the weekend, everybody is ready.”
