 Grammy-nominated artist, Burna Boy on Sunday was honored with a gold plaque for his 2018 single on the low in France. The gold plaque is for selling 100,000 (or more) copies of the single. A gold plaque could also be handed to an artist whose single has been streamed 15 million times in the country. Thus, 15 million streams of a single in France is equivalent to 100,000 pure sales. Burna Boy released On The Low on November 16, 2018; the second single off Burna Boy’s 7th studio album, African Giant. Burna boys on the low hit 50 million Spotify streams 12 days after it hit over 100 million YouTube views. The singer was accompanied by his mother and manager, Bose Ogulu also known as Mama Burna. In an Instagram post to celebrate the win, Burna Boy wrote: “On The Low went Gold in France without any radio push or promo. Love every single one of you that streamed it over 15m times, it’s still #FOOTONNECK2020.”
