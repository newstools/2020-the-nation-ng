 Last week was all about the marriage ceremony of first son of former Ogun State Governor, Otunba Gbenga Daniel. The classy introduction/engagement took place on Thursday, March 5, while the grand reception took place on Saturday, March 6, at Queens Park Event Centre, Victoria Island, Lagos. When a ‘fake bride’ was presented to Daniel’s wife, Yeye Olufunke Daniel, during the engagement ceremony, she didn’t think twice before she knew. Without unveiling the ‘fake bride’, she replied that it was not her daughter-in-law. The former Ogun State First Lady couldn’t hide her joy seeing her son, Olurotimi, taking the bold step to spend forever with Nafisat Mahmud.
