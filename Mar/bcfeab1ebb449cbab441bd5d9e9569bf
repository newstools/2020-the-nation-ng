TYSON Fury insists he is still the rightful owner of Anthony Joshua’s heavyweight title belts as he eyes two more fights before considering hanging up his gloves. Fury became heavyweight world champion for the second time when he demolished Deontay Wilder to claim his WBC belt in Las Vegas on February 22. Whilst there were instant calls for a fight with Anthony Joshua to become undisputed king of the most lucrative division, Wilder has activated his rematch clause for a trilogy fight. The pair is set to do battle for a third time in Las Vegas in July whilst Joshua will defend his belts against IBF mandatory challenger Kubrat Pulev at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on June 20. Appearing yesterday on ITV’s This Morning, Fury suggested he sees himself taking on Wilder then Joshua before hanging up the gloves. And he aimed a dig at Joshua by claiming he is still the rightful owner of his WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO belts, which he won in sensational fashion from Wladimir Klitschko in 2015 before three years out of the sport battling mental health issues.
