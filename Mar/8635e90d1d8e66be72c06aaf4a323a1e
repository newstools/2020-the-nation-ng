 The Federal Government and oil marketers are yet to resolve issues around the reduction of pump price of premium motor spirit (petrol) from N145 per litre to N125 per litre, The Nation has learnt. The government through the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA) met with Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN) and Depot and Petroleum Products Marketers Association of Nigeria (DAPPMAN) last Thursday and reached an agreement to look at the issues of fuel importation and review of retail margins of marketers.  At the meeting, PPPRA, whose responsibility it is to determine the pricing template and appropriate price band for the marketers, was mandated to have a board meeting on Friday last week to straighten out the modalities to enable the marketers adjust their pumps to the new price. The Nation, however, gathered that as at yesterday, the PPPRA has not communicated to the marketers the outcome of its board meeting, hence many filling stations are yet to comply with adjustment to the new price. To avoid being punished by the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) for selling above N125 per litre, some of the marketers including dealer-owned NNPC filling stations, have chosen to shut down their retail outlets, claiming they donâ€™t have fuel, a ploy to await government decision on increasing their margins. It was further learnt that PPPRA has scheduled another meeting for March 27 to continue deliberation on the matter.
