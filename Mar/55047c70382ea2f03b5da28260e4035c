Ex-Super Eagles star, Jay-Jay Okocha’s name still opens doors for him. Despite retiring from active football years ago, he is still loved my many for the magic he did with the ball while wearing the national team’s jersey. The soccer legend recently partied with Macallan Single Malt Scotch Whisky at Porsche Centre, Victoria Island, Lagos, where he enjoyed an evening of fine dining and whisky pairing. Nigeria’s Macallan Brand Ambassador, Motunrayo Abiona, was a perfect host. She ensured that the three-course meal was carefully paired with different expressions of Macallan Single Malt Scotch Whisky. The event began with red-carpet appearances, followed by Macallan signature cocktails and networking in a custom designed pop-up space. Later, guests were led to the main area for dinner.
