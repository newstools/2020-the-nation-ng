 AS part of events to mark the International Women’s Day, women Keke (commercial tricycle) riders in Lagos have been trained in safety and tricycle maintenance. They participated in the Queen Riders’ programme established to teach women from under-represented backgrounds how to safely ride and repair tricycles. The programme is a flagship Corporate Social Responsibility initiative of Simba TVS. It is designed to enable women partake in the industry and increase their families’ disposable incomes. The founder of the Five Cowries Initiative, Polly Alakija; Nollywood actress, Chioma Akpotha; Fobims Ventures Limited Proprietor Mrs. Olubunmi Kuforiji (aka Mama Keke) and Cedar Microfinance Bank Managing Director Mrs. Gloria Olayiwola were among the facilitators. As part of the event, the Queen Riders Programme graduates and dignitaries painted the tricycles under the guidance of Alakija and her assistants, using art to encourage the expression of creativity. The firm said: “Women’s empowerment is a key focus of the Simba Group. The Queen Rider’s Programme is a key platform for achieving their vision of enriching lives of Nigerians. “The programme was born from the group’s desire to train women from underrepresented backgrounds so that they have a chance to increase their total family income. “The Simba Training School, which also conducts advanced mechanic courses, has provided training to these riders free of cost. “Training like this is regularly conducted by Simba TVS across the country and several of these Queen Riders are not only driving Kekes, but some have become fleet owners operating tricycles. “After the women are trained and certified, they have the option to be put in contact with various tricycle fleet owners and microfinance institutions so that they have a better chance of availing these micro-entrepreneurship opportunities.”
