Justice Hakeem Oshodi of an Ikeja High Courton Friday told suspected billionaire kidnap kingpin, Chukwudimeme Onwuamadike a.k.a Evans to be prepared to defend himself. Justice Oshodi expressed dismay that Evans again and for the third time, failed to have legal representation. “It is either you get the service of a lawyer or be prepared defend yourself”, the judge warned Evans Friday. Evans however told the court that his people are still making efforts to secure the service of a new lawyer for him. Evans is being prosecuted along with Uche Amadi, Okechukwu Nwachukwu, Chilaka Ifeanyi, Victor Chukwunonso Aduba and Ogechi Uchechukwu on two count charge of conspiracy and kidnapping. The prosecution also accused Evans and others of kidnapping Mr. Sylvanus Ahamonu and holding him hostage for at least nine weeks and collecting a ransom to the tune of USD 420,000 from his family. He is also facing trial before two other courts for similar kidnapping charges. When the matter came up for hearing yesterday, Evans had no legal representation. Lawyers who announced their appearances for other defendants include Chris Obiaka for the 2nd and 3rd defendants, Mr. O. Aja, for 4th defendant while A.A Uzouku and Emmanuel Ochai appeared for 5th and 6th defendants respectively. Justice Oshodi who was disturbed by the development warned Evans, who had changed counsel on three occasions that he will be compelled to enter defence for himself if he is not represented during the next hearing. “It is on record that the first defendant has changed counsel three times “If by the next hearing, the first defendant is not represented, he will be allowed to conduct proceedings on his own, this is a warning,” the judge ruled. Justice Oshodi adjourned the case to April 3, 2020 for ruling on the no-case submission filed by other defendants.
