Former Nigeria international Victor Moses has been given permission to return to England amid the Coronavirus pandemic. The online edition of La Gazzetta dello Sport has reported that the Chelsea-owned winger was given the go-ahead to travel to England on Tuesday to be with his family following the end of the self-isolation taken after Juventus defender Daniele Rugani tested positive for the virus. Romelu Lukaku, Ashley Young, Diego Godin, Christian Eriksen, Brozovic and Handanovic are the other non-Italian players on the Inter Milan roster who have returned to their respective countries. With a view to the resumption of the Italian Serie A, Moses will follow a training regime delivered to him by Interâ€™s fitness coaches before he left Milan. The 2013 Africa Cup of Nations winner was recovering from a thigh problem before the league was postponed. Moses has appeared in seven matches for Inter Milan since his loan move in January, logging 359 minutes.
