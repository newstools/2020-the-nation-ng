Police and local security outfits have launched a manhunt for a man said to be in his 30s, who reportedly defiled a three-year-old girl in Adamawa State and fled. Residents of Gera Bonyo, a community in Girei Local Government Area of Central Adamawa Zone where the incident took place, said on Sunday that vigilantes and hunters were searching for the man, while the state police spokesman, DSP Suleiman Nguroje said his men were also looking for the suspect. Our correspondent learnt that the suspect, Adili Dan Alaji, had on  March 10, pounced on the three-year-old girl, and fled when the girl cried out in agony. He had inflicted third-degree injuries on the child, according to sources at the Federal Medical Centre Yola where she was receiving medical attention. It was learnt yesterday that the suspect was an errand boy in the house of the child’s father, and used the opportunity of his closeness to the family to sexually assault the daughter of his master. The father of the minor, who was initially “reluctant” to bring the perpetuator to justice for fear exposing the family to negative publicity, is said to have yielded to pressure and is in support of tracing the runaway suspect. Police spokesman DSP Suleiman Nguroje said the case was reported and necessary steps were being taken to address it. Nguruje said told our  correspondent, “The matter was reported to the police. We are going after the suspect, because he escaped immediately after the act. But our men are doing everything possible to apprehend him.”
