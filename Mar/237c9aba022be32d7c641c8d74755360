 President Muhammadu Buhari said on Friday that the challenges facing Nigeria are higher than its  national income. He said such challenges including  insecurity, absence of critical infrastructure, poverty and unemployment , must be overcome for the country  to make progress. President Buhari stated this at the National Policy and Development Summit held in Abuja. Represented by the Permanent Secretary, Office of the Secretary to the Government  of the Federation, Mr. Andrew David, Buhari  said: “Although, as a government, we have been striving to prioritize and balance between the welfare of Nigerians and infrastructural needs of the country. This we have been doing through pragmatism that enables our government to simultaneously concentrate on social investment and infrastructure provisioning. “The Reports of the Monthly Policy Dialogue Series is hereby acknowledged, especially the one that dealt succinctly on funding the Next Level Agenda. The challenges and prospects as documented are well noted. This will further enable government to tackle funding challenges as highlighted by stakeholders at the Dialogue. “We appreciate the contribution of Hon. Ibrahim Bapetel and his hard working team to the governance process. Their contributions have assisted in a much significant way to rejigging retreat for government ministers. “The retreat now includes training, deliverables and targets amongst others. This is one of the major milestones the first summit that interrogated the change Agenda achieved. “Today, as a result of the recommendation of the summit, the opaque nature of the NNPC as noted by the report of the first summit is being gradually overcome. We now have an NNPC that is declaring profit and has also gone ahead to collaborate with the National Assembly to enact the Deep Shore Act 2019 that gives us more leverage over our oil resources. It is the first of its kind in our recent history.”
