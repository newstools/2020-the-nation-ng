The House of Representatives wants tank farms located in residential areas across Lagos State removed with immediate effect. It will work with relevant stakeholders to settle the issue for the satisfaction of the affected communities. The House also asked the Comptroller General of the Customs to immediately reverse the ban on the use of barges for evacuating containers and other cargoes, to and from the ports in Lagos. The resolution came on the heels of two separate motions sponsored by Oghene Egoh and Leke Abejide. Egoh informed the House that over 50 oil tank farms were located in ljegun, Kirikiri, Satellite town, and old Ojo roads, which serves as residential areas in Amuwo Odofin, Federal Constituency of Lagos State. He expressed concern that if any of the tank farms should explode in those residential areas, thousands of people would be killed and many properties destroyed. According to him,Â  it is always extremely difficult to move easily in those areas as tank farms block access in the residential areas. He said they cause avoidable delays and pose serious harm to the people. He said journes of five minutes now take over two hours to complete due to the tank farms.
