 THE mother of a 12-year-old boy pictured with blood streaming down his face will be prosecuted today, the Director, Lagos State Directorate of Citizens’ Rights (DCR), Mrs Biola Oseni has said. The bloodied boy’s picture went viral on social media, drawing attention from various individuals and organisations. Mrs Oseni said the state government, through the DCR, has rescued the boy  from their Agege, Lagos residence. The boy was seen on Facebook with blood all over his body. Mrs Oseni said officials of the ministry during a visit to the home gathered that the boy was assaulted by his mother. “The rescue team did not meet the mother but was later sighted at a different location and was apprehended by government officials who took her into police custody for questioning,” she added. The DCR director said that the matter was presented at the police station, and the woman’s husband was directed to produce the boy while the woman was at the police station. Meanwhile, the boy has been taken to the Ministry of Youth and Social Development for placement and appropriate  medical care.
