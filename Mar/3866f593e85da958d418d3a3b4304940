Kano State Government has ordered closure of all routes linking the state from other parts of the country from Friday in a bid to curb the spread of COVID-19. The decision, according to the government, is hard but necessary especially as the state is yet to record any positive caseb. This was contained in a statement signed at mid – night by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Abba Anwar. It said:  “This decision is hard, but absolutely necessary, as part of precautionary measures against the deadly COVID-19 possible spread. We urge Kano citizens and all other Nigerians to bear with this difficult situation. “People must cooperate with health workers and all other stakeholders to make sure that our state is safe and the country in general.” Governor Umar Ganduje added: “All members of the public should stay away from going to markets, unless for essential needs”. While borders would remain shut, according to the governor, the state would continue studying the situation and keep people abreast of any development. “We are therefore calling on people to keep on praying and make sure that they always abide by all the medical advices given by health workers,” he urged.
