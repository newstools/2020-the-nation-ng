Julius Okorie Nigeria born Heracles Almelo forward Cyriel Dessers was among the 24 players called up by Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr ahead of the double header 2021 African cup of Nations qualifier against Leone stars of Sierra Leone. The 25- year- old product of Nigerian father and Belgian mother has been in superlative form recently and has captured the attention of the Nigerian media. Dessers himself in a recent interview believes that playing for Nigeria will boost his soccer career noting that invitation to any national team does not come on a platter and should be celebrated when it comes. His inclusion in the 24- man list dished out by Rohr on Wednesday will no doubt take the young man to cloud nine. The interesting thing about the list is the return of Kelechi Iheanacho whose rejuvenation recently has also been noted by technical crew and fans alike. Also interesting to note is the inclusion of Germany based defender Kingsley Ehizibue who plays for FC Koln and who will be making appearance for the first time for the Super Eagles. The usuals were not missing with Daniel Akpeyi expectedly making it coming after he posted a splendid performance for his South African Side Kaizer chiefs in their Soweto Derby against hard fighting Orlando Pirates. The match which attracted massive turnout at the FNB Stadium, saw many agreeing that the Nigerian international was indeed good after he made breath-taking saves to keep Pirates away with Chiefs running away with a lone goal victory to consolidate on the log.
