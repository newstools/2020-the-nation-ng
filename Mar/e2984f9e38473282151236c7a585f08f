The Nigerian Indigenous Ship-owners Association (NISA) has urged the leadership of Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) to prioritise industry stakeholders’ interest. A member of the NISA Steering Committee, Captain Taiwo Akinpelumi, made his appeal at the weekend. He described the immediate past Director-General of NIMASA, Dr Dakuku Peterside, as a glamourous administration which failed to tackle top industry issues. Akinpelumi, also the Chief Executive Officer, Oceanic Energy Limited, expressed optimism that with stakeholders’ interest as top priority, NIMASA could usher in development of the industry. “The new administration must address the non-disbursement of Cabotage Vessel Financing Fund and the proposed Maritime Fund that nobody is talking about. They must recognise associations which seek to address the industry issues and not only relate with individuals who chase personal gains,” he said. Akinpelumi regretted that the situation of seafarers and ship-owners has not fared better  in the last four years. This, he said, was irrespective of the assistance offered by members of NISA to help as technocrats to show the path to follow  to develop indigenous shipping, which unfortunately, was not appreciated by the agency. He fumed at the floating dock acquired by NIMASA, which is wasting away at the Naval Dockyard in Victoria Island, Lagos. Although the Peterside administration did not initiate the N50 billion floating dock project, Akinpelumi blamed the NIMASA boss for allowing the investment rot away at the Naval Dockyard, thereby incurring $30,000 daily for over a year.
