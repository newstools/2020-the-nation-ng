 Family members and associates of late Mrs Modupe Christiana Maboreje (nee Shitta) have paid glowing tributes to her, one year after she died. The woman, who until her death was the wife of a Lagos-based businessman, Mr Akinkunmi Maboreje, was described by her husband, relatives and friends as irreplaceable. Speaking during  her one year remembrance,  held penultimate Saturday at the Fadeyi area of Lagos,  Maboreje said it would be difficult to fill the vacuum left by his late wife. He said: ”Our paths crossed one glorious day and I thought we shall both stay long on earth to share and enjoy this beautiful life together but death snatched her away from me and the children. Since then, life has never been the same because she is always on my mind, the vacuum she left in my life and that of the children cannot be filled by anyone. He added: ” When Modupe was alive, she was a loving, caring wife to me and good mother to her children.  I wonder why death plucked her of all people, she was too good to people and that is why many people were shocked when her death was announced. Her death was a big blow to all. We shall all die one day but I never knew Modupe will die that soon.  I hope she finds a better place in the bossom of the Lord where we shall meet and part no more.”
