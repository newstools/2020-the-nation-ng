 THE Edo State Government has insisted that marketers of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) across the state must dispense the product at the approved pump price of N125 per litre. Commissioner for Minerals, Oil and Gas, Hon. Joseph Ikpea, who addressed journalists while monitoring operations of petrol stations in Benin City, said the essence of the exercise is to ensure dealers comply with the Federal Government’s directive to dispense PMS at N125 per litre. He said the state government is not only concerned about the pump price but the accuracy of metering of petroleum products to motorists, noting, “Complying with the new pump price is not the only issue because some people can reduce the quantity of litres dispensed to motorist and adjust the pump price to reflect the N125 per litre. “Parts of the function of the ministry is to ensure compliance among major and independent marketers. To some extent, the level of compliance is commendable,” Ikpea said. At the stations visited, the dealers dispensed the product at the new approved pump price. An MRS Service station manager, Mr Adenuga Sunday, said the station adjusted its pump price a week ago after the directive from the Federal Government. He urged other major marketers to comply with the directive in the interest of the general public.
