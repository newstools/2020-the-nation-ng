The Permanent Secretary Ministry of Youth and Sports Development, Gabriel Aduda has confirmed that four States- Delta, Kaduna, Imo and Ogun have indicated interest to host the 2022 National Sports Festival. Aduda, while confirming this, said the official bids were submitted by the state Commissioners of Sports and the ministry through its in-house bidding committee will examine the bids base on merit and make appropriate recommendation as the next host will be announced during the closing ceremony of Edo 2020 National Sports Festival. He said two states would be on standby if the first choice failed to meet up with the facilities needed to host a successful festival. “We are very happy to see the interest shown by states. It is quite encouraging and which means states are ready to engage the youths meaningfully.  Sports is a unifying factor and is gathering of future champions. National Sports Festival is about unity, culture, entertainment and above all a grassroot sports development. “It will also enable the bidding states to upgrade and renovate their sporting facilities with modern equipment and even construct new sports hall for the games.  National Sports Festival is our own Olympics and the Sports Ministry will always ensure we have the best at all time. I can tell you now that Edo government is ready to receive the athletes and the Sports Ministry is also ready for the festival scheduled to hold from March 22 to April 1 in Benin.
