As a result of the raging Coronavirus pandemic, the Investments and Securities Tribunal (IST) has suspended all Tribunal sittings until further notice. Also suspended until further notice by the tribunal are all scheduled official trips and trainings. The statement signed by the Head; Corporate Affairs Department of the IST Mrs Nimma Egun said “all official gatherings/programmes requiring the attendance of more than 20 persons have been suspended until the ban has been lifted by the FCT administration.” Before suspending activities at the tribunal, the management of the Investments and Securities Tribunal on Monday scaled down its operations to the barest minimum. The Acting Chairman of the Tribunal Barr Ike Udunni met with the management staff where he told them that “it had become imperative for the Tribunal to scale down some of its operations to shield her staff and clients from the exposure to the virus and ensure their safety.” Staff permitted to be in the Tribunal premises during office hours are Heads of Departments, Divisions and Units, Directors, the Chief Registrar, Honourable Members and the Ag. Chairman. She stated that other key staff identified by the management maybe permitted to be in the office during work hours. Staff not in the category earlier mentioned have been advised to stay at home and observe good personal hygiene, social distancing, and ensure that family members are adequately sensitized to the dangers of the virus and minimize body contact as much as possible. The Ag. Chairman of the Tribunal Barr Ike Udunni urged staff that are required to be in the office to take advantage of hygiene measures that have been put in place within the office premises. He stated that “age long home remedies for the treatment of cold are effective and may be explored in keeping our respiratory organs in good shape.” Normal operations he said “would resume in the Tribunal as soon as the containment of the COVID-19 Virus is achieved.”
