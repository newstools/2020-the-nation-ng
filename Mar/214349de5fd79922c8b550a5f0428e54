By Kelvin Osa Okunbor  British Government is consolidating efforts towards the evacuation of its nationals in Nigeria. A highly placed industry source confided in The Nation that British government has applied to the Ministry of Aviation, Abuja to secure flight permit in line with the conditions attached to essential flights after Nigerian government shut its airports in the aftermath of the spread of COVID-19. The source hinted that the British government will utilize British Airways for the evacuation flights when eventually the permit sails through at the Ministry of Aviation. An official of the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) who confirmed the development said the authority is awaiting permit approval from the Ministry of Aviation in Abuja to enable its officials’ process approval for the intending flight. The official said:” I can confirm to you that the British government has applied to the Ministry. After the approval of permit in Abuja, the NCAA will process the application and revert to the Ministry for clearance for the evacuation flight to take place.” He, however, said the NCAA could not put a timeline on when the processes will be cleared.
