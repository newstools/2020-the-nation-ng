Access BankGroup Managing Director, Mr. Herbert Wigwe has said the bank’s performance was a reflection of its sustainable business model and effective execution. He said the bank’s focus on retail gained momentum during the year as continued investments in its channels platform resulted in contribution to gross fee and commission income. According to him, the strong retail contribution demonstrates the effectiveness of the bank’s continued drive around low-cost deposits, on the back of an innovative digital platform. “Additionally, we will remain disciplined in our efforts to deliver enhanced shareholder value, as we continue to realise the synergies from our newly expanded franchise,” Wigwe said.
