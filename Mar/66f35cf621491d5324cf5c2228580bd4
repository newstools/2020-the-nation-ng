Rotary International District 9110, comprising of Rotary clubs in Lagos and Ogun states, has donated N2 million to the Abule-Ado fire disaster relief fund. District Governor Jide Akeredolu said it became expedient for the District to respond to calls by the Lagos State government, considering the degree of humanitarian situation. Akeredolu added that the donation is one of the several avenues through which Rotarians collaborate with governments to make the world a better place. According to him, Rotary’s six areas of focus – Peace Building and Conflict Prevention; Water, Sanitation and Hygiene; Disease Prevention and Treatment; Maternal and Child Health; Economic Community Development; Basic Education and Literacy – have continued to shape the direction in which Rotary funds are spent every year.
