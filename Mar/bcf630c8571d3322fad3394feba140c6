There was pandemonium at the Adeniran Ogunsanya College of Education (AOCOED), Ijanikin, Lagos State yesterday, as the workers rescued one of their colleagues simply identified as Haruna from the police. The Nation learnt that Haruna was already handcuffed by the police and was about to be taken to the station when the leaders of the unions rescued him. This incident followed an earlier altercation between the leadership of the unions and the college management, leading to accusations and counter-accusations. It was gathered that the unions, namely College of Education Academic Staff Union (COEASU), Non Academic Staff Unions (NASU), Senior Staff Unions of College of Education in Nigeria (SSUCOEN) and National Academic Staff Technologists of Colleges of Education (NACEATYON) accused the Registrar and Bursar, Messrs. Shehu Muhideen and Adeyanju Adebisi of allegedly being culpable of financial instability and causing incessant frictions between the management and workers. The unions later demanded that the duo should take a walk from the meeting to their homes without taking a pin from their offices, to allow proper investigation, a development that heightened tension. Unknowing to the duo, their carsâ€™ tyres had been deflated on the directive of the unions, a development that eventually brought in the police who arrested and handcuffed Haruna when he was found locking up the offices of the two principal officers. At press time another meeting was ongoing between the management and the unions, but without the presence of the aforementioned officers. AOCOED spokesperson Mrs. Funmi Makanjuola pleaded that she would fully brief the media at the appropriate time, noting that the management was on top of the matter. The registrar did not respond to the calls made to him.
