During a briefing which had in attendance a few top luxury real estate brokers, consisting of Wealth and Facility Managers in the country the MD/CEO, Sujimoto, Sijibomi Ogundele said that “the Giuliano is more than a building. “It is a story of resilience. Despite more than 2,000 empty apartments in Ikoyi and Banana Island, the Giuliano was sold out because of the quality, attention to detail and proficient installation of luxury accessories,” he said. Speaking on its latest project, Sijibomi Ogundele said that even though they are just concluding the Lucrezia foundation, almost half of the units are gone because people are beginning to realise the investment value in their projects. “A lady who bought the Giuliano off-plan at N320million, recently sold for N480million, giving massive returns of N130 million within the space of just seven months.” Ogundele also noted that this will be the company’s last residential project and as a result the company is bent on creating a lasting architectural masterpiece with the LucreziaBySujimoto. According to him, “that is why we are making sure from foundation to finishing, the Lucrezia will be the standard for luxury projects, not just in Banana Island but also in the world.”
