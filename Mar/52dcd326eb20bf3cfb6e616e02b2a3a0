With the completion of AIICO Insurance Plc private placement investment by two strategic investors, the company plans to raise N6.7 billion from shareholders. The company’s paid up share capital increased from N6.1 billion to N11.3 billion following the conclusion of the private placement phase of its recapitalisation with an uptake of 38.83 per cent of its shares by the two strategic investors. The investors are LeapFrog Nigeria Insurance Holdings Limited, which acquired 28.24 percent stake while AIICO Bahamas Nigeria Limited acquired 10.59 percent stake, bringing total capital of the company from N6.1 billion to N11.3 billion. The company had earlier received shareholders’ approval to increase its authorised share capital to N18 billion through various instruments to meet the new minimum capital base for a composite insurer based on the National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) guidelines. At the Extra-Ordinary General Meeting (EGM), which held in Lagos, the shareholders demonstrated their support by voting in favour of the proposition to raise additional capital through a rights issue. The company’s Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Babatunde Fajemirokun, said the future looks bright, adding that they are making progress in positioning for long-term sustainability. He said: “Increasing our capital base, will enable us strengthen our balance sheet, provide additional capacity to underwrite more risks and deliver better returns to our shareholders. “Our history of stability and reliability has earned us a place of admiration in the minds of our esteemed customers. We are putting structures in place to continuously delight and excite them with innovative products and superior service experience.
