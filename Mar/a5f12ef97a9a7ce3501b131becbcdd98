Most Africa players are based in Europe and some of them have tested positive. It is good to avoid further spread. I am in touch with my players and I monitor their process in their various clubs. “So shifting the qualifiers have no effect on us because my players are fit and ready at any time.  You will also know that some countries even in Africa have suspended sporting activities.  Health is important. I have spoken to my Captain Ahmed Musa and virtually all the invited players to be on standby as we watch development.  Football is a game of contact so measures must be taken. Playing Sierra Leone in Asaba will not a problem because my boys are active in their club and I am sure of victory at any time it is rescheduled,” Rohr stated.
