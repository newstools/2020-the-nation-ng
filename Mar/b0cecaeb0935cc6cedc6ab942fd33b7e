 bout 5,000 Students attending tertiary institutions in Kwara State would attempt to break the world record for the largest number of students participating in practical learning in one place on March 21, 2020. The record breaking activity will hold during the Science Awareness Conference organised by the Science Ambassadors Foundation (SAF) at the University of Ilorin. The conference with theme: Innovate Kwara, would feature the Kwara-UNILORIN Innovation Hackathon to exhibit technology innovations in the area of renewable energy developed to address local problems by about 50 teams of students. At a press briefing in Lagos to announce the event, Country Director SAF, Mrs. Peace Nnabugwu, said the Foundation was collaborating with Central Electric and Utilities with the backing of the Kwara State Ministry of Tertiary Education and Communication on the event to enhance the scientific skills of young people in fun ways. “Teaching science subjects should be innovative and fun if we are to get young people to participate in it,” she said. She said during the world record challenge, the participants would carry out three experiments. Apart from the world record, Mrs. Nnabugwu said winners of the Hackathon tech challenge would get to represent Nigeria in the United States. Nnabugwu, a Ph.D student at the UNILORIN Renewable Energy Centre (UREC), is also a 2019 U.S. TechWomen Fellow.  She said the students who would showcase their work at the event were already being mentored by technology experts both in Nigeria and abroad. Other partners like Finlab, Studylab360.com have donated scientific equipment and prizes towards the event.
