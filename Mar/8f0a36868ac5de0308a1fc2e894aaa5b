The Osun Government has announced the closure of its borders as part of measures to check the spread of the coronavirus in the state. Mr Wole Oyebamiji, the Secretary to the State Government, who made the announcement on Friday in Osogbo, said the closure would take effect from Saturday. Oyebamiji said that all major markets as well as shopping malls would also be shut, with the exception of pharmaceutical, foods and medical needs outlets. He also said that government was limiting the boarding capacity of vehicles operating within the state as part of ongoing measures to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the state. The SSG said all motorcycles would henceforth be allowed to carry only one passenger, while all mini-buses would carry only four passengers with one passenger in front, one in the middle and two at the back seat. Oyebamiji advised all returnees from the United Kingdom, United States and other high risk countries, who returned to Osun in the last two weeks, to call the stateâ€™s emergency number 293 for instructions on how to stay safe.
