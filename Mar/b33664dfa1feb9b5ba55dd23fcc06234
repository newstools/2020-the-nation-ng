The National Publicity Secrerary of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu has refuted any crack in the party’s National Working Committee (NWC). He said the committee has not been factionalised. He also pointed out that the nature of crisis being repeatedly reported in a section of the media was a normal feature in politics. These were contained in a statement issued in Abuja on Monday night by the APC spokesperson. Issa-Onilu maintained that contestations are not unusual and are not necessarily intractable in a political organisation like the ruling APC. He explained that issues being alluded to in the media reports are matters before the courts and should be allowed to run their normal and legal course. The APC spokesperson noted that the “exaggerated story foreboding armageddon is far-fetched”. The National Publicity Secretary then called on members of the National Working Committee (NWC) and the Party’s secretariat staff to resume at their offices and continue carrying out their scheduled roles and responsibilities without any fear. He assured party members within and outside the country that the party’s leaders are capable of resolving any contestations that may arise bearing in mind the best interests of the party and in the pursuit of progress and development of the country. The APC chieftain then commended the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Abubakar Adamu, personnel of the Police, Department of State Services and other Security Services for their professionalism in the process of maintaining the peace and preventing hoodlums from formenting trouble at the APC National Secretariat.
