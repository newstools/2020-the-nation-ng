The Baale of Candoso community in Ayobo- Ipaja Local Council Development Area (LCDA) of Lagos State, High Chief Moroof Owonla has urged the three senators representing the state at the National Assembly, Abuja,  to ensure the upgrading of the 37 Local Council Development Areas to substantive local government areas. He implored Senators Oluremi Tinubu (Lagos Central);  Solomon Adeola Olamilekan (Yayi) (Lagos West); and Adebayo Osinowo aka Pepper (Lagos East), to quickly sponsor a bill to that effect on the floor of the red chamber. Owonla made the appeal during a meeting he held on Friday with community stakeholders including artisans, market women, landlords and youth leaders in his palace, urging members of House of Representatives from the state to also do same, so as to enhance further development of rural areas in the state. He stated that the actual motive behind the creation of the LCDAs during the administration of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu was for the extension of the dividends of democracy to all nooks and crannies of the state, saying the dream was almost frustrated by the then Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) led Federal Government. He said it was time for Lagos lawmakers at the National Assembly to grab the opportunity of their party, APC being at the control in the centre and bring home 57 Local Governments (LGs) or more, instead of 20 LGs and 37 LCDAs. He added that the upgrade would further open unquantifiable business developments in the hitherto undeveloped areas in the state.
