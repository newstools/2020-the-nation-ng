Commercial sex workers, street traders and artisans constituting nuisance at Ikoyi in Lagos State and on major highways have been warned to vacate or face prosecution. The Corps Marshal, Lagos State Environmental Sanitation Corps (LAGESC), CP Gbemisola Akinpelu (retd), gave the warning on Thursday. She said that the agency had intensified a clampdown on persons causing obstruction and constituting nuisance. The Nation reports that the agency, in collaboration with partners, began ‘Operation Clean-Up Ikoyi and Victoria Island’ last year, which saw the removal of illegal structures, shanties, brothels and a clampdown on commercial sex workers on the axis. Akinpelu said that the renewed vigour followed directives by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu that all roads be cleared of impediments to allow free flow of traffic and identify persons or things causing harm to residents. She said the agency will tackle recalcitrant traders who have refused to obey warnings. According to a statement by LAGESC’s Public Affairs Officer (PAO) Kehinde Adebayo, the Corps Marshal also warned those trading on walkways to desist “because these places are meant for pedestrians.” Akinpelu decried increase in the number of street hawkers across major highways, saying they posed security risks to motorists. She said that armed robbers usually disguised to attack road users. The LAGESC boss said her officials have been directed to apprehend defaulters. “Our roads are not meant for trading. People have been advised to go into state approved markets to engage in legal trading. Many lives have been lost due to brake failure or carelessness by reckless drivers. “Some roads are usually blocked as a result of activities of traders who display their goods on walkways and roadsides, thereby impeding free vehicular and human movements,” she said.
