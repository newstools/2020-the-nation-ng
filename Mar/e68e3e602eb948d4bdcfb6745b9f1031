 THEY looked stable and unruffled as they emerged from the hospital’s main entrance. Although, they preferred anonymity, they expressed joy and satisfaction with the treatment they received. While thanking Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, for his support, they pleaded that the workers at the Centre be better treated. One of them said, “I came in here on the 15th  of March and after the test showed positive, I was asked to come back the next day. So, I did and was admitted. “Initially, there were hitches, but they later turned out fine. The health workers did fine.  All our challenges were attended to. I’m a living witness together with my other colleagues.” He preached hope, saying people should not panic as COVID-19  would be defeated. ”We can beat it(Coronavirus). I want to assure others still on admission that this is not their resting place. They should encourage themselves, they should take their medications and in no distant time, they will get out of here. “I want to appeal to the federal and  Lagos State government  to  remunerate all those workers who have volunteered to work accordingly, so as to serve as encouragement to others. Their life should be insured too. “If they are not here as first responders, many would have died.” Another discharged patient said: “I was admitted a week ago. Initially, there were challenges, but the following day, they brought some beds, masks and equipment. “Apart from what my colleague said, the workers should be insured. Proper insurance will let people do what they have to do.” He narrated a scenario where the workers could not attend to him because he tested positive, saying: “they went back and I slept off. I woke up around 3 am. So, they deserve life insurance to encourage them to do their job.”
