The Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) in Cross River State has suspended its strike. The union went on strike on March 12 to protest the abduction of the wife of their colleague, Mrs. Christiana Ekanem. Ekanem was kidnapped in her home in Calabar on March 10, and was released on March 21, after 11 days in captivity. NMA Chairman Dr Agam Ayuk, who addressed reporters yesterday, said the strike was called off following  Ekanem’s release. He said: “The indefinite withdrawal of medical services in both private and public hospitals is hereby suspended; medical and dental practitioners are directed to resume duties immediately. “The association remains grateful to everyone who supported the family and the association to ensure Mrs. Ekanem’s safe release. “The poor security situation in Cross River remains a daily reality as people continue to live in fear. We, therefore, reiterate our call on the government to show more political will and put measures in place to secure lives and properties as that remains its primary constitutional responsibility. “NMA sincerely hopes that this is the last time it would take the difficult decision of withdrawing medical services in the event of kidnapping of her members, and also hopes that our collective resolve will not be put to test again.” Ayuk, however, said NMA would not fail to invoke its collective resolve of January 8, 2018, saying ‘NMA in Cross River shall withdraw services without notice whenever a doctor or a dependent is taken captive in future’. He added: “The Covid-19 pandemic is a reality with increasing number of confirmed cases. We, therefore, call on the government to ban large gatherings. We also advise people to take recommended guidelines on social distancing, hand hygiene and respiratory hygiene seriously. “NMA in Cross River shall be donating hand sanitisers to public and private hospitals across the state to support the efforts of government at preventing and containing Covid-19.”
