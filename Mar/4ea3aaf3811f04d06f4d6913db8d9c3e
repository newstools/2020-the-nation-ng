The All Progressives Congress (APC), Kano State chapter, has urged Kaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai to create an emirate for the dethroned Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II, since the deposed Emir has suddenly become the governor’s hero despite his unjustified criticism of the APC administration. El-Rufai last week appointed Sanusi as the Chancellor of the Kaduna State University and Vice Chairman of the board of the Kaduna Investment Promotion Agency (KADIP). The governor also visited Sanusi in Awe, Nasarawa State, where he was banished to and eventually accompanied him to Lagos State after his release. Reacting to the developments in a statement through the Kano APC Deputy Chairman, Shehu Maigari, the party lamented that El-Rufai decided to treat Sanusi like a hero despite criticising President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration with no reasons or justifications. The statement added: “Sir, APC Kano chapter is advising you to create an additional emirate in your state like the New Kaduna Emirate Council, probably to start from Rigachikun to Kasuwar Magani and install your hero there, so that he can work for his party (PDP) over there, instead of giving him those ceremonial positions. “Your Excellency, Governor Nasir el-Rufai, this is somebody who worked against the success of APC, your party, coming out openly to criticise your mentor (Mr. President) with no concrete reasons or justifications, yet you have decided to lionise him. “Sir, APC Kano chapter is strongly advising you to create an additional emirate in your state like the New Kaduna Emirate Council, probably to start from Riga Chikum to Kasuwar Magani and install your hero there, so that he can work effectively for his dear party (PDP) over there, instead of giving him those ceremonial positions.”
