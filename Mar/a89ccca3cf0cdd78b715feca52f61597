Ogun State Government has warned those encroaching on the right of ways, pipelines, setbacks of public utilities and infrastructure on the Lagos-Ibadan, Lagos-Abeokuta Expressways, and such other roads, to vacate such premises or risk governmentâ€™s sanction. A statement by the Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development Olatunji Odunlami said the step became imperative to rid the state of flooding and improper structures that were inimical to a clean and aesthetic environment. It added that operators of businesses such as sales of heavy duty equipment, hiring and leasing, illegal bus trading points, illegal markets, block makers, mechanic workshops, car sellers, oil product dealers, containers, drums and kiosks erected at road sides and other unauthorised places should remove them forthwith as enforcement of the right of ways would soon begin. The statement advised property owners who have leased out the frontage of their houses for commercial purposes to desist forthwith as culprits would have their Certificate of Occupancy, Building Permits withdrawn and such property sealed off.
