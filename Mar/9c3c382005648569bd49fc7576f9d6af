Osimhen, when invited to speak about his relationship with Campos said: “Luis Campos has always played an important role in my life: he watched me during the U17s World Cup in Chile and since then we have never been out of contact,” Osimhen told RMC. “We have a very good relationship and I am very happy, he has helped me and motivated me to become the player that I am today. “We are genuinely close and I am very happy to know someone like Luis Campos and to be with him day to day and I am delighted to be able to work with him.” The 20 year old, who has scored 13 goals and four assists in 24 Ligue 1 starts added that he is close to French midfielder Boubakary Soumaré because he has a special connection with the 21-year-old and they are close age-wise. He said: “It is difficult to speak about a singular player, everyone is important but I would like to mention my relationship with Bouba(kary) Soumaré in the team. When we play together we have a unique connection and I am very happy to play with him, we are both young and are able to count on experienced players.”
