 Nollywood actor, Seun Kentebe has apologised to fans and the entire public for posting misleading news on his Twitter handle. The actor had erroneously informed fans and the public that President Muhammadu Buhari attended Jumat service on Friday, March 20 without addressing the populace over the coronavirus pandemic. He wrote, “Apologies and clarifications are in order: First off, I apologize for the post I uploaded from Twitter about GMB attending Jumat last Friday. It was fake news and I should’ve verified it before posting.”  However, Kentebe chided Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde for holding a rally even after the governor had apologised for his actions. He said, “Concerning Governor Makinde’s organizing a rally, please note that while his apology was commendable, his action led to the spread of the virus and may lead to the untimely deaths of a number of citizens; I put up a tweet asking him and Davido to self-isolate themselves so as not to put other innocents at risk. “Inasmuch as we crave for “Good Public servants” in every sense of the word, we shouldn’t hesitate to point out their wrongdoing. Lastly, I also apologize for insisting GMB address the general public… We know how that went.”
