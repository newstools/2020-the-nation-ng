Osagie Otabor, Akure Residents of Akure South Constituency 1 almost mobbed Hon Toluwani Borokini, the lawmaker representing them at the Ondo State House of Assembly. Hon Borokini was sensitising his constituents about the dangers of spreading coronavirus while distributing hand sanitisers, face masks and hand gloves when a large crowd swooped on him with a view to getting one. Borokini however told them he bought many that would be enough for them. He however cautioned them to observe social and physical distancing.   Explaining why he was in the street, Hon Borokini said the gesture was to give back to the people for them to stay healthy. Hon Borokini aaid he was shocked at the exorbitant price items such as sanitisers, gloves and face were being sold because of COVID-19. According to him, “How do we explain the outrageous prices of face masks and hand gloves in the face of COVID-19? How justifiable is this increase? “A pack, which sells for #700- #1000 is now being sold for #15, 000. Why do we derive joy in making gains from pains? “Is corruption still from above or runs in the system of every Nigerian, but with different opportunities to exploit? “Nigeria may not get the healing we so much crave for, if we still have the myopic thought that political office holders are the root cause of our problems. “I have taken it as a responsibility in providing my constituents with sanitisers, hand gloves, face masks and other recommended items for prevention. “The use of the items have become imperative as one of the preventive measures in controlling the spread of the pandemic virus. “So far, a thousand of sanitiser, face masks and hand gloves have been distributed in my constituency. “I am willing to do more as need for them arises and request increases, for the sake of the masses and in order not to put my constituents at higher risk of the virus,”.
