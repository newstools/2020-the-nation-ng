From Tunde Liadi, Owerri  FC Nantes’ forward Moses Simon has urged his teammates in the Super Eagles to replicate their club form and not underrate the Leones of Sierra Leone in the double-header 2021 AFCON Qualifiers later this month in Asaba and Freetown. The Eagles will square up against Sierra Leone in Asaba at the Stephen Keshi Stadium on March 27 before the return leg at the Siaka Stevens Stadium, Freetown four days later. Simon has charged his teammates to lift their game and ensure they make their route to Cameroon 2021 as easy as possible with victory in both matches. “We must need to stay focused and play the way we do in our clubs not to underestimate them because there are no longer minnows,” Simon stated.” Whenever I’m called up I’m always happy and ready to represent my fatherland and give my best. It won’t be different against Sierra Leone also because it is my wish to feature in another AFCON after my first taste last year in Egypt. “We will continue to do our best in our respective clubs to ensure that we remain fit and competitive ahead of the games with Sierra Leone.” The striker cum winger who has scored five goals in the French League from 26 appearances out of 28 rated his strike against Paris Saint Germain in their 2-1 home loss as his best goal of the season thus far.
