The Main Organising Committee for the 20th National Sports Festival (NSF) tagged “Edo 2020” on Wendesday in Benin commended the level of renovation work so far at the University of Benin (UNIBEN) hostels. The Secretary of the (MOC) Peter Nelson expressed satisfaction with the level of work shortly after he led other members of the committee to inspect the facilities. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the UNIBEN hostels will be used as the Games Village for the upcoming NSF billed to hold from March 22 to April 1. “I must confess that what is on ground now is impressive, compared to what we saw the last time we came for inspection,” explained Nelson. “I know that the work is still in progress, and I know that government is trying hard to ensure that works are concluded before the festival.” NAN reports that no fewer than 11,000 athletes and officials are expected to participate in the NSF which will feature 39 events.
