 The Osun State government has commenced a  foreigners’ assessment at  mining sites as part of the strategy  to forestall the spread of   Coronavirus to the State. The exercise is being conducted by the State Ministry of Health. Health Commissioner Rafiu Isamotu told reporters during visits to some mining sites at Ogbagba in Ife-South Local Government Area that the exercise entails mapping out foreigners involved in mining in the state. None of the foreigners examined was found to be infected with coronavirus or any other disease, he said. Also speaking, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Public Health, Siji Olamiju, said the action was in furtherance of government’s commitment to stem the tide of epidemic diseases in the state as the administration of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola was determined to promote quality healthcare delivery. He said the exercise was not to stigmatize anyone “but to prevent those who might have been infected with Coronavirus from spreading the virus.” Olamiju said the exercise on the containment of Coronavirus had uncovered another public health challenge caused by illegal mining, adding that the government of Oyetola will not tolerate any form of irresponsible mining capable of causing environmental degradation. He said “the entire community has been destroyed by acid drilling caused by illegal and irresponsible mining where heavy metals find their way into the rivers or water that people drink which can cause serious public health challenges. “What we have seen here is not suitable and the government under the leadership of Governor Oyetola will not tolerate environmental damage of this magnitude. The government will ensure that miner go about their business responsibly.”
