Despite passing through trying times, Adams Oshiomhole looked unperturbed and unruffled on Thursday. Oshiomhole who was in his usual boisterous mood told a team of reporters in his Aso Drive Office, Abuja that there was no need for him to be troubled or pitied over development in the party. It what could be referred to as Oshiomhole’s first public appearance after the Abuja High Court suspended him from, the APC leader decked in his usual khaki attire asked reporters: “Are you looking at me with pity?” Before the reporters could reply, he dashed out smiling into a waiting car.
