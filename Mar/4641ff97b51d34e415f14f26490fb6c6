The Chairman of Kaduna State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Rev. Joseph Hayab, has said Governor Nasir El-Rufai’s apology over the killing of 51 persons on Sunday had confirmed the association’s concerns about insecurity. The governor, during a visit to the affected communities of Igabi and Giwa local government areas on Monday, apologised to residents of the communities over the attack. He said: “I also came to apologise for failure to protect you fully. We are doing our best to minimise such incidents, you should continue to forgive us.” Hayab said the governor had confirmed CAN’s persistent cries that the state was not safe. The CAN chairman criticised the state government for not paying sufficient attention to security. He also advised those in power to sieve the advice they take from their aides, among others. “It is only when our leaders ignore bad advisers around them that all is going to be well with the people. To keep their jobs, they fail to give good advice to those in authority on what is happening to the man in the street. We may never get it right in this country,” Hayab said.
