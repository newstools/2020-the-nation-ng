Toba Adedeji, Osogbo  The Osun State Government has suspended weekly markets indefinitely to curb the spread of coronavirus in the State. The Chief Press Secretary to Osun State governor, Mr. Ismail Omipidan in a statement on Tuesday, said the Commissioner for Health, Dr. Rafiu Isamotu announced to market women on Tuesday that weekly markets activities have been shut down indefinitely. However, he noted that the government allow daily market because it only attracts low patronage, unlike the weekly market. Dr Isamotu stated that the lockdown was necessary due to the fact that Osun has boundaries with some States that have cases of the COVID-19 adding that people from neighbouring States patronise the weekly markets, which he said, makes Osun open to disease. The Commissioner, therefore, urged the market women to support governmentâ€™s effort in containing the spread of the disease by putting up hand-washing points and providing sanitizers for everyone who patronises them. He also warned people against loitering at markets, urging them to leave immediately after performing their transactions.
