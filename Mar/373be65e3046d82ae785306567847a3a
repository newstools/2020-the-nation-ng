The Enugu Catholic Diocese has restricted attendance at burial ceremonies to only direct family members of deceased, due to the global COVID 19 pandemic. In a statement on Monday in Enugu, the Diocesan Bishop of Enugu, Most Reverend Callistus Onaga, said the measure was to curtail the spread of Covid-19 in the state. Onaga advised persons planning social activities or weddings to postpone the events, saying; “whatever cannot wait should be restricted to the immediate concerned persons.” The cleric urged Parish Priests and Chaplains to increase number of Masses in order to reduce the population of attendance at each Mass. “No Sunday Mass should last more than 45 minutes, while weekday Mass should last for 30 minutes and there should be no preaching. “In all Masses, the sign of peace (handshaking, hugging), should henceforth be suspended until further notice; and only three or four persons should be on a pew (seat), depending on its length,” Onaga said in statement. He also said that Holy Communion should be received in the hand, and directed priests to instruct the faithful on how to receive the Eucharist. Onaga advised priests and indigenes staying outside Enugu State not to come home for Easter, in order to curtail the spread of the virus. This statement comes barely 48 hours after the Diocese issued some pastoral guidelines concerning the Corona virus outbreak. (NAN)
