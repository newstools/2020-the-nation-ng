 PRESTIGE Assurance Plc has increased the offer size of its rights issue from N6.73 billion to N6.82 billion as the insurance company seeks to strengthen its capital base. Under the revised terms of the rights issue, Prestige Assurance will now be offering 13.636 billion ordinary shares of 50 kobo each at a per value of 50 kobo. The rights will now be pre-allotted on the basis of 38 new ordinary shares for every 15 ordinary shares held as at January 31, 2020. Prestige Assurance had initially proposed to offer 13.465 billion ordinary shares of 50 kobo each at 50 kobo per value on the basis of five new ordinary shares for every two ordinary shares held as at January 31, 2020. Shareholders of Prestige Assurance had created additional new 14 billion ordinary shares to create headroom for the new capital raising. Prestige Assurance increased its authorised share capital from N3 billion of 6.0 billion ordinary shares of 50 kobo each to N10 billion of 20 billion ordinary shares of 50 kobo each through the creation of additional 14 billion ordinary shares of 50 kobo each. Shareholders also authorised the board of directors of the company to raise “capital by way most suitable to the company in line with the recapitalisation requirement of the National Insurance Commission”. The New India Assurance Company Limited, Mumbai, the precursor and founder of Prestige Assurance, holds 69.50 per cent majority equity stake in the Nigerian subsidiary while Leadway Assurance Company, an unlisted Nigerian insurance company, holds 11.47 per cent equity stake. Insurance companies are in a hot race to raise new equity capital to meet new minimum capital requirements for various insurance functions as directed by NAICOM. NAICOM had in May 2019 released new capital requirements for insurance businesses with a 13-month compliance period for operators to shore up their minimum capital base to the required level. The minimum paid-up share capital of a life insurance company was increased from N2 billion to N8 billion, non-life insurance from N3 billion to N10 billion, composite insurance from N5 billion to N18 billion while re-insurance companies were directed to raise their capital base from N10 billion to N20 billion. The deadline was subsequently extended to December 31, 2020.
