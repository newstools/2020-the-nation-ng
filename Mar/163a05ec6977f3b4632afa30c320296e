When it comes to praise and worship, Ooni of Ife’s wife, Queen Naomi Ogunwusi, is powerful. It was even suggested that it could be one of the qualities that attracted the king to her.  She is a renowned evangelist and her marriage to the traditional ruler has not taken that from her. But at the recent Aje Festival’s reception, the queen showed another side of her personality that many people don’t often get to see. She couldn’t resist Haruna Ishola’s melody and praises of her. She grooved to the ‘apala’ singer’s live performance and it went on for a while. Naomi became Ooni’s wife in October 2018 and they have looked like a match made in heaven since the union.
