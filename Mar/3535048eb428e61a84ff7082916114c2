As the world celebrated the International Women’s Day last Sunday, women across the globe have been urged to build gender equal world which is essential for economies and communities to thrive. Titilope Olubisi Ejimagwa, first black Director of Longrich made this remarks in a statement to mark the day in Lagos. She explained that collective responsibility is necessary in driving a gender equal world. Ejimagwa explained that equality is not women’s issue but a business issue. She harped on the fact that women should strive to engage in things that men are engaged in and even do them better, saying “there should be nothing a man can do that women shouldn’t do and even better.” She added “our individual actions, conversations and mindsets can have an impact on our larger society. Then there is need for each individual to realize that when equality challenges become a restrictive norm and self-doubt is avoided, we will definitely have an equal world.” She then encouraged all women to join hands in order to build a gender equal world.
