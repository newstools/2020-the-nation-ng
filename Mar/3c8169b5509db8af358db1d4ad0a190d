A Federal High Court in Osogbo, the Osun State capital, on Wednesday sentenced one Akinlade Dare, 27, to 12 months jail term with hard labour for cyber crime and stealing. Dare had earlier pleaded guilty to the charge of stealing 825 US dollars. Presiding judge, Justice Peter Lifu, convicted and sentenced him to an Ilesa correctional facility due to the magnitude of the offences committed. EFCC prosecutor, Mr Saleh Galadanchi, had told the court that the convict committed the offences on October 14, 2019 at Club Secretariat, Iwo-Osogbo Road, Osun State, adding that the convict defrauded one Michael Senqbusch of the sum of $825 via fake document transactions. Counsel to the convict, Mr Femi Fafowora, had prayed the court to temper justice with mercy.
