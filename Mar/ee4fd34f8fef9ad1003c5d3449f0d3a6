A final year student of the Federal Polytechnic Nekede, Owerri was Saturday night shot dead by unknown gunmen at Umuofocha, Umudibia in Owerri West Local Government Area of Imo State. The yet to be identified student was said to have been killed at about 11 pm at the back gate of the school close to the hostel where some Airforce personnel live. It was gathered that at about this time last year, an indigene of the community was also killed close to the place where the student was shot. There were speculations that the killing may be linked to campus confraternities but at press time, no one could say which group killed the student. A villager, who identified himself simply as Obinna, said that the student was found dead on Sunday morning covered in a pool of blood. “It was exactly the same spot where an indigene of the village was killed last year. The shocking thing is that the Airforce hostel is close to the place. “The incidence is reoccurring every year particularly when the school is about to graduate students or convocate, we are always experiencing one killing or the other in the community.” Police spokesman Orlando Ikeokwu, a superintendent, could neither confirm nor deny the killing, saying he would “get back” to the reporter. He did not before press time.
