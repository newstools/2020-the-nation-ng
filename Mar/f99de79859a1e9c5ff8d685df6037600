Adekunle Jimoh, Ilorin  Kwara state Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq has directed the suspension of Permanent Secretary for alleged extortion of farmers in the state. Others suspended alongside the permanent secretary, it was gathered are a director and accountant. The officials who are from the state’s ministry of agriculture were said to have engaged in the sale of unauthorised registration forms to farmers. In a statement spokesman to Governor AbdulRazaq, Rafiu Ajakaye said that the government at no time approved the sale of any forms to register farmers. He added that the administration found it strange that some officials could ever do such a thing to poor farmers. The statement reads: “In the light of the development, we wish to state the following: That neither the governor nor the Honourable Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development at any time approved the sale of forms to anyone, including farmers, in the guise of whatever scheme or census for farmers. “That preliminary in-house findings have been made and they suggested clear wrongdoings.
That the Head of Service has accordingly been directed to suspend all the affected officials, including the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry. This is to send the signal that such misconduct will not be condoned by the Governor. “That we call on the EFCC to immediately step in to investigate and prosecute anyone found guilty of ripping off the poor farmers, thus making it clear that his administration will never tolerate such behaviours under whatever guise. “And, finally, that the government will ensure the refund of the money of the victim-farmers who would be requested to bring forward the said forms that they purchased to claim their refund. The government sincerely regrets this embarrassing behaviour of the affected officials and apologises to the affected farmers.”
