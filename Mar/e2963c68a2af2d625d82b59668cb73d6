Those who were privileged to witness real estate merchant, Ololade Abuta’s birthday gig at Royal Oak Event Centre, Lekki, Lagos, recently, surely had a great time. Mayegun Wasiu Ayinde was on the bandstand and there were plenty to eat and drink. Actress Toyin Abraham was one of the Masters of Ceremony. But inasmuch as the party was hugely pleasant, certain things came up that almost spoilt the day. One was that the celebrant’s expensive phone got stolen. It was gathered she was less worried about the cost of the phone but the thought of losing vital information and contacts upset her. Also, the designer contacted to clothe her parents disappointed her. It was learnt that the Chief Executive Officer of Gracia Group of Companies planned to make a grand entrance with her son and parents. But that didn’t happen. The two setbacks threatened Abuta’s jolly mood but family and friends tried to cheer her up.
