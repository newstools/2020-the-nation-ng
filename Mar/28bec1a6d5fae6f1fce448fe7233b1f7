Hollywood actor, Idris Elba, has tested positive for Coronavirus. The actor disclosed this via his Twitter page. Elba said he had undergone a test for the deadly virus following exposure to a friend who tested positive. “This morning I tested positive for Covid 19. I feel OK, I have no symptoms so far,” Elba wrote on Twitter. “But I have been isolated since I found out about my possible exposure to the virus. “Stay home people and be pragmatic. I will keep you updated on how I’m doing fine no panic. ‘I’m doing ok and Sabrina (Idris Elba’s wife) hasn’t been tested. I got tested because I realised I got exposed to someone who had also tested positive. “I found out last Friday and I quarantined myself and got tested immediately and I got results back today. “There are people out there who aren’t showing symptoms and that can easily spread it so now is really the time to be vigilant about washing your hands and keeping distance. “We’ve told our families, they are very supportive, we’ve told our colleagues and transparency is probably the best thing right now. “We are living in a decided world and we can all fill it. I just want to share my news with you guys and I will keep you updated on how I’m doing. “This is serious, now is the time to think about social distancing,” he said via a Twitter video. He is the second Nollywood star to test positive after Tom Hanks and his wife Rita got infected in Australia.
