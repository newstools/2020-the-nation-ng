With repeated calls by World Health Organisation (WHO) to maintain social distance in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, Sterling Bank is offering Nigerians free access to quality healthcare service through digital channels for a period of 90 days. A statement by the bank states that the service is part of the Bank’s social intervention plans, aimed at cushioning the effects of the Covid19 and keep people safe at this critical period. Divisional Head, Health and Education Sectors, Sterling Bank PLC, Mr. Obinna Ukachukwu, according to the statement, held that the health sector is one of the five sectors that the Bank has invested in. The other sectors, he added, are education, agriculture, renewable energy and transportation. Ukachukwu said the bank’s intervention is aimed at helping Nigerians to maintain social distance, noting that the provision allows remote access to healthcare diagnosis, consultation, and subsequently advice and recommendations from best medical practitioners the country has. He described the initiative as “a huge opportunity for Nigerians to have access to quality healthcare. The platform is a reflection of the bank’s commitment to an improved and digitised health sector in the country. Clarifying what qualifies beneficiaries for the service, Ukachukwu notes that; “Our customers automatically qualify for this free medicare, but because the Sterling has a HEART, those who do not bank with us and may be at risk of contacting the contagion have been provided a cover under this initiative,” he assured. The statement added that the service will connect beneficiaries to medical doctors via online via chat, audio and video calls across the 36 states of the federation, 24 hours a day.
