Ekiti Governor Dr. Kayode Fayemi has felicitated with former Lagos State Governor, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, who clocks 68 on Sunday. Dr. Fayemi describes Tinubu as a leader of leaders, who has paid his dues in the country’s political firmament and beyond, thus deserving the respect of all and sundry across party lines. “Certainly, Asiwaju’s actions inspire us -his admirers – to dream more, learn more, do more and become more. “He is a political colossus who will continue to bestride the Nigerian political landscape for many more years to come,” Fayemi said in a statement in Ado-Ekiti. Fayemi observed that Tinubu’s political career started on a good footing when he was elected Senator representing Lagos West senatorial district, Lagos State in 1992 and had since remained a major factor in the politics of the country through his numerous leading roles notably as an exiled opposition leader to military dictatorship and his path finding roles in the current democratic dispensation since inception in 1999. “While wishing you a joyous birthday, I wish to observe as one of your admirers that you have indeed paid your dues and your birthday has become a festival, even if the COVID-19 has precluded us from a deserved celebration in your honour. “On behalf of my family, the government and good people of Ekiti State, the Land of Honour, I wish our indefatigable leader many more productive years in the service of our fatherland even as you retain your charm and political sagacity,” Fayemi said.
