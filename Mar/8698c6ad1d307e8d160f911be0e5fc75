The first distinguished personality lecture by the department of political science billed to hold Wednesday at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka was disrupted by striking members Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU). Speaker of Anambra State House of Assembly,  Hon Uche Okafor, an alumnus of the university, was billed to deliver the lecture Wednesday. It was however, an embarrassing and frustrating situation as striking members of  ASUU who are currently on strike besieged the venue and frustrated the event. Consequently, the lecture which was expected to start by 11am at the Princess Alexandria Auditorium was yet to commence as at 3:pm. The lecturers succeeded in disrupting the event as the speaker and other dignitaries were forced to relocate to a smaller hall at the Christ Church inside the campus. Following the two weeks warning strike declared by the Academic staff Union of universities, the Nsukka chapter of the union had on Tuesday deployed a monitoring patrol team to enforce the strike. The patrol team led by the chairman of the Nsukka chapter invaded Lecture halls to fish out defaulting lecturers. The strike has already grounded academic activities with the university turning into a ghost community following mass departure of students.
