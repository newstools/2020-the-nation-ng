TRANSNATIONAL Corporation of Nigeria (Transcorp) Plc is optimistic several measures taken to address operating constraints and improvement in the operating environment would lead to continuing growths in the years ahead. Against the background of the decline in the performance of the group in 2019, the management of Transcorp explained that the group performance was partly impacted by the decline in turnover in the power business due to gas supply, transmission and technical issues during the period. President, Transnational Corporation of Nigeria (Transcorp) Plc, Mr. Valentine Ozigbo, said the company contended with significant operational challenges in 2019, including severe gas shortages, mandated reduction in generation from the National Control Center and importantly, revenue exposures from delayed payment of receivables in our power business. He outlined that the company has taken several actions aimed at proactively and sustainably addressing these issues including activation of its gas supply and aggregation agreement, guaranteeing gas supply to its power plant in Ughelli and proactive engagement with gas transporter to prevent further vandalism of gas pipelines. He said the company has also engaged regulatory agencies to review regulatory actions negatively impacting power evacuation from its plant while carrying out preventive maintenance of its turbines. “The actualisation of these steps, as well as improvement in market payment for electricity generation, will facilitate our projected revenue expansion in 2020 and in coming years. This is in addition to even more significant contributions from our hospitality business, which is expected to benefit from the planned introduction of new service offerings,” Ozigbo said. He noted that the discharge of the hotel from the Bureau of Public Enterprise (BPE) post-privatisation monitoring in the outgoing year, further speaks to its operational excellence and top-line corporate governance.
