 THE 1996 Atlanta Olympics Games gold medallist, Chioma Ajunwa,  was the cynosure of all eyes  on in the football event of the on-going 12th Police Games taking place in Awka, Anambra state. Ajunwa, who won an Olympic gold medal for Nigeria in the long Jump event in Atlanta and was also at the World Cup in the colours of Falcons in 1991, is representing Zone 2 in the football tournament at the Police Games. Ajunwa scored a goal for her Zone 2 side in an earlier match  but she took ill and was advised by the medics to rest on Tuesday .But  she watched her Zone 2 side beat the Police Headquarters 1-0 in a keenly contested group encounter. Meanwhile, a nursing mother Mary Joseph was equally the toast of fans at the Rojeny stadium, Oba, venue of the athletics event, when she braced the  odds to claim silver medal. Joseph, who entered the tracks cuddling her two-year old baby before the event, finished in a time of 22.58 seconds behind Mamman Helen who won the gold medal at a time of 20.32 seconds. “Actually, this is my area of specialisation,” said Joseph who revealed she competed at the instance of her husband, a Police Inspector.”
