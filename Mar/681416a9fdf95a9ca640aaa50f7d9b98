  THE President, Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ),Christopher Isiguzo, has called on journalists to engage in more advocacy to prevent the passage of the Social Media Bill before the National Assembly. Isiguzo made the call on Tuesday in Lagos at an interactive session on “Promoting Media Freedom and Freedom of Expression in Nigeria’’. It was organised by the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) in Lagos. “We need to engage in more advocacy because from what I have heard, the leadership of NASS is bent on seeing the bill through,” he said. According to him, this is only possible if Nigerians fail to be vigilant in their opposition to the bill, which seeks to curtail their freedom of speech. He said that at the recent public hearing on the bill before the Senate, more than 95 per cent of memorandum received rejected the bill. “We feel that this bill constitutes an unnecessary distraction to our democratic space, and should be thrown out,’’ the NUJ president said. Isiguzo noted that several factors were militating against the freedom of the press in Nigeria, apart from obnoxious legislation. He said these included poor remuneration for journalists, refusal to pay salaries, ownership interest, harsh working environment and self-censorship.
