The National Coordinator, Social Integrity Network (SINET), Ibrahim Isah has urged  President Buhari to support the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in its ongoing intervention in manufacturing and agriculture. The said the interventions by the apex bank were the major proponents of job creation and growth. “We thank the president for his commitment and concern towards revamping the economic activities for the benefit of the masses,” he said. The group asked the Federal Government to  remove fuel subsidy to boost growth. In a statement, he said fuel subsidy removal was  necessary to enable the economy grow and avoid  revenue loss. He added that fuel subsidy is a leakage and threat to growth and development. “If the Federal Government can consider removal of subsidy on fuel along with the ongoing border closure policy, crashing of high rate of  Treasury bill without taxation and increase of Value Added Tax, (VAT) to 7.5 per cent, these will help in overhauling the economy,” he said. He said high rate of corrupt practices, conspiracy and maladministration are affecting the  economy, well-being of the masses as well as denting the image of the country in the international realm. ”However, in as much as it is pertinent for the government to protect the sanctity of the right of tax payers by guarding against revenue loss, oligarchy tendencies, fraud of all manners and economic sabotage, President Muhammadu Buhari should urgently make an executive order for the removal of fuel subsidy,” he added.
