 The National Industrial Court (NIC) on Tuesday struck out a suit by some aggrieved members of the Ogun State council of National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) for lack of jurisdiction. The aggrieved members – Haruna Adekonjo; Lukman Ajuwon; Jimoh Ajagbe; Funmilayo Odungbose; Sikiru Shoda and Jamiu Balogun –  are challenging the legality of the December 12, 2019 election. Justice Peter Dada held that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the suit because the claimants failed to explore internal mechanism of resolving the mater as stipulated by the union’s constitution before approaching the court. Justice Dada said Sections 42 (4) and (5) of the union’s constitution says no member has the right to institute civil suits against the union without first exploring internal mechanism of resolving the matter. According to him, the exhibit tendered by the claimants did not satisfy the union’s constitution. He said: “Failure of the claimants to comply with the union’s constitution before approaching the court has deprived the court the jurisdiction to hear the suit. The case is struck out for want of jurisdiction.” Justice Dada thereforeupheld the election of Alhaji Mustapha Ismail and his executive members.
