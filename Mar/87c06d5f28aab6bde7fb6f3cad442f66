 The National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress {APC), Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu has dismissed claim to his office by his deputy, Mr. Yekini Nabena and described it as a joke carried too far, insisting that he remains the party spokesperson. Issa-Onilu, who in a telephone interview said that Nebena was only chasing shadows, as he has no case in any court restraining him from carrying out his duties as the spokesperson of the governing party. Nabena had on Sunday in a statement in Abuja said he has taken over the office of the National Publicity Secretary on acting capacity, pending the time the Onilu will vacate a Sokoto High Court that restrained him from office. Onilu however debunked the claim by his deputy, saying;  “no court ruling has restrained me from being the National Publicity Secretary of the party. There’s no any such court judgment restraining me. He’s (Nabena) chasing shadows”. He further argued that “in the case he (Nabena) reffered to, my deputy claimed that the court restrained the party from appointing or electing Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu or any member into its top positions except through a National Convention. “For me, I am not seeking for any office that will warrant restraining the party from appointing or electing me. My office is not vacant or being contested for. I remain the National Publicity Secrertary of our great party, the All Progressives Congress,” he maintained.
