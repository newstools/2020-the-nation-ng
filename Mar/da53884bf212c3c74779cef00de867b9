 Osun State Governor Adegboyega Oyetola has hailed President Muhammadu Buhari for giving full scholarship up to PhD level to Master Akintade Abdullahi as  best overall  Young Nigerian Scientist of the Year. Abdullahi, a pupil of Osogbo Grammar School, became first in the National Examination of 774 Young Nigerian Scientists Presidential Award, organised by Federal Ministry of Science and Technology. Oyetola, who congratulated the winner and his parents, was answering questions from reporters after Abdullahi and two others were presented their award yesterday at the Eagle Square in Abuja. The governor praised the President ‘for putting measures in place to build capacity of youths through education to prepare them for their role as leaders of tomorrow’. He thanked the ministry for instituting the award to develop the interest of young Nigerians in sciences through competitive examinations. “This will enable Nigerian youths to compete internationally and become renowned laureates in sciences. Master Akintade Abdullahi Akanbi, from a humble background and a product of our public school system, becoming the Best Young Nigerian Scientist of the Year, is a testament to the quality of the public school system in Osun. “This award is a lesson to our youths that their background cannot and should not be a hindrance to their success. It is also a lesson that there is hope for the country’s public school system if we muster the political will to make it qualitative and productive. “For us in Osun, education is the bedrock and the driver of our development agenda. We are committed to providing adequate, qualitative, equitable and functional education for our children.”
