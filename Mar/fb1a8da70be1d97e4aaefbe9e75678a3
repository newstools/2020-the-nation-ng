 President Donald Trump is considering quarantining New York, Connecticut and New Jersey with a view to slowing down  the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. The aim is to restrict travel to and from the three states, which are some of the hardest-hit by the outbreak. “Some people would like to see New York quarantined because it’s a hotspot – New York, New Jersey maybe one or two other places, certain parts of Connecticut quarantined. I’m thinking about that right now,’ he said yesterday. “We might not have to do it but there’s a possibility that sometime today we’ll do a quarantine – short term – two weeks for New York, probably New Jersey, certain parts of Connecticut.” The move would help tackle the issue other states are facing where New Yorkers are fleeing the city and traveling to other states and areas, where they are potentially risking more lives and spreading the disease further afield.
