EX-LIVERPOOL striker Daniel Sturridge has been banned from football for four months for breaching betting rules. He was originally given a six-week ban last summer, four of them suspended, but the FA appealed against the findings of an independent commission. An appeal board also doubled the 30-year-old’s fine to £150,000. It was announced yesterday  that Sturridge’s contract with Turkish side Trabzonspor had been terminated by mutual agreement. Sturridge had faced various charges alleging he passed on inside information over a potential transfer in January 2018. A statement from the FA said the appeal board had ruled the commission “misapplied rules in relation to the use of inside information and made findings of fact which could not be sustained”. As a result, the board found proven two further charges that had originally been dismissed. Liverpool announced in June 2019 that Sturridge – who scored eight times in 26 appearances for England – would be leaving the club that summer at the end of his contract. He went on to score seven goals in 16 appearances for six-time Turkish champions Trabzonspor. The former Manchester City and Chelsea forward’s most recent England appearance came as a substitute in a World Cup qualifier against Lithuania in October 2017. Sturridge has been suspended from all football and football-related activity until the end of 17 June.
