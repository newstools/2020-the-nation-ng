By Oluwamayomikun Orekoya  Super Eagles duo Wilfred Ndidi and Kelechi Iheanacho could be at risk of contracting coronavirus after Leicester City manager Brendan Rodgers revealed that three of his first team players have self-isolated after exhibiting symptoms of the deadly virus. It comes after the World Health Organization designated the outbreak of the disease a pandemic. There are 484 confirmed cases in the UK and eight people have died. Top-flight leagues in Spain and Italy have been postponed, while Wednesday’s game between Manchester City and Arsenal was postponed as a “precautionary measure” as five Gunners players were in self-isolation after meeting Olympiakos owner Evangelos Marinakis. Rodgers revealed the development in a press conference yesterday saying that the affected players “have been kept away from the rest of the squad”.  Rodgers did not disclose the identities of the affected players but added that the club had “followed procedures”. Ndidi only recently returned to action after a period out with a knee complaint and was in the starting line up along with Iheanacho in Monday’s 4-0 win against Aston Villa at the King Power Stadium. The Foxes are due to play Watford at Vicarage Road in the Premier League tomorrow’s early kick-off game. “We had a few players that have shown symptoms and signs,” Rodgers said. “It would be a shame if the Watford game were postponed], but the public’s health is the most important in all of this.” Asked if the game could be played behind closed doors, Rodgers said: “The game is all about the players and the fans and if you have one of those not there, it’s obviously not the same”.
