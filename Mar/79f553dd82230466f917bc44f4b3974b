Two-time African footballer of the Year Ivorian Didier Drogba has been voted as the 7th best goal scorer in the history of the English Premier League in a poll conducted by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). The best 10 players were shortlisted from a reported poll of almost 90,000 participants before the trio of legendary Alan Shearer, Iain Wright and Gary Lineker weighed-in their opinions. Incidentally,  Shearer holds the record for most Premier League goals with 260 while  Wright scored 113 hence  they are in best positions to determine the greatest goal scorers. Drogba who spent nine great seasons at Chelsea scored 104 goals in 254 EPL matches, came behind some illustrious names in the poll that had Shearer at the peak of the rack with his record 260 goals in 441 matches. Others polled ahead of Drogba includes Frenchman Thierry Henry (175 goals/258 matches; Sergio Aguero(180/261); Wayne Rooney(208/261); Ruud Van Nistelrooy (95/149) as well as Cristiano Ronaldo (84/196). Wright said of Drogba: “The kind of player he was and what he did for Chelsea – he scored some massive goals.”
