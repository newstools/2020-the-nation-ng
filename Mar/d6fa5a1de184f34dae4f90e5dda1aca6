The Department of State Security Service, DSS, has charged three operatives of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) and three others before the Federal High Court, sitting in Lokoja, Kogi State. The NSCDC personnel, who have all been dismissed from the corps following an administrative order, include Ojonimi Samuel (40), James Ikagu and Abdulraman Omuya. Others arraigned alongside the dismissed officers, are: Abass Jimoh aka Big Man (43), Jamah Suleiman and Shaibu Abdulsalam aka Nice (43). Counsel to the DSS, Yahaya Olanrewaju, told Justice D.U. Okorowo of the Federal High Court, sitting at the Hassan Katsina Road, Crusher, in Lokoja, that the “1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants were earlier remanded at the Nigeria Correctional Service (NCS) Kabba centre, while the 4th, 5th and sixth defendants who were officers of the NSCDC were released on administrative bail, and later returned to the DSS custody. We were informed that the 4th, 5th and 6th defendants have been dismissed by the corps,” he added. The seven count charges filed against the suspects included unlawful dealing in weapons and conspiracy to commit an illegal act to wit dealing in 80 rounds of G3mm ammunition, all of which are punishable under section 27(1)(III) and such other subsections of the Firearms Act (2004).
