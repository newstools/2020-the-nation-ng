We want him to join in view of the peace we are enjoying now in the state. “If he joins, more attention would be given to the state by the Federal Government. He should join our camp. Our leader is anxiously waiting for him.” Chieftains of the APC at the gathering included the state chairman, Alhaji Surajo Maikatako as well as Alhaji Ahmed Maiaya Tsafe, Salisu Musa Kainuwa, Muzzakiru Sidi Bawa Tsafe, a Special Assistant  (SA) to the governor.
