 Chairman of League Management Company (LMC) Shehu Dikko has faulted the attitude of national team handlers towards the domestic leagues, adding that the national team selectors pay little or no attention to the home-based players. Dikko, who doubles as the NFF second Vice President, said the football house and the LMC are working out a programme where the nucleus of the national teams will be 60 per cent home-based players especially age grade teams. He said this programme would encourage our league players to play more at home while reducing the urge to rush overseas to play professional football. “I must tell you, Nigeria League is one of the best in Africa,” Dikko told NationSport. “Our players are very strong and experience. The problem is our coaches because some of them are very lazy. Other Africa coaches believe in their local players to achieve success. “But our own coaches will start camping with home-based players but few days to qualifiers or major championships , they will drop almost half of players and go for foreign-based players and most of them don’t feature regularly for their clubs. “We have now align our NPFL with international football calendar so that our players will have opportunity to play international friendlies during FIFA windows,” declared Dikko. He further stated that for Nigeria to win next Africa Cup of Nations, attention must be given to our league players by national team handlers. He explained: ” If you remember when we won 2013 Nations Cup by late Stephen Okechukwu Keshi, he gave attention to the players like Sunday Mba who made the difference. “Other countries like Egypt, Morocco, Algeria, Togo and South Africa make use of their league players for competitions. We have quality players at home it’s just that some coaches don’t believe in them or fear of criticism.  I bet you, if we had used home-based players, we would’ve qualified for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.
