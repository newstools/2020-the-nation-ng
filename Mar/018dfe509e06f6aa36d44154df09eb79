 The federal government has advised that the states in the country that have not set up Science and Technology Ministry should endeavor to do so in their best interest. The Minister of Science and Technology, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu, who gave the advice while receiving the Benue State Commissioner of Energy, Science and Technology in his office recently, noted that Science and Technology affect all areas of development. According to him, “Time has come for all states of the federation to establish science and technology in their states to the best interest Nigeria, this is so because there is no area of development that does not require Science and Technology.” Commending Benue State Government for its giant stride in establishing Science and Technology Ministry, Onu added that partnering the ministry will further move the state and Nigeria to greater height technologically.  He pointed out that over 90 percent of agricultural practice from planting, harvesting, and processing requires inputs from Science Technology and Innovation, stressing that all developed countries of the world were able to achieve greatness by leveraging on Science Technology and Innovation. The Minister stressed the need for states to partner with the FMST in areas of innovation technology in order to add value to the enormous natural resources in their domain. “Through wealth creation, government will have enough revenue to build infrastructure and generate more jobs for the citizenry,” Onu added. Earlier, the Commissioner, Dr. Godwin E. Oyiwona, appealed to the FMST to assist the state in upgrading its technology incubation centre.
