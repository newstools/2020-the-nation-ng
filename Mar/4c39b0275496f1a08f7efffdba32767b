 President of the Nigeria School Sports Federation (NSSF), Olabisi Joseph, has said that the maiden Maltina School Games has threw up talents for the country just even as she urged corporate bodies to take a cue from Maltina. The Maltina School Games involved three states, Lagos, Anambra, Kano and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja with millions of students competing from the local government preliminaries to the state finals which culminated in the National Finals held in Lagos last week at the Yaba College of Technology (Yabatech) Sports Complex with Lagos emerging as champion. Joseph called on corporate brands to emulate Maltina by supporting school sports: “From what we have seen, it’s fantastic and the kids are excited about it. We hope in the next edition we will have a larger house and the event will be bigger, that is why each of the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) were represented in the march past. “For each of the kids we have their records, we have their biometrics and we will package all the data and send it to the Federal Ministry of Youths and Sports, the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) and the Nigeria Olympic Committee (NOC). It is expected that they will be nurtured by the national coaches and in the next few years we will see these kids running for Nigeria and doing us proud,” she added.
