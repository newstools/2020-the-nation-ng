  Vanguard Newspapers last night announced the postponement of its yearly personality awards. It attributed the late decision to the spread of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) across the globe. A statement by the organisation reads: “The management of Vanguard Newspapers regrets to announce the postponement of the Economic Discourse earlier scheduled to hold today and Personality of the Year Awards ceremony slated for tomorrow. “We were constrained to postpone both events in observance of global health concern over the rampaging Corona virus pandemic, COVID 19, which is spreading to every part of the world, including our country “In observance of both federal and state governments’ instructions on how to curtail the virus and stop community infection, we had to postpone both events.”
