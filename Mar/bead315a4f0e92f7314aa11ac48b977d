 FBN Holdings Plc, the holding company for First Bank of Nigeria (FBN), and its former subsidiaries, has said the bank is considering  acquisition that will add value to the group’s businesses. In a regulatory filing at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), FBN Holdings stated that it was scanning the Sub- Saharan Africa (SSA) for  acquisitions where such would bring significant value accretion to the group. The bank noted that while inorganic growth is a major strategic consideration for all financial institutions, it will only consider any acquisition which has value accretive to shareholders and other stakeholders. According to the bank, recent events in the banking industry had thrown up merger and acquisition opportunities for banks. While not confirming any specific move yet, the bank pointed out that there will always be speculations on its involvement in mergers and acquisitions on account of its size, liquidity, systemic importance and historic support in backstopping the industry. FirstBank was responding to request for clarification after some reports suggested that the bank was making moves to acquire Heritage Bank and Polaris Bank. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had in mid 2019 indicated that recapitalisation of banks had become imperative as their current capital could no longer finance large transactions. This was taken as a signal for another round of consolidation in the banking industry. CBN Governor Godwin Emefiele said as part of the agenda of his administration, the apex bank intends to pursue a programme of recapitalising the banking industry in the next five years to position the banks among the top 500 in the world. Access Bank Plc recently acquired Diamond Bank Plc to create one of Africa’s largest retail commercial banking brands.
