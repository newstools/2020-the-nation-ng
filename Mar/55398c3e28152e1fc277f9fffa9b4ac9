 Nigeria needs about three million toilets annually to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) target of universal basic sanitation by 2030, a non-governmental organisation, Toiletpride Initiative, has said. It puts Nigeria’s current delivery of improved latrines at only about 160,000 yearly. Its Team Lead, Mr. Chukwuma Nnanna, spoke at the launch of Accelerating Access to Rural Sanitation in Nigeria (AATRISAN) Project aimed at supporting Nigeria’s effort towards ending open defecation.  He said inadequate sanitation was a major cause of diseases globally. Said he: “Inadequate sanitation is a major cause of disease worldwide and improving sanitation is known to have a significant beneficial impact on health in the households and across communities. Provision of water and sanitation also plays an essential role in protecting human health during crisis and disease outbreaks.”
