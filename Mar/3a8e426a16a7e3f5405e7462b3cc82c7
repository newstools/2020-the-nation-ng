Our Reporter Bolaji Sakin and Boubacar Samassekou were on target as Horoya beat Nigerian outfit Enyimba 2-0 at the Stade 28 Septembre in Conakry on Sunday to progress to the semi-finals with a 3-1 aggregate victory. The first leg played in Aba last weekend ended 1-1 and the Guineans finished off the work at home with a comfortable win that earns them a date against Egyptian debutants Pyramids in the last four. Nigerian forward Sakin broke the deadlock in the 27th minute with a sublime goal, curling the ball to the far post from the edge of the area after the Enyimba defense half-heartedly cleared away a corner.
