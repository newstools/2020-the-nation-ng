The Lagos State Consumer Protection Agency (LASCOPA) has sealed off Ambel Supermarket at Gbagada Phase 2, Lagos for allegedly selling adulterated drinks in pet bottles. A customer had complained of buying an adulterated drink from the supermarket after which LASCOPA’s Special Monitoring Team, led by the General Manager, Mrs. Kemi Olugbode, visited the place. The product tasted like kerosene and samples were taken for laboratory test and analysis. Olugbode, who reiterated LASCOPA’s mandate of protecting and promoting the interest of consumers against hazardous products, said the supermarket would remain shut pending the outcome of the laboratory test. She urged consumers to check products’ details before buying, and report unsatisfactory products to LASCOPA.
