 TABLE tennis legend Segun Toriola has lamented   his non-qualification for the forthcoming Tokyo  2020 Games after he faltered  at the African Qualification Tournament in Tunis, Tunisia. Tokyo 2022 will be the first time  the storied Toriola will be missing out of the quadrennial  event in the last 32 years. He  expressed satisfaction with his performance at the qualifiers, adding that he is done with playing at the Olympics. The 45-year-old partnered Olufunke Oshonaike in the mixed doubles qualification event where they made it to the final before losing 4-0 to Egypt’s Omar Assar and Dina Meshref for the continent’s sole slot. Toriola had featured the Olympic Games since 1992 Barcelona when he made his debut at 17 while his outstanding performance at the games was recorded at Beijing 2008 when he defeated top rated players to qualify for the last 16 of the men’s singles. The first African athlete to compete in seven Olympic Games after his outing at Rio 2016 told NationSport that he would surely miss the atmosphere and unique experience he has had in the last 32 years at the games. “I am going to miss the Olympics because it is special to me. I really wanted to qualify but unfortunately, I did not. Attending Olympic Games is not just about competing but the experience of meeting some of the world biggest sports stars is something you cannot afford to miss. Particularly the Games Village which is like a family house where the whole world unites without any bias,” he said. “I am satisfied with my career as it has been fantastic. For now I am not targeting another Olympic Games and it is left for the younger athletes to continue from where I stopped,” Toriola added.
