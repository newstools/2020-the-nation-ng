 DESPITE failing to take a first-leg advantage, Enyimba head coach, Fatai Osho and one of the players Austin Oladapo has remained optimistic about the team’s chances of overcoming Horoya in Conakry to qualify for the semifinal of the CAF Confederation Cup. Nigeria’s champions, Enyimba, surrendered an early lead to draw 1-1 with Horoya, who now holds an advantage heading into the return fixture of the last eight tie at the Stade du 28 Septembre. The People’s Elephant must avoid defeat and score to remain in the competition as well as a stand the chance of becoming the first Nigerian team to claim the title. Osho is, however, drawing confidence from his side’s away form, which has seen them win three of the last four in all competitions. “We stand a very good chance like I said earlier. The last time we were on an away ground we scored five goals and you want to look at that team and believe they can do it anywhere. “This is a CAF competition where you have superb officiating, so there is absolutely nothing to worry about. We still fancy our chances. I know they would like to come at us. We would be ready to really give a fight. “We just want to see how many of those players will be hundred percent because we are now thinking of taking players who are hundred percent to that particular match so that they can play to their potentials.” Oladapo added: “What happened at home wasn’t the best result for us, we know that. “I think where we missed it in the first match was the way we played. We lost our playing pattern and allowed the opponents to come hard on us. We have to stick to our pattern in Conakry.”
