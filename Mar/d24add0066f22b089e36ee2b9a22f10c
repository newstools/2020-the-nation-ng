 AN ex-convict, Ali Mohammed, on Monday said that he went back to a life of crime to raise money for his ailing grandmother. Mohammed, who pleaded guilty to stealing a woman’s handbag in a Grade I Area Court in Kubwa, Abuja, said that he fell into the temptation without thinking twice. He pleaded with the judge, Muhammad Adamu, to temper justice with mercy. But Adamu sentenced Mohammed to one year imprisonment without an option of fine, insisting it would serve as a deterrent to others who may wish to indulge in similar crime. He warned him to desist from committing crimes and be of good conduct after serving his jail term. The prosecution counsel, John Okpa, told the court that the complainant, Chinyere Akuchie reported the matter at the Kubwa Police Station on February 26. He said Mohammed criminally trespassed into the complainant’s shop and stole her handbag containing an Infinix phone valued at N45,000 on the said date. The prosecution counsel further said Mohammed  had been arraigned and convicted in Grade I Area Court, Kubwa and Upper Area Court, Zuba for similar offences in the past. He added that the offence contravened the provisions of sections 342 and 287 of the Penal Code.
