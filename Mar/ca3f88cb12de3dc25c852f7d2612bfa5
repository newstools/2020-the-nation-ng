A cleric, Pastor Temidayo Oladele, has said the security challenges and socio-economic problems plaguing the country can only be solved by a spiritual warfare. Oladele, the General Overseer of the Assembly of Prayer Ministry popularly called ‘Gbongan Adura’, said unless religious leaders seek God’s mercies and blessings through genuine prophetic prayers, Nigeria will continue to revolve around the vicious cycle of social, economic and political underdevelopment. He spoke at the Assembly of Prayer Ministry, Basiri, Ado-Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital, while burying his mother and church founder, Prophetess Felicia Olafunke Oladele, who died on January 16 at the age of 67. Pastor Oladele said: “We are talking about Boko Haram and insurgency in Nigeria because we have failed in our duties as Christians. It is our responsibility to pray for the nation and to witness to the people. “Now, we are saying Christians are the victims of terrorism because we have failed in our duty. If we had ministered or witnessed to the insurgents, they would have been a vessel in the hands of God, instead of being instruments of devil. “Let every Christian leader in Nigeria use the pulpit to preach salvation, instead of prosperity. Let’s wake up to our responsibility and make sure we win souls and pray for the nation. The more we pray, the more we will subdue terrorism and other problems hampering the development and growth of Nigeria.” The cleric eulogised his mother for her immense contributions to the spread and development of Christianity. He described her as a warm and faithful evangelist, whose way of life was consistent with her sermons. The deceased’s daughter, Mrs. Olawumi Taiwo-Oladesu, said her mother’s footprints shall remain indelible in people’s hearts. She said her mother left legacies behind, noting that she was an embodiment of faithfulness, moral uprightness and selflessness.
