 THE Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has urged the physically-challenged to stand up against corruption, in order to make the country better. SERAP Executive Director Adetokunbo Mumuni advised them not to be complacent, but to take ownership of the fight against corruption. He spoke at an enlightenment and sensitisation workshop on “Positive Social Norms among People with Disabilities (PWDs) in the Fight against Corruption in Nigeria”, organised by SERAP in collaboration with the Centre for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD). It was held in GRA, Ikeja. Mumuni, represented by Deputy Director Kolawole Oluwadare, noted that the physically-challenged were among the worst hit by corruption in high places. He said the country needed more people in the fight against corruption and encouraged Nigerians to participate in the effort to chart a new course for a nation devoid of corruption. Mumuni said SERAP would create a platform to engage all strata of disabled persons as volunteer members. “We will encourage all to be part of it and to talk to other people to fight corruption,” he said. Added he: “The platform will be a good way to do whistle blowing and expose those who acquired wealth illegally in public service.” Mumuni told the physically-challenged that the fight against corruption should not be left to the government alone. “You too have a role to play,” he said. Peter Ekemini, who represented the Executive Director, CCD, said that persons with disability were the worst hit by corruption. He said when facilities and equipment that would benefit the physically-challenged were not available because the money for them had been diverted, they (physically-challenged) would be affected. Ekemini enjoined the physically-challenged to build their capacity in laws protecting them.
