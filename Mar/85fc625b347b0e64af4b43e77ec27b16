 Manchester United defender and Ivory Coast international Eric Bailly believes Odion Ighalo’s previous experience with Watford will help Manchester United, adding that the quality the former Watford striker and fellow January transfer mate Bruno Fernandes brings to the team is great. Signed on deadline day in January on loan from Shanghai Shenhua until the end of the season, the 30-year-old striker has already made an impact for the Red Devils. Having appeared as a substitute in Premier League wins over Chelsea and Watford, Ighalo marked his first start for United with his first goal in last week’s 5-0 defeat of Club Brugge at Old Trafford in the second leg of the Europa League last-32 tie and a stunning double save from Everton’s Jordan Pickford denied him a late winner in Manchester United’s 1-1 draw at Goodison Park on Sunday. The Red Devils signed Fernandes from Portuguese club Sporting Lisbon for £67.6million, with the midfielder already scoring three goals including the equalizer against Everton. Bailly believes there is more to come from the two proven performers adding that all the team wants is for the duo to keep doing their best for the team. “You always want to have quality signings coming in and I think the signings we’ve added during the January transfer window have been really positive as well,” Bailly told United Review. “The quality they have added is great. We’ve seen in training so far that they’ve added to the squad. “Odion is a very experienced player with Premier League experience from Watford, so that’s adding good know-how to our attack. “Bruno is a real talent, a pure talent. He was voted the best player in the Portuguese league in previous seasons and we’ve seen already the quality he’s brought,” he added. “Even though he’s not used to the Premier League we’ve already seen his quality and what he can do. “They’ll just want to give their very best to the squad to help push us forward.”
