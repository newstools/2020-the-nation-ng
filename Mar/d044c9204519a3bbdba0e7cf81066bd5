The Assembly on Monday suspended indefinitely the member representing Ohaozara West Constituency, Onu Nwaonye. The House accused him of causing disaffection among legislative members and the Executive. The House handed out the suspension during plenary on Monday at the Assembly Complex Nkaliki. The motion for his suspension was moved by Leader of the House and member representing Ezza North west constituency, Victor Chukwu and seconded by Mr Chukwu Arinze representing Ishielu south constituency. Speaker of the House, Ogbonnaya Nwifuru put the motion to vote and it was endorsed by all the members of the Assembly present. Mr. Nwonye, a two term member of the House represents the Constituency of the incumbent Governnor, David Umahi. He is believed to be a close Ally of the Governor. Due to his closeness to the first family, he was seen as an untouchable and one of the cabals in the House. It was not clear if he has fallen out with Mr. Umahi and the Speaker leading to his suspension. Also the house during plenary called on Governor David Umahi to relocate Ezzangbo Animal market to a place where there will be space for them to do their business. The call was contained in a motion moved by Mr Chukwuma Igwe, member representing Onicha west constituency in the Assembly. In the motion he expressed fear that the state may lose millions of Internally Generated Revenue, IGR it gets from the market if the traders are allowed to relocate to a place in Enugu State as they were planning owing to inadequate space. He said, “the source of revenue I am referring to is the animal market located at Ezzangbo, in Ohaukwu local government area along Enugu/Abakaliki express. We are aware that this market is partly owned by individuals and government, and it is more like private owned company.”
