The National Universities Commission (NUC) and the Medical and Dental Consultants Association of Nigeria (MDCAN) met on at the National Assembly to resolve the controversy around the NUC’s circular on PhD requirement for consultants teaching in medical schools. NUC’s Public Affairs Director Ibrahim Yakassai told The Nation that the National Assembly intervened in the matter, which had “comp3elled” the consultants to withdrew their services from the various colleges of medicine. Yakassai added that the NUC and MDCAN would meet again today at the NUC headquarters to sort out the disagreement. “The NUC and MDCAN are at the National Assembly, as I speak. The National Assembly has intervened in resolving the crisis. We are meeting again tomorrow (Wednesday) at the NUC after which we will issue a press release on the matter,” he said.
