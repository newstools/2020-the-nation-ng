United States based Nigerian artist, Abass Akeju says Afrobeat genre is bigger outside the shores of Nigeria. Speaking to The Nation from his base, Akeju says, “I must tell you, it would surprise you to know that Afrobeat is very popular and loved in America and the western world. I think it is great not just for my music but other afrobeats artists too.” Though born in Ghana, Akeju readily admits to having a bias for the Afrobeats genre of music despite being exposed to various genres of music. Continuing, Akeju, who recently released a new single titled ‘Sade’ says in his career, he has featured artists that include Beenie Man, Lil Scrappy and Joey B in some of his songs. The singer also revealed that he admires many great musicians such as Nat King Cole, Bob Marley, and Fela Kuti. Aside from being a musician, Akeju is the content manager for major platforms and he is also involved in the production and distribution of African inspired content and Nollywood.
