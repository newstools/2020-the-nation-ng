  Anchor Insurance Company Limited has emerged the Insurance Company of the Year at the  Independent Newspapers Awards. Managing Director/Editor-In-Chief of the newspaper, Mr. Steve Omanufeme, noted that the selection committee recognised the company for its giant stride in the past one year, especially in its risk management and claims administration approach which have always been a source of delight for its teaming policyholders. He noted further that they were also impressed by the company’s turnaround record of performance in the last one year. The company under the new management team generated the highest premium income after 29 years of its existence, recording 72 per cent growth in one calendar year, he added.
