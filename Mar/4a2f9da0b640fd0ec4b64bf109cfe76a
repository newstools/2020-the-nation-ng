Regina Daniels has returned to movie set after what seemed like a long vacation. The young actress had been shuttling between Nigeria and several countries across the world after concluding filming her mum’s film, ‘The Enemy I Know’ and a sequel to AY Makun’s film, ‘Merry Men 2’. Daniels returned to movie set in Asaba, Delta state in February 2020 and has commenced work on a couple of productions. She was spotted on the same set with Ngozi Ezeonu filming ‘Same Blood’. Just after the production was completed, Daniels had begun work on the first production for her newly founded Regina Entertainment TV. The actress takes on the lead role of Ominili in the self titled film, which features Ejike Asiegbu, Mike Godson, Ejine Okoroafor, Patience Yisa, Moyo Lawal and Ngozi Ezeonu. It was also gathered that the production will see Daniels’ elder brother, Sammy West getting his first movie role.
