 Nigerian coach based in Switzerland, Adedeji Adeyemi Anthony, has indicated interest in handling any of the under aged national women’s team. Adedeji, who holds a UEFA B coaching license believes with his 11 years coaching experience, he’s qualified to handle either the Flamingoes or the Falconets. He has appealed to the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) to give him the opportunity to contribute to the development of women’s football in Nigeria. “I started coaching with FC Bulach, a Liga 4 women’s team in Switzerland before moving to FC Dubendorf in 2011 to 2016. I was also a coach with FC Ruti junior team in 2016,” he said. The former Stationery Stores of Lagos midfielder said he led the junior FC Ruti to win the Junior Coca-Cola League championship in 2015 and he is presently the coach of FC Winterthur U-16 team.  “In the 2015/16 season, I was a trainer in one of the best junior League called Coca Cola league U17 football club Dubendorf. I won the league that season and also lost in Cup final by penalty shootout. “Last year, I took another step forward and challenged myself by training a female team in the Bundesliga three professional league and this has prepared me to handle any female team, including the Nigeria national teams,” he said. “It’s my pride and honour to give back to my country. I am ready to coach any level of our national teams, especially the female under aged teams. I’ve had experiences at these levels,” he said.
