Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators in Nigeria (ICSAN), has given the Federal Government a pass mark with respect to adhering to certain principles of corporate governance. The body scores government high especially in the area of public disclosures of allocation to states and councils. The 27th President/Chairman of Governing Council of ICSAN Mr Bode Ayeku, who stated this at the institute’s head office in Ikeja, said though things are not yet perfect, Federal Government  should be lauded for its transparency In the aforementioned, adding that there are still much ground to be covered. Ayeku recalled how ICSAN, in sync with Federal Government, began an advocacy for the entrenchment of the principles of ethics and corporate governance across both the private and public sectors two years ago. In this respect, Ayeku challenged the masses to continually ask question on how state and local government manage allocations given to them, saying this is the only way economic development could be realised.”
