Kano Pillars defeated Dakkada FC 2-0 in one of the Nigeria professional Football league (NPFL) matchday 22 fixtures at the Sani Abacha Stadium on Sunday. Auwalu Ali and Usman Babalolo first half goals were all Sai Masu Gida needed to secure all maximum points at stake in the encounter. The win moves Pillars to 7th position as the Pyramid City outfit continue to push for top spot in the league. Meanwhile, the Kano Pillars Football Fans Club under the leadership of Bashir Idris Muazu organised a sensitisation lecture for its teeming supporters on the new laws of the game yesterday at the Indoor Sports hall of Sani Abacha Stadium Kofar Mata Kano. According to Muazu, the campaign was conducted to enhance the capacity building of the club’s supporters in order to have free atmosphere before, during and after Pillars matches. At the occasion, about N2million was realised during the launching of the 2019/2020 club’s calendar.
