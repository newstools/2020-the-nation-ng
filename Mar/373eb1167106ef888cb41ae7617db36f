A witness, Sgt. Jamilu Tanimu of Zaria City Police Division, has narrated how a pair of shoes left at the scene of a robbery, linked a juvenile to the crime. Tanimu made this known while giving evidence at the Zaria City Magistrates’ Court on Thursday. Police prosecutor Yau Garba had earlier said the case was first mentioned on February 20 against the defendants Isah Abdullahi, 17, and Mubarak Abdullahi, 17, of Unguwan Dan Madami, Zaria. The prosecution said the defendants were standing trial over alleged criminal conspiracy, housebreaking, trespass and intimidation. The witness told the court that he was assigned to investigate the case. He said on receipt of the case he went to the scene of the crime and the statement of the nominal complainant was voluntarily obtained. Tanimu said the nominal complainant said on February 6 his house was broken into by armed robbers who carted away his valuables, but forgot a pair of shoe at the house. The witness said nine days after the robbery, the first defendant, Isah, was caught stealing in a nearby house, close to the complainant’s house. Tanimu said, “During police investigation the first defendant identified the shoes and linked it to Mubarak, the second defendant. “The defendants also denied the allegations against them,” he said. Under cross-examination, the witness said the shoes were not the second defendant’s size, but had admitted that they were his during interrogation. The Magistrate, Mrs Ruqayyat-Ummi Ahmed adjourned  the case till March 26, to allow the prosecutor, Yau Garba to call his third witness.
