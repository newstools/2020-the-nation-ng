 FOLLOWING the recurring thigh injury he sustained during the African Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Tunis at the weekend, Africa’s best ranked table tennis player, Aruna Quadri has been ruled out of action for three weeks. Quadri has now been forced to withdraw from the ongoing ITTF World Tour tagged Qatar Open holding in Doha. The ITTF Africa Top 16 Cup runner’s up has been advised to rest while undergoing treatment.

But the Nigerian can still pick his spot at Tokyo based on his world rating as the 18th best player in the world. Meanwhile,  the Oyo State-born 2014 ITTF World Player of the Year expressed appreciation to fans across the world for their concern when he sustained and withdrew from the Olympic Qualifiers in Tunis. “I want to thank my family and fans across the world for their support during this trying time. Most importantly the Tunisia Table Tennis Federation (TTTF) for their prompt response when I sustained the injury. “The three weeks will help me recover and I hope to be back for Sporting in the semifinal of the ETTU Cup early next month,” Quadri said.
