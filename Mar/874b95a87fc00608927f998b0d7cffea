AWKA the capital of Anambra State will come alive as the 10th edition of the South East Cricket Championship tagged ‘Chuma Anosike Cup’ begins on March 11 with men and women teams competing in the landmark edition of the annual tournament. According to the promoter of the competition and former Vice President, Nigeria Cricket Federation (NCF), Chuma Anosike, this year’s tournament promises to be exciting and colourful. Anosike who is also the Chairman of Anambra Cricket Association explained that the tournament has achieved so much despite the challenges faced in the course of growing the game in the zone through the competition. “It is something that gave us immense joy that the tournament which started 10 years ago has been sustained and it is actually improving. When we started in 2011, only three states; Imo, Enugu and Anambra took part and there were no female participation. It was at the third edition that Abia and Ebonyi joined. “To the glory of God we have been able to move the tournament round the states and that one of the fundamental objectives, to ensure that all the states host the event. We are excited that the game has continued to grow but not as popular as football but it is definitely increasing in popularity. Some of the products of the tournament have gone on to play for various age groups in the Nigerian teams and one or two has actually been invited to the Nigerian squad,” Anosike said. He, however, commended sponsors, officials and participants for making the tournament a toast of the region and pride of Nigerian cricket, while hoping that more efforts would be done to lift the fortune of the sport in the country.
