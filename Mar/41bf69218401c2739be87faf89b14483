The Northern State Governors’ Forum (NSGF) on Sunday commended Pastor Enoch Adejare Adeboye’s impact on Nigerians as the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) turns 78 today. Forum Chairman and Plateau State Governor Simon Lalong gave the commendation in a statement by his Director of Press and Public Affairs Dr. Macham Makut in Jos. Congratulating Pastor Adeboye on his birthday, Lalong described the cleric as a man of God who is rendering fervent service to God and humanity. He added that Adeboye had been impacting on people’s lives through education, healthcare, infrastructure, empowerment and entrepreneurship using the various outreaches and programmes of the Church. “The labour of Pastor Adeboye in the Lord’s vineyard over his many years of preaching and evangelism, clearly sets him apart as a vessel of honour,” he said. According to the governor, God has used Adeboye to touch the lives of the people not only in Nigeria, but the world at large. He prayed God to grant the cleric good health and the grace as he continues to pray for the peace and progress of Nigeria, while rendering his best toward the salvation of the people.
