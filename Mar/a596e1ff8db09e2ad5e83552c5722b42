 Borno State Government has imposed a four-week ban on visitors to all Internally Displaced Persons Camp (IDPs) camps in the state. The move was part of the state’s strategy to containing the outbreak of the virus in the state. Zulum had last week appointed the Deputy Governor, Umar Kadafur, to chair a high powered multi-stakeholder response team which had all agencies of the United Nations led by the World Health Organisation and Borno’s ministries of health, education, transport, information, local governments, religious affairs and agencies involved with humanitarian affairs. The latest move, which was ban on IDP camp was announced by Chairperson of the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Hajiya Yabawa Kolo who is member of Zulum’s response team. She announced the ban during a meeting with 51 camp managers on Monday in Maiduguri.  According to her, the state took the decision as one of the strategies to prevent the importation of the virus at the camps into the state, adding that the measure became necessary as some of the neighbouring countries like Chad Republic and Cameroon has recorded suspected cases. She explained that despite closure of the borders by the neighbouring countries, there was still influx of IDPs into the state. The Borno SEMA boss directed all camp managers from Gamboru-Ngala, Damasak, Kalabalge, Banki, Bama and Monguno not to accept IDPs from any neighbouring country into their camps. She said: “We know we have a lot of threat around us following sighting of suspected cases of the virus in Cameroon and Chad and we have some border towns very close to those countries. “We do not want to go to the issue of response because even in developed countries, it was difficult for them to contain this pandemic. So at our own level, we are positioning ourselves to see how best we can stop the virus from transmitting in the state.”
