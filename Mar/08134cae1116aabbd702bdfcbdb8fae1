 GENERAL Overseer of Royal Place Ministries International Texas, United States, Bishop Blessing Samuel, has assured that the coronavirus pandemic will disappear just as suddenly as it emerged. He appealed to Christians not to lose hearts but trust God to see them through. He asserted that what the world is going through is a trying time though difficult to bear for everyone all over the world, stating that faith rather than fear should be the watchword. Bishop Samuel assured there is hope in the hopeless situation, declaring the development is not the end of the world. “This is just a trying time. Coronavirus is not just a virus, it is a demon trying to kill our faith and also close churches but God will fight for His people. This viral virus will soon disappear the same way it came,” he reiterated. The cleric advised everyone to take preventive measures, stating even “doctors and scientists may be confused but God is not confuse, help is on the way.” He added: “I believe strongly that the demon has been destroyed and solutions shall be found quicker than the doctors anticipated. “Stay safe and be prayerful, having faith in God to see us through. I encourage all Nigerians, religious bodies and everyone in the world not to ignore the laws and instructions of the government. Also to join hands in the mission to rescue the nation system from collapsing.’’
