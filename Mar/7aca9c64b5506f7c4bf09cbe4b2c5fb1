Residents of the Kogi State capital, Lokoja, on Saturday ignored governmentâ€™s stay- at- home directive as part of measures rolled out to protect them from the coronavirus pandemic. The government had on Friday announced that it would shutdown the state as from Saturday as a measure to contain the spread of the dreaded coronavirus in the state. The commencement date of the directive, which fell on the weekly market day and also being the last Saturday of the month, for which the government had announced the observation of its environment sanitation day, witnessed huge turnout at the Kpata market, even before the close of the clean-up exercise. The Chairman of the Squadron Committee set up by the Governor Yahaya Bello to enforce compliance, Mr. Edward Onoja, who doubles as Deputy Governor, had on the previous day declared wide ranging measures to keep the state safe from COVID-19. The Nation however observed that activities in the state remained as usual as shops remained open with trading activities in full swing in all the markets visited. At the Lokoja International market, even though all the entrance gates remained under lock, the roads were awash with traders as they displayed their ware and carried on with their trading activities. There was some level of compliance at the Old market during the period of the monthly sanitation exercise between 7am and 10am. But the traders were to later open their shops immediately after the exercise. Many shop owners in the metropolis opened for business as usual. Some of the traders, who spoke with The Nation, said that they were not aware of the shutdown order by the state government, adding that they needed to earn their daily living.
