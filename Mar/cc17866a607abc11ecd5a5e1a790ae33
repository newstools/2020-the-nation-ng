 EX-FOOTBALLER and current chairman of Surulere Local Government, Tajudeen Ajide has lauded the quality of players in the Ajide U20 Football Championship which comes to a close today with the final match between Puma FA and Ify Babes at the Legacy Pitch of the Lagos National Stadium. The sponsor of the tournament said: “I have seen quality players here and the good thing is that they are young too. We have penciled down their names and this is what we want so as to add our quota to the development of youth and grassroots football in the country. In fact, most of these players are in secondary schools students.” Hon. Ajide also praised the organiser Association of Proprietors of Football Academies of Nigeria (APFAN) for putting together a great tournament. Similarly, ex-international Tajudeen Disu, thumbed up the tournament for throwing up genuine U20 players. “What I have seen are assemblage of genuine U20 players and I want to applaud the organizers and sponsor for doing the right think. The matches have gone without hitches and protest because everyone recognizes that these players are not overage.” Meanwhile, Puma Football Academy and Ify Babes will battle for the winner’s trophy in the final of the tournament. To move into the final, Puma FA defeated FC Phoenix 2-1 in the first semi-final played at the Hockey Pitch of the National Stadium, while high-scoring Ify Babes beat another tournament revelation Banjoh FA 4-2 to get the second final ticket. The second match was particularly interesting with flurry of goals coming in the second half after the first half finished 1-0 in favour Ify Babes. The third place match between Banjoh FA and FC Phoenix comes up before the final. President of APFAN, Dr. Francis Akinremi, disclosed that the winner and first and second runners up, top scorer and most valuable player would be handsomely rewarded.
