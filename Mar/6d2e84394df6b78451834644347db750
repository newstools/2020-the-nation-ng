HUNDREDS of churches across South Korea appeared to go ahead with religious services on Sunday, despite a government request to cancel them. Church leaders asked worshippers to stand metres apart and to wear face masks, the state news agency Yonhap said. The country’s culture minister met church officials at a large Protestant church in the capital Seoul, and repeated an earlier call for religious leaders to move church services online. South Korea’s leaders have warned several times that they will have to impose stricter quarantine orders if South Koreans ignore government advice to avoid large gatherings. Seoul has recorded 98 new cases of the virus over the past 24 hours. This is down from a high of 909 new infections which were confirmed in one day in late February.
