No fewer than 49 persons bagged First Class from different departments at the Nnamdi Azikiwe University (NAU), Awka. Prof. Charles Esimone, Vice Chancellor of the University disclosed this at a news conference heralding the 14th Convocation Ceremony of the institution on Monday. Esimone said a total of 2, 821persons would receive post graduate honors including 339 doctorate degrees while 6, 750 would be awarded their degrees at the ceremony. The VC said Alhaji Sanusi Lamido Sanudi, Emir of Kano, Chief Innocent Chukwuma, Chairman of INNOSON Motors and Chief Daniel Chkuwudozie were among eminent Nigerians that would be conferred with honorary doctorate degrees for their contributions to education and society. He congratulated the graduates and urged Nigerians to join in the week-long programme which would last from March 9 to March 13. Esimone dismissed the rumour that there was increase in tuition fee of the university, adding that what was done was the aggregation of all fees and levies. He said every form of collection of money from students by departments, faculties and studentâ€™ union dues was now illegal. According to him, all what the student should pay was built into the tuition as students are better off under the current dispensation. (NAN)
