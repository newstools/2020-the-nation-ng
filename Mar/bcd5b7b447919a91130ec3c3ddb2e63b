Speaking with CAMPUSLIFE, Dr Amzat explained that the grant has been used to acquire digital equipment for the furtherance of learning and research in the department. He said: “The academic equipment is for the lecturers, one desktop for each lecturer in the department for teaching and research.  He, however, noted that the development would help in furthering UDUS’ mandate to rank among the 21 century ivory towers. He advised other lecturers to work towards getting external sponsorship for their departments. “The equipment only serves one department,” Amzat noted. “The idea is that if every department has one or two resource person who can attract grant, then the university can fulfill a part of its mission of becoming a 21st Century ivory tower.” The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation is established by the government of the Federal Republic of Germany.
