Transportation Minister Rotimi Amaechi has said he was unaware of the alleged sack of the Director-General of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Dakuku Peterside. There was an unconfirmed report that President Muhammadu Buhari approved the appointment of Bashir Jamoh as the new DG of the agency. Jamoh is the executive director of administration and finance at NIMASA. Peterside’s tenure expires on March 10, 2020. On the alleged sack of Peterside and his replacement by Jamoh, he said: “I am not aware. As of yesterday, when I spoke to the DG of NIMASA, he was in the office and they had a board meeting and he was present at the meeting. “I am not aware that he has been removed. I spoke to him at about 3 pm to 4 p.m. I should know if he has been sacked. If I am the minister of transportation, I should know. “Maybe we need to call him (Peterside) this morning to know whether or not he is in the office. But the government does not take an arbitrary decision….” On the speculation that his alleged sack might be due to the failure of the agency to audit its account for six years, the minister said: “I am not aware that that could be the reason… “The President has the right to appoint whoever he wants to appoint and if he wants to extend his tenure, he will extend his tenure.”
