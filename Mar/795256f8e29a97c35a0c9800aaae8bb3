Fire on Tuesday gutted Owode market in Offa, Offa Local Government Area of Kwara State. The fire, allegedly caused by power surge, destroyed about 20 shops. Spokesperson of the Fire Service Hassan Adekunle said the quick intervention of fire officers saved the market from being raised down completely. “The intelligence unit of the state fire services is working to know the immediate and remote causes of the inferno, but we cannot rule out electric spark,” he said. A trader, Alhaja Halima Saka, lamented the incident and called on the government to come to their aid. The Offa Descendants’ Union (ODU) expressed shock over the inferno. Spokesperson Maruf Ajenifuja said: “The extent of the inferno is yet to be ascertained, but the union has deployed relevant officials to the scene for more details. “ODU has asked the government for new fire trucks and an upgrade of the fire service station, but we are still awaiting a positive response. “We hope our governor will accede to our request. We also pray that God will console the victims.”
