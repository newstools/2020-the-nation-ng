The move which  is part of the efforts of the Chief Judge to decongest the five prisons in the state will close Thursday. Titled, “Notice on Correctional Decongestion Exercise”, the notice signed by the Chief Registrar of the High Court of Lagos State, it stated that the gesture is limited to inmates who have been in custody for a period of two years and above without trial. The request which is being made “in preparation for the next Nigeria Correctional decongestion exercise” is also directed to members of the bar. Relations whose family members are awaiting trials are expected to forward to the chief registrar information such as : “ Names of parties; High Court divisions and Number/Magistrate Court District and number; Suit number/Charge number; Status of case; next adjourned dates and number of years awaiting trial.”
