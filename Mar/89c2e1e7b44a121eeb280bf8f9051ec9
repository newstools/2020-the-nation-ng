  TRADERS at Ladipo Market in Mushin, Lagos Mainland at the weekend implored Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to build a pedestrian bridge at Toyota bus stop. The traders, who spoke during the general market sanitation, said that the bridge was necessary to prevent them from being knocked down by hit-and-run vehicles. Speaking during the exercise, the President- General of the market, Mr. Jude Nwankwo, said that the day was set aside to keep the market clean, noting that it would enable customers to come and buy motor spare parts in a conducive environment. He said: “Coronavirus is not good for us, hence the need for us today to close the market, clean the environment and clear our drainages. Our members must regularly clean and sanitise their environment, wash their hands and ensure their shops are always clean, thereby making the market conducive for all. “All the 47 units have been sensitised on the need for continuous sanitation and the need for all to have hand sanitisers.” He appealed to Governor Sanwo-Olu to assist them in evacuating their refuse and hailed him for road construction ongoing in Lagos. The Environmental Chairman, Mr. Nonso Chiufo, said that the cleaning was necessary to make the market cleaner and more conducive for traders and customers. “The exercise tagged: ‘Ladipo must be clean’, was designed to meet the standard of cleanliness the state government expects from us. We will sustain this. The traders have been sensitised on the continuity of the cleanliness. We don’t want the market to be shut because of dirtiness,” he said. Chiufo said that the traders had been educated on Coronavirus, adding: “We have told them that it is important for them to wash their hands regularly and apply sanitisers. “We have protected ourselves and the environment. Today’s cleaning is extraordinary and will be sustained. Task force will go round the market to apprehend those who refuse to partake in the clean-up. They will be penalised.”
