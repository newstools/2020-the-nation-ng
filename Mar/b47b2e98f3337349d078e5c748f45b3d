The absence of the Chairman of the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT), Umar Danladi, on Tuesday stalled the trial of former Acting Registrar-General of Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC), Azuka Azinge. Azinge was arraigned at the tribunal on December 23, 2019, on 11 counts bordering on breach of the code of conduct for public officers. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that no reason was given for the judgeâ€™s absence. Tribunal officials told the counsel that a date would be communicated to them. NAN reports that Azinge is also accused of receiving allowances she was not entitled to as an acting Registrar-General of the CAC. She pleaded not guilty when the charges were read to her on December 23, 2019. NAN reports that on December 28, 2019, the CCT ordered the suspension of Azinge, pending the conclusion of her trial on charges bordering on the breach of the code of conduct for public officers.
