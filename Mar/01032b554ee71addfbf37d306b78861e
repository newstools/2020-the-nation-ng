Rosatom, Russia’s state run nuclear energy corporation, has proposed the use of Small Modular nuclear Reactors (SMR) to address the perennial power shortage that plagues most African nations, especially Nigeria. Acting Chief Executive Officer, Rosatom, Central and Southern Africa, Mr Ryan Collyer, was said to have made the submission at the Africa Energy Indaba forum, held in Cape Town, South Africa. Addressing stakeholders from across the continent, Collyer, highlighted the global shift toward nuclear, not only in the energy sector but also to address a myriad of other issues. He also stressed on the possible use of nuclear technologies for desalination purposes apart from heat and electricity supply. According to Collyer, adoption of Small Modular Reactors can be a good alternative to diesel generators providing reliable power supply and preventing harmful emissions at a competitive price. Shedding light on ROSATOM’s advancements in SMR technology, he informed delegates about Russia’s RITM-200, an advanced pressurized-water reactor that incorporates all the best features from its predecessors. Collyer highlighted the main advantages of RITM-200 reactor to include: cost-efficiency, small size and safety. Russia’s RITM-200 reactor, he noted, was designed for nuclear icebreakers, land-based small Nuclear Power Plants and floating nuclear power plants. According to him, ROSATOM has already constructed six RITM-200 nuclear powered reactors with two onboard Russia’s nuclear powered Arktika icebreaker. Collyer further disclosed Russia was working on the next generation of the offshore nuclear power plants as an optimised floating power unit (OFPU).
