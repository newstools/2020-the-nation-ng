Residents of Ebrumede, Uvwie council area of Delta State on Monday woke up to the shocking sight of a beheaded female body near the popular Vita Foam office, along the ever-busy DSC Expressway. The Nation gathered that the body may have been deposited at night by suspected ritualists. About five poles across the scene is the Ebrumede Police Station. This reporter visited the scene and saw the naked body lying in the middle of the highway.  There was no blood on the floor to indicate that it may have been a car crash. A wrapper which had been used to cover the body had been blown away, while a table obstructed the corpse to prevent incoming vehicles from crushing it. A commercial tricycle rider said the body must have been deposited around midnight. He said, “A few minutes to 10pm  when I passed this route last night (Sunday), the body was not there. Recall that a madman, suspected to be a ritualist, was in early December 2019, burnt to death by an angry mob for reportedly possessing a human skull and mobile phones, by the Otokutu Bridge which is also along the expressway. It was observed that another mad looking man, currently roams the same Otokutu Bridge. Motorists confirmed that he appeared out of the blue since February. Efforts to get comments of the council chairman, Hon Ramson Onoyake, proved futile as calls put across to his phone line, rang out.
