Dr Lawrence Abada, a Medical practitioner in Estate Clinic, Benin, says eating of fruits can boost the immune system and fight against diseases. Abada disclosed this in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Benin. “A healthy immune system reduces your chance of viral infection and flu. With natural fruits to boost the immune system you can achieve a healthy immune system. “The immune system is the first line of defence of our body against an alien microorganism entering the body. The stronger your immune system the less will be your chance of falling ill. “With little change in your diet and routine you can ensure that your immune system is strong enough to protect you against the coronavirus infection. “Instead of taking soft drinks, take fruits. You can also make natural fruit juice. “The saying, “an apple a day keeps the doctor away” can actually be true as consumption of vitamins can boost your immune system. “Vitamin A, B6, C, D and E can help increase the strength of the immune system. Vitamin C is the biggest booster of all and lack of it can cause several diseases including scurvy. “You can get Vitamin C from citrus fruits like Orange, Grapefruit, Spinach and Strawberries. “You can take multivitamin supplements from your doctor, however, natural intake through food is the best way to boost immunity,’’ he said. He advised all to ensure the boosting of their immunity during this period of the corona virus pandemic. (NAN)
