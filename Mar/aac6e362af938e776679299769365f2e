  Nigeria’s men and women basketball teams – D’Tiger and D’Tigress will have to wait to know their group opponents for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games in Japan as the basketball draw for the Games have been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. As the continent’s sole flagbearers in the men and women basketball events of the Olympic Games, Nigeria were supposed to know their opponents tomorrow but the draw will be on hold till the COVID- 19 pandemic is under control. According to FIBA, the delay will affect not only the organisation of the group stage but also the scheduling of pre-Olympic exhibitions (friendlies) and the choice of venue for each of the games scheduled.  Three weeks ago the International Olympic Committee (IOC), spearheaded by its longest-serving member, Dick Pound, noted there could be a potential postponement or cancellation of the lauded event due to this pandemic. The IOC gave a two-to-three-month window to gain clarity on the matter, considering events were scheduled to start at the end of July — putting late May as the latest time for discussion. Tokyo is still planning for the event as usual, now that some Asian countries have managed to contain the outbreak lately, and many expect things to go back to normal in the coming months as the virus runs its course. Iran’s men’s basketball team has qualified for the competition after 12 years.
