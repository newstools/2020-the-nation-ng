 What’s hotter this season than denims? Denims are synonymous with fashion, though a specific fabric rules per season. But in all, the denims just like black stand the test of time as the all-season fabric and colour, be they for night gigs or daytime events. It’s so interesting the various ways you could wear your jeans. Jeans have come a long way and they seem to have come to stay too. It is no longer just a casual outfit as it can be combined with other clothes to give formal or informal look.  For office wear:  Long-sleeved shirts tucked in on straight jeans with  pencil-heel shoes would not be bad for corporate look, especially when you want to appear smart.   Saturday is usually a day to look forward to. You just want to look your own style. Even if you have to go to the office on Saturday, make your outfit different from what it has always been. Fly your shirts on your jeans. You wouldn’t be fired for it. It’s weekend.
