Following a meeting with the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF), La Liga has announced the indefinite suspension of professional football in Spain because of the coronavirus pandemic. The league said in a statement on Monday that it would not resume until the Spanish government says it is safe to do so. “The Monitoring Commission established by the current RFEF-La Liga Coordination Agreement AGREES [to] the suspension of professional football competitions until the authorities of the Government of Spain and the General Administration of the State consider that they can be resumed without creating any health risk,” the statement read. “Both the RFEF and La Liga wish to express our greatest public gratitude to all those who are dedicating their best efforts to provide essential services to the Spanish people and also share our condolences for all the deceased and a warm embrace from the world of soccer to the many families that are losing loved ones.” Spain’s top flight was initially postponed for two game weeks on March 12, with previous plans to play matches behind closed doors scrapped as the coronavirus crisis in the country worsened. Things have not improved since then, with Spain struggling to deal with the spread of the virus.
