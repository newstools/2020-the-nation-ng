This is not a good time for Oluwo of Iwo, Abdulrasheed Akanbi. While he is still battling with the media attention created by the split with his Jamaican wife, Ms. Chanel Chin, he found himself in another saga. After allegedly assaulting another traditional ruler, Agboowu of Ogbaagba, Dhikrulahi Akinropo, over a land dispute, the Osun State Council of Traditional Rulers suspended him for six months. His first reaction was to dismiss the suspension as a mere audio pronouncement, but later he said he took it in good faith even though it was harsh. Last weekend, Oloja of Epe Land, Oba Kamorudeen Ishola Animashaun, celebrated 20 years on the throne in style in Epe, Lagos, and it was not hard to notice the Oluwo’s absence. All his royal and socialite friends gathered to celebrate the Oloja amidst fun and razzmatazz. Sources said the reason for the Oluwo’s absence could not be far from his recent saga, which has made him unpopular among fellow traditional rulers. For the one-week traditional event, the grand occasion where dignitaries where given a special treat was held at the Epe Recreation Ground. Fuji maestro, King Wasiu Ayinde Marshal, was there to do what he knows best to do. Dignitaries at the occasion were Lagos State Deputy Governor, Dr. Obafemi Hamzat, Oba Saheed Elegushi, Hon. (Mrs.) Yinka Babalola, Hon. Toyin Akerele, Hon. Bola Olumegbon Lawal, Hon. Tobun Abiodun, Sir Kessington Adebutu, Chief Folu Oguntade; Hon. Prince Bayo Balogun, Hon. Segun Olulade, Chief Jide Odekunle, Otunba Deji Osinowo, Ològe Yaya Busari, Prince Gbolahan Animashaun, Hon. Tajudeen Olayemi Ajala, Otunba Lekan Osifeso, among others.
