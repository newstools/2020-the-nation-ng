Ekiti State Commissioner for Information, Muyiwa Olumilua, said on Tuesday that the bill for the Ekiti Security Network Agency and Amotekun Corps pending before Governor Kayode Fayemi would be signed into law next week. The bill, awaiting Dr. Fayemi’s assent, was passed by the House of Assembly into law on February 14 after passing through normal legislative process, including the first and second readings as well as public hearing. Olumilua said the Amotekun bill remains top priority of the Fayemi-led administration, adding that it will be committed for executive assent next week for effective implementation. “The bill is going to be signed next week. I can’t give you a specific date, but all I know is it will be signed into law early next week,” he said.
