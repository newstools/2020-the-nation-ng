A suspected assassin, Moses Okoi, 28, was on Monday arraigned before a Lagos Magistrates’ Court sitting in Igbosere for allegedly attempting to kill a female pastor, Janet Ogunsola. Okoi, who had been on the run since October, 2019 was arrested by operatives of the Federal Special Anti-robbery squad (FSARS) on Adeniji Adele Road, Lagos Island. He was accused of conspiring with two others, already on trial, for attempting to kill the female pastor. Prosecuting counsel, CSP Charles Onwumere told the court that Pastor Benjamin Akinsanya, 56, in charge of the Life House Ministry at Ojo, Lagos allegedly sponsored Okoi and others still at large to eliminate Ogunsola to stop her spiritual popularity over him in church ministry in Ojo area of Lagos. Other suspects already facing trial alongside the pastor over the alleged crime were Darlington Oriji, 25, and liberty Elvis, 20. Following the arrest of Okoi, the police consolidated the charge sheet and re-arraigned him with the pastor and two others yesterday before the Igbosere Chief Magistrate Court, Lagos on a four-count charge bordering on attempted murder before Magistrate A A Famobiwo. CSP Onwumere further alleged that Pastor Akinsanya  paid the suspects N500,000 to kill the female pastor in charge of Glorious Chapel Ministry located at 1, Adeleye Street, Ojo, Lagos to stop her soaring spiritual popularity over him in the area.
