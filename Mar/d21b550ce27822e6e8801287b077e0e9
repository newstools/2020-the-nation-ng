 Born Jibril Anifowoshe, JayBleeng is eyeing the zenith in the music industry and there is nothing that can stop him from achieving his dream. His new album, ‘Bed of Roses,’ has been attracting attention since its release. For instance, a track, ‘Begging for Your Love,’ has won the heart of many music lovers. He told Social Circuit that his latest single explained what it meant to be madly in love. The singer said: “The reviews from ‘Begging for Your Love’ have been absolutely phenomenal as the song speaks for itself. I believe in quality music, which is good for entertainment purposes. However, I intend to inspire people, raise issues people don’t want to talk about, take people’s mind away from the regular day to day struggle and try to put smile on the faces of people with music. “The stage is my playground. Performing in shows is beautiful because it brings out the energetic aspect of me. I connect with the fans with my charisma. I just love entertaining in general.” Although he is based in America, JayBleeng is not far from Nigerian and African music. He has performed in Ogun State, Lagos Island, Ibadan, Ghana and Cameroun. He has a Bachelor’s degree in Economics and Cyber Security from the University of Missouri, St Louis, United States.
