 THE Nigeria  Customs  Service  (NCS) and  the National  Agency  for Food, Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) have restated commitment to the fight against smuggling of drugs and other harmful pharmaceuticals. Speaking at the resumed destruction of tramadol and other prohibited/fake drugs worth N14.7 billion at Oke-diya dumpsite  in Sagamu, Ogun State, Chairman of the Joint Committee, Victor Dimka, said smugglers would continue to suffer huge losses if they continue with such imports. Dimka, the Comptroller, Enforcement of the NCS, described the seizures  made  in  different  parts  of  the  country  as  a proof  of uncompromising commitment to enforcement by Customs and NAFDAC officials. He reiterated the charge by Comptroller-General of Customs, Col. Hameed Ali, to officers of the Service to shun compromise and strictly enforce the law on anti-smuggling. He commended the cooperation customs is receiving from NAFDAC,  Nigerian  Army  and  other  government  organisations, describing it  as  a  good  example  of inter-agency  cooperation between sister government outfits. “This destruction is in continuation of the exercise we started on 24th July, 2019, involving 58 containers of illicit drugs seized by our men. After the Lagos exercise, we shall be going to Port Harcourt and Kaduna to continue with the destruction” he said. Dimka added that thevolumes of drugs seized so far are capable of causing  health  hazards  and damages  to  addicts  who consume  them abusively. Eearlier,  Col. Ali, who was represented by Assistant Comptroller-General, Zone A, Mrs. Katharine Ekekezie, blamed importers of the drugs for several drug induced sicknesses like cancer, renal failure and heart failure.
