 The Presidency has described a video being passed around on social media platforms as an attack on President Muhammadu Buhari in Kebbi State on Thursday as ‘a work of mischief makers’. It would be recalled that a video of a young man, seen charging towards the President, who was in a line up for a photograph snapshot, along with other dignitaries, in Kebbi on Thursday, went viral. The scene was passed off by some social media users as a physical attack on President Buhari by an angry Nigerian. However, in a statement issued late Thursday night by Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr Femi Adesina, the Presidency said the young man seen in the video was indeed an enthusiastic youth, who was too excited to hold himself back, seeing his President in the flesh. It, however, described the narrations being spread on social media platforms as a work of contortionists and malicious minds, calling on the public to ignore the story. “President Muhammadu Buhari was in Kebbi State Thursday to declare open the Argungu Fishing and Cultural Festival. It was the first time the international tourism event would hold in eleven years, as security considerations had rendered it impracticable. “As the President went round the arena to inspect rice pyramids on display, and take photographs with farmers, a young man was so very excited to see his President so close. He made an attempt to get to him. “World over, such would not be allowed by security details. The young man was prevented, and he protested that he should be allowed to greet his President. Now, professional contortionists are making mischief of the event. They are passing the video clip off on social media as an attempt to attack the President. “Malicious people always twist things to give a negative narrative. But they simply dash their heads against the wall. The country moves on”, the statement said.
