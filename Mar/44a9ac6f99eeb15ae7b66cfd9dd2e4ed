A mini-tournament to decide the Champions League and Europa League will be one option put forward to ease fixture congestion caused by the coronavirus outbreak. European football’s governing body, UEFA, is hosting a video conference with major stakeholders today. A source close to the situation said all parties must be ready to sacrifice something to reach a solution. All 55 UEFA members, the boards of the European Club Association and the European Leagues, and a representative of world players’ union Fifpro have been invited to Tuesday’s meeting. The UEFA members will also hold an additional meeting to discuss their own reaction.  Also, a decision over whether to postpone football’s Euro 2020 by up to a year, with all the sporting and financial consequences that would entail, is set to be made when UEFA holds a crisis meeting today  as Europe battles the on-going coronavirus pandemic.
