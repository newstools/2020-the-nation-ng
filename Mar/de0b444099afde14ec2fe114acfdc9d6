The Chinese Ministry of Commerce (MOC) on Wednesday said the outbreak of coronavirus would not affect the Chinese food market. An official of the ministry, Mr Wang Bin,who made the disclosure at a news conference, said that food sales had picked up by 9.7 per cent, but that people now preferred take-away packs. According to him, the period has also witnessed increase in the sales of protective gear, health and sanitation products. “New consumption and retail models including “contactless” pick-ups and live-streaming are gaining momentum while emerging sectors such as artificial intelligence are burgeoning against the broader consumption downturn. “Affected by the outbreak, retail sales of consumer goods, a major indicator of consumption growth, declined by 20.5 per cent in the first two months of this year, down 28.7 per cent. “Hotels, restaurants, barber shops, departmental stores and shopping centres were among the hardest-hit, with far fewer customers since the outbreak,’’ he said. Bin expressed optimism that China’s consumption growth would be stronger as soon as the government’s policies to boost consumption were implemented. He also said that the epidemic would not affect the trend of long-term stability and continuous upgrade of China’s consumption. (Xinhua/NAN)
