 AT its 89th National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting during the week, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) opted to rationalise its staff at its National Secretariat in Abuja. Unknown to many, the party has been trying to survive since the conclusion of the 2019 general elections. Before the poll, all manners of aspirants and candidates picked the party’s bills with slush cash. Strategy meetings were also held by the party in Dubai (UAE), London and in the United States of America. The permutations of those throwing cash around was that the party will soon be in power to recoup their investments. But the first sign of the cash crunch came from a South-South governor whose candidate lost the presidential ticket of PDP. The aggrieved governor has since withdrawn his financial support for the party because he felt betrayed. Although the party’s presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, stepped in with his war chest to bail out the party for many months, he was said to have lost the steam as the sole financier. Now, PDP is financially gasping for breath and the innocent staff will have to bear the brunt.
