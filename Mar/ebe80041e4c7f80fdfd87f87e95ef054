By Adekunle Yusuf  To address coronavirus in a more proactive manner, the Ogun State government has called on its public servantsto join hands with the Governor Dapo Abiodun administration in spreading the gospel of personal hygiene across their various communities. This, in a way, would dispel every form of fake news and fear appeal making rounds about coronavirus, the government said. The Commissioner for Health, Dr. Tomi Coker, who made this appeal at the sensitisation programme organised for civil servants at the Arcade Ground at the state secretariat at Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta, said  the role of government workers in their communities of residence could not be pushed over. Coker urged the people to stay calm and ignore panic messages being sent out by some mischievous elements, assuring that government is on top of the situation.  She said the simple rule of hand-washing practice should be adhered to, adding that coughing and sneezing into the elbow or tissue paper should be embraced by all and that such tissue paper should be disposed immediately after use. “I want to plead with all government workers to remain calm. We are on top of the situation. It is my sincere pleasure that you being our foot soldiers should take the message of regular hand-washing and sound respiratory practice to our various communities, schools and offices,” Coker said. The Team Lead, African Region, World Health Organisation (WHO), Prof. Bola Olayinka, called on the public to be mindful of touching surfaces in different places, affirming that germs can be contracted without notice. Also, the Director of Public Health, Ministry of Health, Dr. Festus Soyinka, admonished workers to ensure they use alcohol-based sanitiser accordingly without equating it with the importance of soap and water.
