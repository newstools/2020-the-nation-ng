Our Reporter  A mini durbar will be held in Kano during the 44th Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the National             Association of Nigerian Travel Agencies (NANTA) scheduled from the 25th to 28th of this month. The durbar, according to the chairperson of the organizing committee, Mrs. Susanne Akporoye , is to be held to showcase the rich tourism endowment Kano is known for and also reassure tourists of the normalcy in in many parts of the North like Kano.  This was disclosed during a pre-AGM press conference in Lagos.  The outgoing NANTA President Mr. Bernard Bankole used the opportunity to take about the progress the association has made in the last four years during his tenure. He said: “we worked tirelessly to showcase NANTA as the apex and very progressive private sector of the travel and tourism institution, a feat unequalled in many ways. As president and team leader, we roused NANTA from near-death and gave vision and aspiration that has restored the dignity and future for travel trade professionals and to the glory of God, kept the entire tourism and travel sector in focus.”
