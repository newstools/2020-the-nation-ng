AFCON 2019 top scorer, Odion Ighalo will pocket N26.5m for his four goals and three wins as well as a draw since joining Manchester United from Shanghai Shenhua. The Nigerian is being rewarded for his fine start to life at Manchester United with some huge bonuses, according to The Sun of UK. The former Watford striker took a pay cut of 40 per cent on his mega £300,000-a-week contract with Shanghai Shenhua to move to Old Trafford in January. Ighalo was so desperate to join United, the team he supported as a boy in Nigeria that he was willing to see his salary noticeably reduced. However, he has already started to make up the deficit after a number of lucrative bonuses were included in his deal with the Red Devils. According to The Sun, Ighalo pockets £8,000 (N3.4m) for every goal he scores and £9,000 (N3.8m) for each Premier League win United pick up when he’s part of the matchday squad. He has already scored four times since arriving in January – twice in the FA Cup and twice in the Europa League – to earn himself £32,000 (N13.7m). And after appearing off the bench in three top-flight victories and a draw against Everton worth £3,000, the Nigerian has added another £30,000 (N12.8m) to his bonus total. Since joining Manchester United, Ighalo has pocketed £62,000 (N26.5m) in bonuses for his goals and the wins for the Red Devils. There is no bonus for a defeat, but the 30-year-old is reportedly in line for a sizeable payment if he helps United finish in a Champions League position. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men are currently fifth in the table, three points behind fourth-placed Chelsea who occupy the final spot. Ighalo and his team-mates have not played since their 2-0 victory over rivals Manchester City on March 8 due to the coronavirus crisis, but the Premier League hope to resume games in May and complete the season.
