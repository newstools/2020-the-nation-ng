The World Athletics Athletes’ Commission on Thursday said it welcomes the decision from Japanese Government and the International Olympic Commission (IOC) to postpone the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games to 2021. A statement on the website of the athletics governing body stated that the decision provides the clarity that athletes sought against the backdrop of COVID-19. It also allows athletes to focus on staying healthy and helping combat the unprecedented global pandemic. ”We understand that many questions remain unanswered, and as we move forward, we will continue to work closely with World Athletics and other athlete groups in our sport to provide answers to those questions. ”To that end, we have begun working with World Athletics to explore the possibility of providing athletes with competition opportunities this year, provided that it is safe to do so. ”Additionally, we expect to be part of the review process of the current Olympic qualification system, and will ensure that athletes’ concerns are taken into consideration before any amendments to that system are implemented. ”At this time, we ask athletes to follow the recommendations of their governments and health authorities by staying home and practicing social distancing to safeguard the health of those around them. ”Together we can be part of the solution, and when the time comes, be the beacons of inspiration through athletics that our world will need,” the statement read in part.
