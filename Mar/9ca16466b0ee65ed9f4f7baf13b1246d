MANCHESTER United forward Odion Ighalo hopes to be back playing football in three weeks after Premier League football was initially postponed until April 3 due to the coronavirus pandemic. The overwhelming sentiment is that a return will not likely be before May, with a Premier League emergency meeting set to take place on Thursday to establish plans for the remainder of the season. Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta says he is already recovering from Covid-19 having tested positive on Thursday, a diagnosis which was the catalyst to the Premier League season’s suspension.  Chelsea’s Callum Hudson-Odoi also tested positive for Covid-19, and is recovering well in isolation. Ighalo on Saturday took to Twitter to deliver a hopeful message of a quick return. “See you guys in 3 weeks, pls [sic] be safe,” said the 30-year-old. The striker arrived at United on loan from Chinese Super League club Shanghai Greenland Shenhua in early February and was initially ineligible to play, having to self-isolate under the government’s precautionary procedures. Meanwhile, Odion Ighalo has been named in the UEFA Europa League team of this week. UEFA released the Europa League team in a post on its official website on Friday.
