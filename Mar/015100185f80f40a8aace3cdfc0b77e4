Victor Osimhen has praised Lille’s ‘solid performance’ in their 1-0 victory against Lyon in Sunday’s Ligue 1 game. The Super Eagles star featured for the entirety of the game as Loic Remy’s strike ensured the Great Danes extended their winning streak against the Kids. The victory at Stade Pierre Mauroy saw Christophe Galtier’s men maintain their fourth spot in the table after gathering 49 points from 28 matches. “Another win and solid performance from the whole squad,” Osimhen posted on Instagram. Osimhen has been in fine form since his summer move from Sporting Charleroi, scoring 18 goals and providing six assists in 38 appearances across all competitions. The 21-year-old will hope to produce a goal scoring performance when Lille takes on Brest in their next league game on Saturday. The youngster is expected to lead the attack when Eagles take on Sierra Leone in the two Africa Nations Cup qualifiers in Asaba and Freetown. The Super Eagles are leading Group L with six points after victory against the Republic of Benin and Lesotho.
