 THE Coca-Cola Foundation continues to reiterate its commitment to empower women in Africa through specific “In-Country” developmental programs, executed in partnership with credible non-governmental organisations. TCCF awarded a $66,000 grant to Lagos based NGO; WhiteField Foundation to implement its capacity building and upskilling programme tagged: ‘S.H.A.P.E 2020.’ The acronym, which stands for “She Has Ability, Position & Equip Her” is Whitefield’s women focused intervention which commits to train and equip “at-risk” and “underserved” women in local communities with transferable skills such as catering, cosmetics, fashion designing, soap making etc. The grant allows Whitefield to expand the program to 600 participants and also empower over 100 of the women with tools of trade with which they can set out on their journey out of poverty. Whitefield Foundation has trained over 5000 women and youth in different skill-acquisition programmes over its 17 years of existence. Speaking at this year’s programme launch, the Public Affairs, Communications & Sustainability Manager, Coca-Cola Nigeria, Nwamaka Onyemelukwe noted the Foundations commitment to empower and invest in women, maintaining that the awarding of the grant is in line with that objective.
