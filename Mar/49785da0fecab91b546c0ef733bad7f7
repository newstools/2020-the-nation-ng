 After picking one of the four slots available in the women’s singles to Tokyo 2020 at the Africa Olympic Qualifying Tournament, Offiong Edem has admitted that the Tunis qualification was a bit more difficult for her than others. Edem who was unbeaten in the final qualifying matches where she defeated Ethiopia’s Marta Gulti, Tunisia’s duo of Fadwa Gacri and Abir Haj Salah to top the group and confirm her spot at the 2020 Olympic Game in Tokyo, Japan told NationSport that she could not sleep for days before the qualification. “I must say that this is my toughest qualification particularly when I was playing the second match against Tunisia’s Fadwa Garci,” explained Edem.“ I was leading 3-1, and things then started to change as I could not get my rhythm again in the match. “ My mind was just on the qualification for the  Olympic Games. This has been a player that has never given me a threat before in tournament. But before I could know what was happening she had levelled up at 3-3.” She continued: “After the sixth game, I just told myself that I must be focused and take my mind away from the Olympic Games and just play my game. This helped me a lot in the last match and I played with nothing bothering me.” Edem, who made her debut at Sydney 2000 in Australia, expressed her delight over the qualification, promising to work harder to make her presence felt in Tokyo. “I am going to go back to my base and train well and ensure that I keep fit which is very key. I will also make sure I compete in several tournaments as I would not be going to Tokyo as a participant alone but make my impact in the women’s singles event. There is no doubt that I am still in cloud nine over this qualification as I am yet to get over it,” Edem added.
