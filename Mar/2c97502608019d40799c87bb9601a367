 Four timber dealers and a women have been abducted by gunmen in a boundary community between Ondo and Edo State. The victims were said to be indigenes of Ondo State. A community leader from Akunu Akoko, Michael Bello, said the timber dealers went to the forest on Saturday with a lorry owned by a saw miller based in the community. Bello said the lorry broke down on their way back and some gunmen emerged from the bush and abducted them. The woman, who hawks cooked rice, was taken along the four timber dealers while returning to her camp. It was gathered that the kidnappers have not contacted family members to demand for ransom.  A source said soldiers were already combing the forest to ensure their release. Area Commander for Ikare Akoko, Razak Rauf, an Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), said the area where the incident occurred is not within the jurisdiction of Ondo State police command. The regent of Akunu Akoko, Princess Tola Orogun, said she was sad about the high rate of insecurity in the area which shared boundary with Kogi and Edo states. Princess Orogun said many indigenes of the area are scared to visit home due to incessant robbery attacks.
