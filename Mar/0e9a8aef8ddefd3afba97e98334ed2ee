Nigerian  midfielder Lanre Kehinde who currently plays in the K League 1 for Incheon United has said that he is making plans to return to Europe where he experienced the best time of his career. The 25-years-old who started his career with Dominion Hotspur and later joined Kwara United on loan before moving to Maccabi Tel Aviv in 2012, stated that he has enjoyed his stay with  Incheon United but was ready for another challenge in European football. “I must say that I have actually enjoyed playing in Korea since I joined Incheon United last year,” stated the 6ft 4 1/2 in tall player, who scored 20 goals in 32 appearances for Israeli second division outfit Hapoel Afula in the 2014/15 season. “It is good to experience a different culture but it is now to time move back to Europe,” The former Ankaragücü of Turkey player said that his manager Lim Wan Sup and coaches Park sung Chul and Joong Yong Lim have helped shaped his career but emphasised the need to return to Europe. He said: “I have the ability to do well at any top club, all I need is the opportunity. I proved what I could do in Israel and Turkey and hopefully playing in mainstream Europe will enable football fans in Nigeria see and appreciate the talent I have. “This is the crucial time in my career. At my age, I should be looking for a transfer that will help develop my career and put me in contention for a place in the national team. It is not easy to become a success but I am ready to continue to do my best and boost my profile as a player,” the stocky midfielder added. Since his breakout season in 2012, Kehinde  who scored 10 goals in 15 appearances for Denizlispor of Turkey in 2019, has totalled 58 goals in his club career and he is hoping to take that form to his next club in Europe.
