Our Reporter  Youth and Sports Development Minister  Sunday Dare has offered scholarship to  a five-year- old boxing sensation Ayomide Adeyemo. Dare’s grassroots development agenda had led to the discovery of young boxer Shekinat, a swimmer nicknamed Fish and the Yakubu sisters dubbed the Williams sisters of Nigerian tennis for their prowess on the tennis courts. Dare who refers to himself as the ‘Chief Talent Hunter’ said he was moved by a viral video of the young talented boxer.  “Sequel to the viral video of a talented baby boy boxer in the social media, I will be putting the baby in a boxing academy for further growth and also sponsor his education. Some financial stipends will be given for the upkeep of the lad as well,” Dare said. In line with Dare’s vision of ensuring that athletes combine sports with education, Olamide will be training after school  under the tutelage of his father Adeyemo acting as his trainer.
