Davido has featured his fiancee, Chioma Rowland in a music video again. Chioma first appeared in one of Davido’s music videos, ‘Assurance’ in 2018. Davido had said in various interviews that the song, ‘Assurance’ was dedicated to his partner, hence the reason for featuring her in the video. In the same vein, Chioma has appeared as the major vixen for Davido’s new music video. The video is for ‘1 milli,’ one of the songs off Davido’s sophomore album, ‘A Good Time’, which was released in 2019. The music video for ‘1 milli’ has many similarities with the video for ‘Assurance’ as both Davido and Chioma kept displaying public affection throughout the 3-min long video. Davido and Chioma got engaged in 2019 after Davido proposed to the pregnant culinary expert. The singer and his fiancee welcomed a son together in 2019 and have hinted fans plan to tie the nuptials in 2020.
