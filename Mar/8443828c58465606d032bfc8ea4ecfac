The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has passed a vote of no confidence on the Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of Council, Dr. Wale Babalakin, calling for his removal. The union passed the resolution at a congress held at the University on Wednesday during which it declared him a persona non grata and warned him to steer clear of the campus. ASUU-UNILAG Chairman, Dr. Dele Ashiru told The Nation that the Union would enforce its resolution, urging the Federal Ministry of Education (FME), Abuja to remove him, claiming he had caused more harm than good. They accused him of causing the suspension of the university’s 51st convocation scheduled for March 9-12, 2020 by misrepresenting the situation to the FME. Babalakin wrote to the Education Minister, Dr. Adamu Adamu on March 2, 2020, claiming the University Authorities got no approval from the Council for the Convocation programme. Ashiru said: “We are asking the Federal Government to remove Babalakin as Pro-Chancellor because our union is going to enforce that resolution. Babalakin cannot be seen anywhere on this campus from today.  WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
