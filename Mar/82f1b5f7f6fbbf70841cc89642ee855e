 PIGGYVEST has hosted a panel at the ongoing 2020 Social Media Week in Lagos. The company’s hosting was on the second day when the firm hosted a panel that discussed “Wealth creation in this digital age”. The panel was moderated by Piggyvest’s Vice President Products, Layo Ogunbawo and had as panelists: Sola Adesakin Chief Executive Officer, Smart Stewards, Ayo Bankole (Lagos SME Booth Camp Convener), Kayode Oyewole and  co-founder and partner, Venture Platform of Piggyvest, Odunayo Eweniyi. Eweniyi emphasised monetising the digital space as a means to wealth creation. “Your product, skill, or service needs to find just one unifying factor that everyone is excited about to grow digitally,” she said. A finance expert Adesakin spoke about the four types of wealth that customers should all be interested in – financial wealth, fit wealth, time wealth and social wealth. She shared useful insights on the three M’s of money – make money, manage money, and multiply money. On the other hand, Chief Technology Officer, AppConnect, Ojimaojo Udale-Ameh, unveiled new updates to the Piggyvest app at the event. These were designed to build on the pre-existing yet exciting functionalities Piggyvest users are accustomed to. On the list of what it means to be a millennial is financial consciousness – what to do with money, when to spend it, what to spend it on, and particularly how to make more. Wealth creation is an ongoing conversation that would continue for as long as financial independence remains a primal goal for almost everyone to reach.
