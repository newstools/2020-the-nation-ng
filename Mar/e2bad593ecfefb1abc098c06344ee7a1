HE ran for deputy governor. He lost. He became a candidate by illegal means. Victor Giadom and his sponsors did not follow the rules, and they ended up falling disgracefully at the polls. No, they fell before the whistle, because they did not even qualify. INEC blew the whistle, and Giadom and his friend Tonye Cole were not there to race. They wanted to triumph with impunity. It seems impunity is in Giadom’s spirit. Now he wants to be the party chairman. A man who has resigned from the National Working Committee wants to eat his cake and have it. He wants to chair a body of which he is not a member. He resigned to pursue the impunity in Rivers. He failed there and he is doing same at the centre. Impunity can only beget impunity. A vector of impunity. He is bearing failure like a halo and flag, and his backers should realize that APC is now under an undertaker’s care. Some of the anti-Adams forces who don’t want him have made him the thorn to divide the party dividers. If Giadom does not have it, his supporters will not yield. It gets tougher for the rebels. The implosion has just had its first tremor. If they think the party will survive the removal of Adams, they should beware. The party will slide into the mortuary. President Buhari should watch the rascals in his party.
