 Although there is still no clear picture as to who will succeed the late Oba Idowu Oniru of Iruland, who joined his ancestors last year, Aremu Adesegun Oniru fancies his chances. The only person in his way is Chief Security Officer to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP) Hakeem Ajasa, who also has many supporters. Last year, the former Commissioner for Waterfront Infrastructure Development in Lagos State had a big all-white birthday celebration at Ilashe Beach, Lagos. D’banj, Mayegun Wasiu Ayinde, CDQ, Skales, M Real were some of the celebrities at the party. But it was a different case this year. In celebration of his 54th birthday few days ago, Adesegun held a low-key celebration at Timeless, Victoria Island, Lagos. It was attended by family and close friends. Social Circuit gathered the kingship tussle could be a major reason Adesegun opted for a quiet celebration as his mind has been preoccupied with the desire to be the next Oba of Iruland. Adesegun is the first son of the late Oba Idowu Oniru. He was also one of the most active members in former Governor Babatunde Raji Fashola’s cabinet.
