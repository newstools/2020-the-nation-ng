Moses Emorinken, Abuja The federal government Thursday launched the Nigeria health workforce country profile and the national health workforce registry, which will ensure that health workforce information, is readily available for evidence-based management and planning. The reports, which were done, in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Global Affairs Canada, revealed that an additional 3,806 medical doctors were professionally registered with the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria (MDCN) in 2018. The numbers increased from 70,737 in 2017 to 74,543 in 2018. The current registry has health workforce information from 10 states, namely: Bauchi, Cross River, Anambra, Sokoto, Adamawa, Borno, Abia, Osun, Niger, and Edo. Other states are either at the data entry or data verification level, while Yobe is yet to commence. From the report, in 2012, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) had the highest density of 82 medical doctors per 100,000 population, whereas that of Katsina reduced from 2.5 per 100,000 population in 2012 to 2.0 per 100,000, and Zamfara increased marginally from 2.5 per 100,000 population to 2.7 per 100,000 population. Concerning the trend in external migration of medical doctors, although there was a decline from the numbers recorded in 2007, there is a progressive increase in the numbers from 656 in 2014 to 1,551 medical doctors applying for letters of good standing or verification standing (a proxy for migration) in 2018. Registered Dentists with the MDCN totaled 4,358 in 2018. This stock equates 2.12 dentists per 100,000 population, (a ratio of 1: 47,079 dentists to 100,000 population). Also, 3,198 registered dentists were in good standing in 2018 with 44 percent being females. There were nine accredited dental schools in Nigeria as at December 2018 and they produced 172 dentists. The number of registered nurses in 2018 was 180,709. This equates 88.1 nurses per 100,000 members of the population (nurses to population ratio of 1: 1,135). For registered midwives, the number was 120,870. This equates 58.9 midwives per 100,000 members of the population (midwives to population ratio of 1:1,697). The report, however, noted that the density of midwives reduced by 1.7 percent from the 2012 density of 59.9 per 100, 000 population to 58.9 per 100,000 population in 2018. In 2018, 24,668 pharmacists were registered with the Pharmacists Council of Nigeria (PCN) and this equates to 12 pharmacists per 100,000 members of the population (pharmacist to population ratio of 1:8,317). For medical laboratory scientists, in 2018, there were 29,246 medical laboratory scientists registered with the Medical Laboratory Science Council of Nigeria (MLSCN). This represents a 40 percent increase from 717 in 2012 to 922 in 2018. The report noted that the number of medical laboratory scientists increased at a much faster rate (average of 7 percent) than population growth rate. The number medical laboratory scientists in 2018 equates to 1 medical laboratory scientist per 100,000 population (medical laboratory scientists to population ratio of 1:101,670). The Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, in his address during the launching in Abuja, said: “The government of Nigeria, through the Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH) has been working on obtaining accurate data on the existing health workforce in the country in order to facilitate human resource for health planning and thereby deliver efficient, effective and high quality health services to its citizens. “This effort is part of the nation’s response to WHO’s call to all nations of the world to strive towards the attainment of Universal Health Coverage and Sustainable Development Goals through the implementation of the Global Strategy on Human Resources for Health (GSHRH) 2030”. According to the Officer-in-Charge of WHO Nigeria, Dr. Clement Peter, “The journey of having a comprehensive and functional registry is very timely considering the need to plan for the health workforce in the country in view of the health indices in the recently released Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey 2018. “Current registry has health workforce information for 10 states; there is a need for Government of Nigeria and partners to support the scaling up of the registry to cover the remaining states in the country as well as the Federal Departments, Agencies and Parastatals, and the private sector”.
