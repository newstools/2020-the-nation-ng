 NIGERIA’s Industrialist and Founder, BUA Group, Abdul Samad Rabiu, has donated N1 billion to support ongoing efforts to contain pandemic Covid-19. He has also placed order for additional equipment and medical supplies, including testing kits and medical protective gear to nine states in Nigeria. The beneficiary states are Lagos, Kano, Adamawa, Edo, Kwara, Rivers, Abia, Akwa-Ibom and Sokoto. Speaking on the donation, Rabiu said that it was very important for the private sector to support the government’s effort to curb the spread of the Coronavirus pandemic adding that the N1 billion donation will be done through the Central Bank of Nigeria-led “Private Sector Coalition Committee against COVID-19”. “This donation will not only provide additional needed funds to the government and NCDC’s efforts but will also serve to protect healthcare and medical workers on the frontlines of fighting the pandemic. In addition to donating the ordered medical supplies and equipment to the two most populated states in Northern and Southern Nigeria, we have also selected seven states across all geopolitical regions in Nigeria where significant members of the BUA workforce and their families are situated to help preparedness and response to the challenges posed by the pandemic. Each of these nine states will receive about 100,000 protective facemasks, 1000 high grade medical protection and isolation gear, 2000 protective goggles, 1000 gloves and 1000 testing kits amongst other things.” Rabiu said. Meanwhile, APM Terminals Nigeria has contributed N75 million towards the United Nations in Nigeria basket fund, which aims at mobilising resources to boost the efforts of the government in addressing the Covid-19 pandemic.
