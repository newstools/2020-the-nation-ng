JUVENTUS forward Cristiano Ronaldo has not tested positive for coronavirus, the president of Madeira has confirmed. The Portugal international is currently quarantined on his home island after it was revealed that Juventus’ teammate Daniele Rugani had contracted the respiratory illness. Italy are the European nation most affected by the outbreak, meaning that Ronaldo is expected to remain in Madeira for the foreseeable future. There were fears that the 35-year-old would also be tested positive for the infection, but Miguel Albuquerque said in a statement that the attacker has been given the all-clear. “I cannot speak of this issue for data protection reasons, but I want to say that the situation has been properly analysed and it is, at this time, guaranteed that there is no possibility of infection,” said Albuquerque. Ronaldo had initially flown home to Madeira to visit his mother, who suffered a stroke earlier this month.
