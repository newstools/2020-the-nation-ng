Clinic Matters star, Naomi Nkechi Amara has kicked against being body-shamed by fans. Amara, who is known as Nurse Titi in the popular sitcom, warned fans not to come to her Instagram page to body shame her . The actress made the warning after a follower compared her former look before marriage to her present look. “That’s the Titi we adore so much but of recent she’s grown so fat,” the fan wrote. The comment which did not go well with the actress had her replying, “You have no right to come to my page to tell me how I look. You are not my husband and have no single right to say that! Next time I wouldn’t sound this nice. Be warned and this is also a warning/advice to others out there.” In 2017, the actress announced her engagement after which she relocated to Europe where she currently lives with her family.
