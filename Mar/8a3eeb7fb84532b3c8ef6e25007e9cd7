IN light of the current global pandemic, we would like to extend our heartfelt gratitude and appreciation to you all for your unwavering support. As you can understand, the SMO office is closed, and we will be working remotely. Of utmost importance to us is the safety and wellbeing of our community, both physically and emotionally, and we wish you strength and peace through the weeks to come. We are reminded in these times of the therapeutic power of art; its ability to uplift, inspire, unburden, and rejuvenate the mind and soul. As we weather through this, stay connected with us through our Instagram, Newsletters, and Website, where we will be putting out engaging and behind the scenes content on art – the process, as well as art in unchartered times. Stay safe, encouraged, and inspired, and we look forward to seeing you all soon when the tide subsides. “And the people stayed home. And read books, and listened, and rested, and exercised, and made art, and played games, and learned new ways of being, and were still. And listened more deeply. Some meditated, some prayed, some danced. Some met their shadows. And the people began to think differently. And the people healed. And, in the absence of people living in ignorant, dangerous, mindless, and heartless ways, the earth began to heal. And when the danger passed, and the people joined together again, they grieved their losses, and made new choices, and dreamed new images, and created new ways to live and heal the earth fully, as they had been healed.”
