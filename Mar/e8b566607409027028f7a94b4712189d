The police in Katsina State have alerted the public on the latest tricks of kidnappers: phone calls and text messages in which they threaten to kill or kidnap people or their relatives if they fail to pay ransom. The alert was contained in a statement released by the command’s spokesman Gambo Isah on Tuesday in Katsina. Gambo said, “It has come to the notice of the police that some people have devised new tactics of calling or sending text messages to friends, neighbours, relatives or acquaintances, claiming to be bandits or kidnappers from the forest. “They ask people to pay them ransom or risk either themselves or any member of their families being kidnapped. The police warned anyone nursing such ideas to desist because death by hanging is the punishment for kidnapping.
