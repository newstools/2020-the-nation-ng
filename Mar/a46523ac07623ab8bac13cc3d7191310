A chieftain of the APC, , has dismissed insinuations that he has defected to the Action Alliance party, saying: “I’ll not leave the house I contributed to build’’. Adjoto, who is Special Adviser to Gov. Godwin Obaseki of Edo on Parliamentary Affairs, made the clarification in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday in Benin. He said there was no basis for him to leave the APC for another party, noting that he and other progressives had made remarkable contributions to bring the party to reckoning. Adjoto described insinuations that he had dumped the APC for another party as “fake news fabricated by his detractors to bring him to disrepute’’. The special adviser said that he had to make the clarification to set the records straight so that such fake news would be put to the dustbin by members of the public. “I decided to clear the air on the matter because the recurring false narrative was becoming a source of concern to my teeming supporters. “The fake news is a failed attempt to bring my name into murky waters of political hysteria. This has been the stock in trade of the fake news peddlers. “The fabricated tale was even given a spice that I had gone ahead to lobby for chairmanship position in the said party. “These elements, who are only relevant during political upheavals will stop at nothing to throw spanner in the wheel of peaceful resolutions as advocated by the leader of our party, President Muhammadu Buhari. “For the umpteenth time, I remain a proud and ideological member of the APC with no iota of intention to defect to another political party. “I’ll not leave APC now or in the near future,” said Adjoto, who was also the immediate past speaker of the Edo State House of Assembly.
