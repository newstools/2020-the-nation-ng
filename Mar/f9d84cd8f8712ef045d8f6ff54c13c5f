The Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, Mallam Abba Kyari, has announced his Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) status as being positive. Mallam Kyari, who disclosed this in a message made available to State House Correspondents Sunday night, also said he would be leaving Abuja for Lagos same Sunday night for medical treatment. He, however, made it clear that the cost of his treatment would be from his private purse, adding that he believed he would be back at his desk soon to continue his service to the President and the nation. While he admonished all Nigerians to heed all the advice so far given on how to prevent contacting the disease, especially the advice on personal hygiene and cleanliness, he warned against taking quack advice, many of which he said are replete on the social media. He explained that he had not felt any symptom of sickness, but had remained in isolation since his result returned positive last week. “I am writing to let you know that on medical advice, I will transfer to Lagos later today for additional tests and observation. This is a precautionary measure: I feel well, but last week, I tested positive for coronavirus, the pandemic that is sweeping the world. I have followed all the protocols government has announced to self-isolate and quarantine. “I have made my own care arrangements to avoid further burdening the public health system, which faces so many pressures. “Like many others that will test also positive, I have not experienced high fever or other symptoms associated with this new virus and have been working from home. I hope to be back at my desk very soon. I have a team of young, professional, knowledgeable and patriotic colleagues, whose dedication has been beyond the call of duty, who continue to work seven days a week, with no time of the day spared. We will continue to serve the President and people of Nigeria, as we have for the past five years. “I want to thank all our fantastic, talented and brave healthcare professionals, working across the country in such a difficult time; all the good Samaritans looking out for the most vulnerable in our communities; the key workers that will keep our country going through this; friends and family and often strangers, who have sent me such warm wishes and displayed such a generosity of spirit. “We should be calm, measured and diligent – be meticulous in your hygiene, especially with cleaning hands, if possible stay at home or keep your distance. Listen to good advice from the proper authorities: pay no heed to quack cures or fake news from social media. “President Buhari will do whatever it takes to protect the health and safety of our people and get the country back on its feet as soon as possible. “Like the whole world, we are dealing with a new disease. Our experts are learning more all the time about coronavirus, what it does and how we can combat it. What we do know is that while some may become very sick, many others who contract the virus will not, and may have no symptoms at all. This is a disease that recognises no difference between north and south, men or women, rich or poor. We are all in this together,” he said.
