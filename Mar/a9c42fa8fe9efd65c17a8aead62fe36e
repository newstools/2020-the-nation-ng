 A former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Chief Austin Opara, has stated that the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) will win the Edo State governorship election on September 19 this year. Opara, who supervised PDP’s local government congress across the 18 local government areas of Edo state, said this on Sunday in Benin City, in an interactive session with reporters. The former deputy speaker, an Ikwerre from Rivers state, who is aspiring to succeed Governor Nyesom  Wike in 2023, declared that the governorship candidate of his party would replace Governor Godwin  Obaseki of the All Progressives Congress (APC) this year and ensure good governance. He said: “The PDP is getting stronger in Edo State. I can tell you from what we have done in the state. PDP can only come out stronger in 2020. “I want to seize this opportunity to tell members of our party (PDP) that though they cannot get all that they want, where there are areas of disagreement they should give and take, but we are almost there. “PDP is ready for the forthcoming governorship poll in Edo State. Indeed, we are waiting for the PDP to take over the state.” Opara described PDP’s local government congress across Edo state as peaceful and exciting.
