Even when he decides to take a back seat, which may not come anytime soon, stylish Adetokunbo Modupe will always be remembered for bringing class and professionalism to Nigeriaâ€™s public relations sector. On Monday, Toks, as fondly called by close pals, celebrated the day he was born, 51 years ago. Although the paparazzi were absent, he still found a way to celebrate with his staff at TPT International, family members and close associates. While he is optimistic that his best is yet to come, Mopdupe was grateful to God for seeing him through in his professional and personal endeavors, as well as for His divine protection over the years.
