The First Lady, Mrs. Aisha Buhari, has called on banks to review the interest rates on loans for private hospitals. She said health indices of Nigeria, when compared to global expectations were discouraging, because there are not enough public or private health facilities to cater for the people, especially the most vulnerable. Mrs. Buhari spoke when the Guild of Medical Directors visited the State House, in Abuja. She said private hospitals play a strategic role. She appealed for tax incentives to reduce the cost of healthcare. Mrs. Buhari  said: “I commended the patriotic zeal with which doctors carry out their duties, in some cases even at the cost of their lives. Let us observe a one-minute silence for the repose of the soul of the late Dr. Ameyo Adadevoh, who lost her life while saving an Ebola patient in Lagos and two other doctors that died while saving the life of a Lassa fever victim in Kano; these doctors displayed a high sense of patriotism. “I call on Nigerians to be vigilant and observe the stringent prevention and control measures against the novel corona virus (COVID 19), which has become a pandemic. “We are meeting today at a time when the entire world is being confronted by the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and I would like to use this opportunity to urge you all to be vigilant and to observe the appropriate infection prevention and control measures for your safety and that of others.”
