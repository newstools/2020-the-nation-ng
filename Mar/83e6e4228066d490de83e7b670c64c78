 AS part of activities marking the International Women’s Day, Harriet Thompson, the Deputy British High Commissioner to Nigeria, hosted guests to an exclusive screening of the movie, CHATROOM, produced by Peju Ibekwe. The movie was produced to help women who are affected by domestic violence to break their silence and start the process of healing. Speaking at the event, Mrs. Peju Ibekwe, the producer of the film said she was motivated to produce it because of the remarkable increase in the number of violence recorded against women in the last three years. According to her, the project started since 2016 and was supported by the Bank of Industry and Sterling Bank. She said there are many families that are suffering in silence as a result of domestic violence, remarking that until they speak out about it, they will not come out of it. “So they need to get into the Chatroom to unburden the loads in their hearts. We are doing this so that our children can have proper fathers and mothers in the future,” Mrs. Ibekwe said. The Chatroom is based on a TV reality show where Ebiere, one of the contestants, hopes to escape the haunting ghost of her past deprivation, although fate has a different, intriguing and far-reaching thrust for her. The movie is highly entertaining and filled with a lot of humour and laughter without losing the message. Some of the leading actors in the film are Odunlade Adekola, Tony Umez, Akpororo, Ronya Man, Nengi Adoki, Omawunmi Megbele, Sambasa Nzeribe, Damilare Kuku, Vivian Anani and Rykardo Agbor among others. Veteran broadcaster Adesuwa Onyenokwe appears in a cameo role in the movie and is also an Associate producer of the movie.
