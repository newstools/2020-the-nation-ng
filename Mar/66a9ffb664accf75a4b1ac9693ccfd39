A 44-year-old surveyor, Mr Sheriff Ahmed on Monday urged an Igando Customary Court, Lagos, to nullify his seven-year marriage, over wife’s alleged romance with a policeman. The petitioner alleged that his wife, Rashidat, with whom he had two children, was promiscuous, adding that she was dating a police officer. “I checked her phone, and I saw her love chats and other immoral talks with the policeman on WhatsApp. “We fought over it, I wanted to send her packing but due to intervention from friends and relatives, I forgave her.” Ahmed accused his wife of dressing in an indecent way, saying “My wife dresses like a prostitute; she wears clothes that are not fit for a married woman. I have begged her several times to change her style of dressing, but she refused. Rashidat moves with women of questionable character; women who are wayward and no longer in their husbands’ houses.” He also said that his wife was fetish, adding that he saw a charm inside her bag, when he was looking for his phone charger. “I found a charm in her bag; when I read what was written on it, I discovered that it was a command charm to extort money from men.” The petitioner urged the court to end the marriage because he was no longer in love with her. Rashidat welcomed the divorce, and accused her husband of battery. The court President, Mr Adeniyi Koledoye, adjourned the case until March 17 for judgment.
