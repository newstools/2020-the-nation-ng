By AbdulGafar Alabelewe, Kaduna  There was pandemonium at the Medium Custodia Centre Kaduna on Tuesday, as inmates revolted over a rumoured case of COVID 19 in the centre. Our correspondent gathered the inmates started uprising, demanding to be released from the congested centre. Unconfirmed report also has it that an awaiting trial inmate who was brought into the prison recently was infected with COVID 19 and had infected two other inmates, who were as at Tuesday showing symptoms of the virus. It was however gathered that, personnel of the centre had a tough time, including firing of shots to calm the fraying nerves of the inmates. But Controller of the Kaduna Command of the Correctional Centre, Sanusi Muazu Danmusa, told our correspondent that there is no suspected case of COVID 19 in the centre. Our correspondent, who visited the centre to confirm the rumoured outbreak of COVID 19 and the comotion in the prison, observed the Independence Way was blocked directly in front of the Centre, with barricades and vehicles of the State security outfit, Operation Yaki. But the Controller, who was at the Prison gate at the time of the visit, said what happened in the centre was a mere misunderstanding, which is normal. According to him: “We only had a mere misunderstanding and we have resolved it. Our environment is now peaceful and calm. “There is no suspected case of COVID 19 in Kaduna Convict Prison, whoever is carrying such is carrying a mere rumour. To the best of my knowledge and as far as I know, there is no case of COVID 19 here. “Nobody enters this place, except you are a staff and even the staff, we wash and sanitize our hands before we enter and the people who work here do not go out until they close.” The Controller also said there was no casualty in the fracas that ensued.
