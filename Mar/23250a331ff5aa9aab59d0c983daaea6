 The National Youth Service Corps(NYSC) has suspended group bio-metric clearance for corps members because of the deadly coronavirus. The scheme also suspended the weekly  Community Development Service meetings of corps members because of the disease. The NYSC noted that these are proactive measures aimed at containing the spread of Coronavirus among corps members. The Director-General, Brig. Gen. Shuaibu Ibrahim, stated these in a statement by the Director, Press and Public Relations of the NYSC, Mrs. Adenike Adeyemi on Friday in Abuja. Ibrahim said the NYSC has taken adequate precautionary steps towards ensuring that all corps members are safe. He said the scheme has put in place measures that would ensure that corps members do their monthly clearance seamlessly at their Local Government Offices without forming clusters. The statement reads: “We have suspended the bio-metric clearance and Community Development Services. “We want to appeal to our Corps Members to be conscious of their health and avoid places with large number of people. “The safety of our corps members is our priority.” Ibrahim said as soon as the situation improves across the globe and in the country, the 2020 Batch ‘A’ Stream One corps members would be recalled to camps to complete the remaining activities of the orientation course. He urged the corps members to follow periodic briefing from the Federal Ministry of Health and Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, including directives from the NYSC management which would be made available on its social media platforms.
