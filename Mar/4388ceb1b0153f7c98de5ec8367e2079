 The Nigeria Olympics Committee (NOC) in conjunction with Nigerian University Games (NUGA) will organise an Olympic Value Education Programme (OVEP) for Nigerian University Athletes. With Sports becoming a global phenomenon in the last three decades, characterized by increasing rivalry among participating athletes and nations, the NOC deemed it fit to help in inculcating the Olympic Spirit in Nigerian athletes in the various universities which is a constituent of the International Olympics Committee (IOC). “We have recognized the emerging danger amongst sports men across the world hence our decision to initiate the Olympic Value Education Programme (OVEP) to protect the sanctity in sports participation and effectively contribute to building a peaceful and better world,” NOC Secretary General Olabanji Oladapo stated. “We need to keep educating youths on how to practice sport without discrimination of any kind, in the spirit of friendship, solidarity and fair play in line with the Olympic spirit.” The first edition to cater for schools in the South West end today Lagos State University will end today, while the South East and South South Zones will hold its own at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka from April 6 to 9. Those in the Northern part of the country will converge in Abuja from April 4 to 7 with six athletes from 10 universities from each of the six geo-political zones taking part in the programme.
