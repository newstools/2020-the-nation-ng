The Aisha Falode-led management committee of the Nigeria Women Football League has announced the postponement of the official kick-off of the 2019/2020 Nigeria Women Premier League following the failure of 12 out of the 16 participating teams to comply with requisite regulations leading to the league kick-off. According to a statement signed yesterday in Abuja by NWFL’s  Chief Operating Officer  Dr. Ayo Abdulrahman, the 12 clubs failed to submit evidence of up-to-date payments of players’ wages and also failed to submit reports of comprehensive medical test on each of the registered players. Abdulrahman noted: “There is no way we can start a new season without the clubs offsetting owed salaries of players so as to start the new season on a clean slate.” He added: “With the present situation in the Nigerian football league, where medical certification of players has become an integral part of football administration in the country, we cannot turn a blind eye to this. The reason we had no choice than to insist on the medical certification of each of the players registered for the new season.”
