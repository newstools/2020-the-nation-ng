A 28-year old man has told police that he killed his Facebook friend because he was insistent on having anal sex with him. The incident reportedly happened in Nanka, Orumba North council of Anambra State Angus Chukwebuka Nwankwo and a relative Chidiebere Omeyi were among over 100 suspects paraded weekend at the police headquarters in Amawbia, Awka South South Local Government Area of the state. Nwankwo said he met the deceased on Facebook where they agreed to meet in Nanka for homosexual acts. He said, “We met on Facebook and he asked if I could engage in homosexual acts with him and I said no, but after much pressure I succumbed. He promised to give me N20,000 if I had sex with him. As soon as he came in, I asked for the money and he said he would give me the money after he satified the urge, which brought him all the way from Imo State. “I insisted he must pay me  the money he promised. That was how a fight started. He was the first to hit me with a stick and I fell down. My younger brother who was with me held him down while I  picked up the stick and hit him and he died.” The suspect said he and his brother reported the incident to a vigilante group who took them to the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) in Nanka.
