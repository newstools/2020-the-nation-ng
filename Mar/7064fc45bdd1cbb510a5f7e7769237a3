 Investors should look beyond the market situation and begin to build up their portfolios with stocks with strong fundamentals ahead of the expected recovery in the second half of the year. Analysts at Afrinvest Securities in their investment advisory report stated that while the spreading impact of Covid-19 and crude oil crash might adversely impact the performance of the stock market in the immediate period, the steep price depreciation and steady fundamentals of several stocks imply strong potential for considerable returns in the medium to long-term. According to analysts, there are opportunities in the stock market for medium to long-term investors as the market valuation, the lowest since 2015, has built up potential for capital gains and high dividend yields. “Given the effectiveness of social distancing measures to fighting the spread of Covid-19 and its wide adoption in countries most vulnerable to the virus, we could see a resumption of economic activities in second half of 2020 which would support crude oil prices and market performance. Thus, we advise a gradual entry approach, buying in tranches, into the Nigerian equities market given the uncertainties both on the global and domestic fronts,” Afrinvest Securities stated. Analysts selected a portfolio of 12 stocks which they considered as liquid stocks with high dividend yields and strong fundamentals for consideration by investors. These stocks included Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB), Zenith Bank International, Flour Mills of Nigeria, Stanbic IBTC Holdings, United Bank for Africa (UBA), MTN Communications Nigeria, Nestle Nigeria, Okomu Oil Palm, Dangote Cement, United Capital, Access Bank and Nascon Allied Industries. Analysts noted that while the domestic incidence of Covid-19 has been moderate, the domestic equities market has been reeling from a global contagion that has wiped off initial 10.7 per cent gains and caused a slump of -15.4 per cent on year-to-date basis. “This is the worst start to a year since 2016, and the reaction of investors reflects concerns about Nigeria’s vulnerability to external shocks, mainly oil,” Afrinvest Securities stated. The slowdown in global oil demand, in addition to the decision of oil producing countries to abandon output cuts, had caused a 50.2 per cent drop in oil prices to $32.9 per barrel by the weekend, the lowest in over four years. Analysts pointed out that with oil price below the budget benchmark of $57 per barrel, there is a risk of poor implementation of the 2020 budget, thus less support for growth. According to analysts, with the external reserves fallen by 6.3 per cent so far this year to $36.2 billion, and with little prospect for accretion given capital flight and low oil prices, there is a risk of currency devaluation. “In light of these risk factors, domestic and foreign investors have maintained a risk-off approach towards Nigerian equities, leading to massive sell-offs. However, this presents interesting opportunities for medium to long-term investors. With the increasing adoption of social distancing measures, which is proven to have worked in some countries, there is a higher chance that the world would defeat Covid-19 and economic activities would pick-up in second half of 2020,” Afrinvest Securities.

Stanbic IBTC Holdings recorded a net profit of N75.04 billion in 2019 as the financial holding company sustained steady growths across key performance indicators. The board of the holding company yesterday indicated that it has recommended payment of N21 billion as dividend for the 2019 business year, implying a dividend per share of N2, 33.3 per cent increase on N1.50 per share paid for the 2018 business year.
