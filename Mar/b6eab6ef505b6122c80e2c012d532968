Close sources that confirmed the development, had revealed that security had been beefed up in the area as sporadic gunshots forced residents of the twin communities to desert their homes. A source alleged that those who sustained severe injuries had been rushed to hospital in neighbouring university community of Abraka in Ethiope East local government area. â€œObinomba was supposed to be celebrating their Ukwata Festival by now but some persons from Obinomba in Umukwata Kingdom encroached into Umusume, an Obiaruku community to celebrate their festival.
