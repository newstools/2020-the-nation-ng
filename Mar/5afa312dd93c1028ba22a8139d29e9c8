 MUSHIN Local Government in Lagos State on Monday fumigated major markets, drainages and parks. Council’s Head of Environment Fatai- Omogbolahan Agbaje said the idea was to contain and control coronavirus. Agbaje noted they educated  traders on how to protect themselves, gave out sanitisers and trained them on how to identify symptoms of COVID-19 and what to do if members or those around them develop symptoms. On effects of the fumigation on human beings and why it was not done at night,  he said it would not harm humans, but was made to kill bacteria. Agbaje said they also fumigated road sides, adding that they moved from Mushin market to Olorunsogo. He said the council was being preemptive to curtail spread of the virus. The HOD said the exercise, which began yesterday, go on throughout the council.
