 Comedian and Nollywood actor, Woli Arole has said the Social Media Bill will restrict many youths and Nigerians from lending their voices to current happenings in the country. Arole was a guest on Channels TV during the week when he spoke about the effects of the ‘Social Media Use Bill’ if and when passed into law in the country. “I lend my voice amidst millions of Nigerians to protect our freedom of speech right over the Social Media Bill that is about to be passed into law.  My take on it is that the Social Media has been a tool of expression for us, so restricting us from talking about matters, limits us from passing messages through our crafts and that means you are practically taking our rights from us,” he said. The comedian is recently on a tour of different Universities across Nigeria, after which he will be paying a visit to the United Kingdom this month.
