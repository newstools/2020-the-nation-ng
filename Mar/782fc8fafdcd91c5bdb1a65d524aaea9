The Federal Government will today arraign a lawyer, Eziafa Samuel Enwedo, at a Federal High Court in Abuja on a six-count charge of conspiracy and forgery of court documents. The Nation learnt that the lawyer would be arraigned before Justice Okon Abang, who sits in Court Six of the Federal High Court, Abuja. In the charge marked: FHC/ABJ/CR/78/2020, filed on March 12 by Celestine Uroko Udo of the Legal/Prosecution Section, Force Headquarters, Abuja, Enwedo is said to have conspired with Obinna Uzoh and three others to forge documents of the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and the court’s judgment to remove Senator Ifeanyi Ubah from office as the lawmaker representing Anambra South Senatorial District. According to the charge, Uzoh, Anani Anacletus Chuka, Aroh Ifunanya and Faith Samuel, with whom Enwedo allegedly conspired to commit the offences, are at large. Enwedo and some others recently claimed to have obtained a judgment from the High Court of the Federal  Capital Territory (FCT), purporting to sack Ubah, who represents Anambra South in the Senate, for allegedly giving false information to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) about his academic qualifications. The appeal Ubah filed against the judgment, in which he alleged among others, denial of fair hearing, was heard last Thursday by the Court of Appeal in Abuja and judgment was reserved. But, in the six-count charge, Enwedo was accused of working with others (named in the charge, including Uzoh) to forge documents relating to the suit, including the judgment.
