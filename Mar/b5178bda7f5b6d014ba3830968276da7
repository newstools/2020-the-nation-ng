The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Wednesday declared coronavirus a pandemic. A pandemic is a disease that is spreading in multiple countries around the world at the same time. Some of Dangote’s firms under the parent-company, Dangote Group, suffered big losses at the market.

Allaying public fears about development in the market, the Association of Securities Dealing Houses of Nigeria (ASHON) assured investors that the market would soon bounce back. It said the fundamentals of quoted companies remained strong. ASHON chairman Chief Oyinyechukwu Ezeagu explained that the stock market remained part of the global exchanges and as such any development in the world market would impact on its operations. Ezeagu said: “The effect of the coronavirus is gradually affecting trading all over the world and whatever happens elsewhere reflects in our market. “The centre of it all is China and being a major world power both in productive and consumption capacities, any ill wind affecting China would naturally cause a big sneezing to the rest of world. “Investors should not panic. The share prices will bounce back. The companies’ fundamentals remain strong. Many investors are taking advantage of the bearish run to beef up their portfolios.” Coronavirus first hit Wuhan in China in December 2019. Over 3000 people have died of the pandemic in the country. Since then, the pandemic has spread worldwide with countries in Europe mostly affected. About 125,000 cases have been reported worldwide with 4,605 dead.
