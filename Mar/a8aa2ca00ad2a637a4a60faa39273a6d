Former Big Brother Naija housemate, Offiong Edet Anthony, aka Thin Tall Tony, is set to return on stage with the play ‘Bending and Bonding’. Thin Tall Tony returns to stage as one of the lead actors in the play as Eroz Theatre births in Ikorodu. Written by Paul Ugbedeh and directed by Babs Ademoye, the show parades array of highly talented artistes including Dede Kevin Alozie, Edna Frank Konwe and Mary Abishai Akam. ‘Bending and Bonding’ is a side-splitting play, a satire of the battles couples go through in marriage and how they try to solve them. Itoro and Dele are going through a marriage crisis. For Itoro, their grace to grass lifestyle, engineered by Dele’s reckless economic lifestyle must stop if this marriage must work. Dele is determined to put behind him, his mistakes of the past and he wants to do it by making the same mistake. Speaking with reporters, the artists shared their thoughts on the initiative Eroz Theatre and the play ‘Bending and Bonding’. Thin Tall Tony, who plays the role of Pastor, says he is excited to be part of the show. “The play, ‘Bending and Bonding’, is one of a kind. It’s very interesting and it’s a simple play that talks that we don’t have a lot of communication as families sometimes, we assume a lot, and if it is a situation where we have to come together, talk about it and clear our differences, we should be able to do that earlier. If we detect that there is a problem, communication is key. But the play is also very hilarious.”
