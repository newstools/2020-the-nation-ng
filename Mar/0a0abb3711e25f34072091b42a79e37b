Power outage and lack of clinical staff have crippled activities at the University of Uyo Teaching Hospital (UUTH) in Akwa Ibom State. Chief Medical Officer (CMD) Dr. Emem Abasi Bassey, who spoke to reporters on Monday, said the situation has hindered the expected output from the hospital. He added that shortage of clinical staff have taken a toll on few available ones, saying it was high time the concerned authorities employed more doctors and nurses. The CMD spoke when leaders of the Civil Liberties Organisation (CLO), led by the Chairman, Otuekong Isong, visited the hospital to ascertain its challenges. Bassey regretted that the hospital run on generator everyday since there are patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) who need uninterrupted power supply. ‘In the last two months, we have not had power supply for up to 20 hours cumulatively,’ he lamented. He said: “The greatest challenge we have in this hospital is power. We run 24 hours on diesel, over two years we were not connected with PHEDC, even when we eventually did two months ago, we’ve never had up to 20 hours’ of power cumulatively. “Due to constant running of our generators, wear and tear had set in as our 1000KVA generator that powered the entire hospital has broken down, and we need about N10-12million to fix the crankshaft, which is the engine. “What we actually need now is dedicated power line, the PHEDC had asked us to pay about N85 million to have it, because it will require a substation, but we don’t have such money. We have written to the government, Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) and others for assistance. If we have power, there will be 50 per cent improvement in our services. “We have people on life support, and anytime power goes off, the person is gone, that is why we cannot allow light to go off in that unit, even for a second…”
