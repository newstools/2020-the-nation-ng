Chief Judge Justice Kazeem Alogba said from Monday, the public will be restricted from gaining entry into courtrooms. Only litigants with urgent matters or applications will be allowed entry from Monday. Alogba gave the directive on Friday in a statement titled: Entry into court premises guidelines’, signed by his Chief Registrar, Mrs D.T Olatokun. The directive is part of measures to curb the spread of Coronavirus (COVID19) and “safeguard the health of court personnel and users.” It reads: “Members of the general public will not be allowed entry into the court premises, save those who have come to file urgent matters/applications. “In all cases, only parties whose cases are to be heard, their witness and counsel will be allowed into the courtroom at any sitting time, subject to a maximum of twenty persons altogether. “In the courtroom, persons shall keep a distance of at least one metre to each other, as recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO).” The CJ also directed that in criminal matters only remand/bail applications and overnight cases will be heard. As for civil matters “only ex-parte and urgent applications and adoption of written addresses will be entertained. Judgments and rulings will also be read.”
