The Chairman, Agbado Oke-Odo Local Council Development Area (LCDA), Dr. Augustine Arogundade, says the council has begun to disburse N1million monthly for the empowerment of the people at the grassroots. He told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday that each beneficiary was receiving N100,000 monthly. “The LCDA has increased the budgetary allocation of the Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation department to sustain the empowerment it is giving to the needy every month. ”We now give N1million to 10 people every month at the rate of N100,000 each for empowerment and skill acquisition. “The beneficiaries are selected from the seven wards in the LCDA by the ward chairmen and councillors in the communities within the wards,’’ Arogundade said. He said the majority of the beneficiaries used the money to establish small scale businesses and to acquire skills. The LCDA boss said that many people who received the N100, 000 grant from the council knew the businesses they could set up to enhance their daily living. According to him, the LCDA allows the people close to the grassroots to select the needy to enable the grant reach those who need it. ”We do it in such a way that the beneficiaries are mainly those who are in need of the capital, at least to empower them and sustain their daily incomes and expenses,’’ he added. Arogundade said that the council was ready to give more dividends of democracy to the people at the grassroots.
