The youthful and bubbling governor of Oyo State, Mr. Seyi Makinde, has a new name: GSM, meaning Governor Seyi Makinde. Prior to his election, he took much pleasure in his professional appellation as an engineer to add pep to his campaign. He was so much obsessed with the Engineer title. His sudden change to GSM means he adopts as his name the acronym for ‘global system of mobile communication’. The only difference, however, is that his own GSM has no mobile network. Time will tell on the full import of this change of name. What is certain for now is that he is not alone, considering that one of his colleagues in the North has ATM as his acronym. It is different strokes for different folks.
