 THE police in Lagos have arrested three men for allegedly vandalising a public cemetery and removing a human skull. The suspects Dauda Tijani, 42, Olawale Shodolamu, 70, and Seun Falana, 37 were arrested separately by police operatives attached to Area E Command. It was gathered that Falana, an attendant at Trinity Cemetery Ajegunle, allegedly removed human skulls from graves and sold to herbalists for N10,000. Police said the three men were picked up after operatives on March 1 intercepted Tijani around Alakija with a black polythene bag containing a skull. “He confessed that he was sent by one herbalist, Olawale Shodolamu, 70, to collect the skull from a cemetery attendant. “The herbalist was arrested and he claimed that he bought the human skull from one Seun Falana, 37, a worker at Trinity Cemetery Ajegunle at  N10,000. “The herbalist said he usually ground the human skull with other substances to prepare herbs and charms for his customers.“ The suspects will soon be charged to court,” spokesman Bala Elkana yesterday said.
