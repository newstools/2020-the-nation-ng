 SAMUEL Kalu and Josh Maja have both been placed on partial unemployment by French Ligue 1 side Bordeaux on account of the Coronavirus Pandemic. This means by law that Bordeaux can only pay the players 70% of what is due them until the Pandemic is sorted and the club are back in action. Ligue 1 has been suspended due to the Coronavirus outbreak. The players will not train together until further notice due to the public health challenge confronting the world. Olympique Marseille and Lyon are among the other Ligue 1 clubs who have placed their players on partial unemployment. Meanwhile, the president of Saint-Etienne’s supervisory board, Bernard Caiazzo, has said that many professional clubs in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 will declare bankruptcy within six months if the coronavirus pandemic continues to halt football in the country. Speaking with France Bleu Saint-Etienne Loire, Caiazzo said he fears for the future of his club and those in similar financial situations, with no date in sight for football to resume. “I am very, very, very worried for all the clubs,” he said. “Without state aid, within six months, half of professional clubs will have to file for bankruptcy. The five major leagues have already lost 4 billion euros and the French league between 500m euros and 600m euros.” Fierce rivals Lyon were one of the first big French clubs to adopt the policy of partial unemployment, which sees the state fund a large proportion of the playing staff’s salaries, with many since doing the same.
