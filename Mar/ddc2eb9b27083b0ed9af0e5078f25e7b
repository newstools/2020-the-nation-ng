The momentum of activities at the Nigerian stock market nearly halved to its lowest in recent period after authorities shut trading floors across the country as precautions against the spreading Coronavirus pandemic. All indicators of activities at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) closed weekend with turnover volume, value and number of deals at their lowest in recent period. The NSE had on Wednesday March 25 shut down its trading floors across the country under a 30-day COVID-19 emergency response programme. Turnover at the Exchange closed weekend at 1.45 billion shares worth N14.92 billion in 21,828 deals for the week, representing 48.2 per cent decline in turnover volume, 54.8 per cent drop in value and 31.2 per cent decrease in number of deals. The NSE had recorded total turnover of 2.80 billion shares valued at N32.56 billion in 31,715 deals penultimate week. Last week’s turnover was the lowest in the past six weeks as Nigeria’s confirmed Covid-19 cases continued to rise and authorities scrambled to impose stricter containment measures. These include closure of non-essential drug and food markets, social joints and all gatherings more than 25 persons. Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), Oscar Onyema, said the closure of the iconic Lagos trading floor and other mini floors across the country was in response to significant growth in new cases of Covid-19 infection. He explained that during the 30-day remote working plan, the Exchange will operate fully on remote trading basis while NSE staff will be available through all its digital platforms to provide support. Trading pattern at the stock market also showed a flight to safety with investors holding on to Nigeria’s largest banks, widely considered as some of the most liquid and safest assets to hold at all times. The trio of Zenith Bank Plc, Nigeria’s second largest financial institution; Guaranty Trust Bank Plc, Nigeria’s largest financial institution and FBN Holdings Plc, Nigeria’s oldest bank, were the most active stocks. The three most active stocks accounted for 713.80 million shares worth N8.61 billion in 8,608 deals, representing 49.18 per cent and 57.71 per cent of the total equity turnover volume and value respectively. With this, the financial services sector also dominated the sectoral breakdown of activities with a turnover of 1.22 billion shares valued at N10.59 billion in 14,944 deals; representing 84.32 per cent and 70.99 per cent of the total equity turnover volume and value respectively. The conglomerates sector followed with 50.261 million shares worth N61.457 million in 442 deals. The third place was the Consumer Goods industry, with a turnover of 47.276 million shares worth N2.509 billion in 2,225 deals. Share prices continued to fall as investors remained risk-averse in spite of significant undervaluation and attractiveness of most quoted stocks. Benchmark price indices showed average decline of 1.52 per cent last week, equivalent to net loss of N175 billion. This worsened the negative average year-to-date return to -18.55 per cent. This implies that, on the average, every investor has lost at least 18.55 per cent of his portfolio so far this year. Aggregate market value of all quoted equities at the NSE dropped to N11.393 trillion at the weekend compared with N11.568 trillion recorded as the opening value for the week. The All Share Index (ASI)- the value-based index that tracks all share prices at the NSE, declined from its week’s opening index of 22,198.43 points to close weekend at 21,861.78 points. Onyema said all physical meetings within and outside NSE’s office premises have been suspended until further notice while the Exchange has instructed its employees to leverage technological tools to conduct meetings virtually. ”Dealing members are, therefore, encouraged to continue to trade remotely via our electronic platforms such as FIX protocol and XNET, and reach out to their compliance officer if any support is required. Please note that we will provide manual support to members without remote access during this period. Issuers who have any business to conduct with the Exchange can reach out to their relationship manager for guidance. You should continue to submit all regulatory filings via Issuers’ Portal (X-Issuer), “ Onyema said.
