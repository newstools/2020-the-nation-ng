The First Lady, Aisha Buhari on Monday called for a total lockdown over the outbreak of coronavirus in the country. She commended the state governors for closing down schools but stated that it could be counterproductive if children stay and home and parents go to work. In a tweet via her official page, she said ” It is commendable that state governors have closed down schools; however, this could be counterproductive if parents are still going to work. We should not isolate students and expose their parents. “Let us remember that they will meet at home. #TotalLockDown #StayAtHome”
