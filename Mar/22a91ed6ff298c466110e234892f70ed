Nigeria-born, Nigeria-breed but South Africa-based Disc Jockey, DJ Bamzyriches has opened up on why he relocated to South Africa to pursue his dream of becoming a DJ when it appeared nothing was really working in his favour in Nigeria. Bamzyriches made the revelation, in a recent interview, adding that South Africa offers better opportunities for anyone seeking livelihood in entertainment than Nigeria. He said,“While in Nigeria it was very difficult for me to chase my dream of becoming a DJ or a singer. To blow in the Nigerian music scene is very difficult. As an upcoming artiste, everyone look down on you and make no move to help but here in South Africa it’s a different ball gall. They give you opportunities here. Since I moved here four years ago things have really changed. I have had many opportunities, including travelling to many countries of the world.” Speaking further, he gave the true picture of universality of Nigerian Afrobeats in South Africa, saying the genre is not of national consequence. “Afrobeat is popular here in South Africa, no questions asked but not at the national scale. Most South Africans still prefer their native music and dancehall to any kind of music. You should also know that Nigerians also get most of their beats from South African music. South Africans love dancehall,” he said. Bamzyriches, born Olaiya Olatunde Abdul-lateef relocated to South Africa in 2016 but started life as a professional Disc Jockey in 2018. He was born April 9, 1995 in Lagos State. He hails from Akure South local government area of Ondo State. He grew up Sango Otta, Ogun State and attended Iganmode Grammar School, Sango Otta, Ogun State. He studied Accounting at Ekiti State University. Bamzyriches has worked with notable Disc Jockeys in South Africa like DJ Mophorisa, DJ Tira and many others. His quest to be a DJ began when he was just 15 years of age.
