 NIGERIAN equities showed strong underlying rally on Tuesday but losses suffered by large-cap stocks depressed the market situation. With 27 advancers to 12 decliners, benchmark indices at the Nigerian stock market indicated average decline of 0.71 per cent, equivalent to net capital depreciation of N84 billion. Average year-to-date return worsened to -16.0 per cent. The negative market situation was driven largely by losses suffered by large-cap stocks, especially Dangote Cement, Nigeria’s most capitalised stock.
