 A visibly angry Delta Governor Senator Ifeanyi Okowa on Thursday rebuked some commissioners for staying away from a scheduled quarterly press conference, threatening sanctions against them. He directed the Secretary to the State Government, Mr Chiedu Ebie to compile a list of those absent  and send same to his office immediately. Okowa rebuked the absentee commissioners during the interactive session at the quarterly press briefing in Asaba- the State Capital shortly after his remarks. The governor said it was unfair for them to stay away from the press briefing especially when some of the clarifications to questions by reporters involved their ministries. He queried the SSG on the reason for the high rate of absenteeism but the scribe assured him that everyone was notified of the conference. His words: “Why are some many commissioners absent? It is not fair. Henceforth every commissioner must make it a duty to attend events of this magnitude. SSG compile a list of those absent at today’s briefing.” Some commissioners who  the Governor sought clarifications from but were unavailable include Delta Higher Education Commissioner, Prof Patrick Muoboghare; Health Commissioner, Dr Mozia Mordi and  Head of Service, Reginald Bayoko, among others.
