 NIGERIA’s leading innovative and customer-friendly telco, 9mobile, over the weekend expanded its 4G-LTE service to the commercial city of Kano. Ado Bayero Mall on Zoo Road, Kano was a beehive as the telco berthed the 9mobile funfair train in the historic city, thereby affording customers and fun seekers a weekend of free fun which accompanied the awareness campaign of the telco’s 4G-LTE aimed at bringing superior quality service closer to the people. Commenting on the 4G-LTE deployment, Director, Network Operations, 9mobile, Abdulmutallib Muhammed, said it demonstrated the telco’s commitment to continue offering superior quality services to its customers. “We are leaders in the data space with our low latency rate for high-speed connectivity and planned redundancy to minimise downtime impact. Now, with the 9mobile 4G LTE, millions of our customers will be able to make clear and crisp calls as well as have access to faster internet for browsing and online experience at all times. It’s bye to buffering. Our data is one of the most affordable and best in terms of speed because quality service is our number one objective. We are enabling our customers to do more and get more,” he said. Muhammed further highlighted the uniqueness of 9mobile’s 4G LTE, noting that it was born 4G-LTE ready and that customers don’t need a subscriber identity module (SIM) swap to enjoy it.
