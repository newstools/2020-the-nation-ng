 Saturday, March 14, was a night of glamour and beauty as African actresses and other celebrities from difference spheres of life gathered for the Africa Magic Viewers’ Choice Awards AMVCA 2020. It turned out to be a very fulfilling night for many of our celebrities as many won different awards, while other only came to slay and display their lovely outfits. Some of the celebrities appeared fantastically elegant, while other appeared nonchalant and shabby with their dressing. The appearance of those who looked super beautiful in the event, proves that there have been massive improvement in the fashion industry, which implies that great fashion designers have emerged in the industry, while those designers that have been there before now have greatly improve.
