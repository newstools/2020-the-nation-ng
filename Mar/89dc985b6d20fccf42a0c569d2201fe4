 WIKKI Tourists handler, Usman Abd’Allah has revealed that his wards defeat of Kano Pillars is to send a warning to other clubs in the topflight that they won’t have it easy against them. Mohammed Guda’s second half penalty kick was enough to hand the Savannah Elephants the maximum points in the NPFL Matchday 25 tie played at the Tafawa Balewa Stadium, Bauchi on Wednesday. Abd’Allah in his assessment of the game hinted that Wikki could have thrashed Pillars effortlessly had the players converted the chances they had and he thumbed up the performance of his players who bossed the game. “Kano Pillars were not able to withstand us at all. We dominated them and could have been ahead by 3-0 in the first half and it was the same in the second half until we got the penalty kick,” Abd’Allah said. “If my boys can play the same way they did against Kano Pillars in our remaining games, we will finish in a more respectable position on the league table. We have gone round some centres and only a few clubs can beat us in ideal setting.” Abd’Allah also said that players and officials of the team have been given a week break to enable them stay with their families.
