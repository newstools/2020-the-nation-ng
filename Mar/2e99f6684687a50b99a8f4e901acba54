Legendary boxing trainer Ronnie Shields believes that Efe Ajagba can be a better boxer if he punches faster and harder early in his fights. Ajagba faced perhaps his toughest and most experienced opponent in former world title challenger Razvan Cojanu, knocking him down twice en route to the ninth round victory at the Barclays Center in New York on Saturday. The 25 year-old 2016 Nigerian Olympian fighting out of Houston, where he is trained by Shields, took his time and broke down Cojanu, whose face was badly battered by the end of the fight. Anthony Joshua celebrated the popular Nigerian delicacy pounded yam with egusi  as the  heavyweight world champion met the Queen of England for the first time on Commonwealth Day. “It was a good win, but I wanted Efe to do better,” Ronnie Shields, who has coached the likes of Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield, said after the fight. Efe punches faster and harder than what he showed. He was looking for one shot. “As soon as he started hitting Cojanu with multiple shots, that’s when the fight was over. “He should have done it earlier, so it didn’t have to go nine rounds.”
