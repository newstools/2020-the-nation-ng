STARTIMES Nigeria has introduced an inspiring football guess game:  Stellar ‘Win Online’, through its Facebook and mobile app, StarTimes ON. Stellar ‘Win Online’ is an online guess game for subscribers to watch and participate in football matches broadcast by StarTimes, and win incentives and awards. Unlike other games, Stellar Online gives participants the chance to become winners and showcase their knowledge. The new offerings revolve around sporting activities as athletics and tournaments. While the presentation differs, the process of answering the questions has been simplified,  enabling users give direct answers to questions. Winners will be picked randomly and rewarded while active and participants will be compensated. The name Stellar was got from a Lion that has consistently represented the brand image and will host the Steller movement once the game begins. Subscribers are to keep themselves updated with posts on StarTimes Facebook platforms for active participation.
