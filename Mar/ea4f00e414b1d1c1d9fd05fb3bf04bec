 Veteran musicians, Jimi Solanke, Yinka Alakija, Jesse King have been announced as some of the African artists billed to perform at the second edition of Popo Aguda Easter Musical Extravaganza. The festival is slated for April 12 at the Campos Mini Stadium, Lagos Island. The festival’s second edition has been tagged: ‘Strengthening Our Roots’ and is put together by the Brazilian Descendants  and the Consulate General of Brazil, Lagos. According to the convener, Bolaji Charles Mendes, the free event is desired to give back joy, relaxation, and comradeship to the historical community of Brazilian Quarters (Popo Aguda) on Lagos Island. “We are equally presenting our Lagos and Brazilian cultures by bringing the Lagos State University (LASU) drama group, Eko Samba group and the exclusive Popo Aguda Meboi group (The Bull, the Ostrich, the Horse) to do justice to the drama presentations and cultural aspect of Lagos State and our Popo Aguda community,” Mendes said. Mendes further hinted that the music-drama concert will also be featuring great musicians who are related to the Brazilian origin. “A band representation from Brazil, Mr. Juri Passos, a Brazilian drummer, Alagbe rooted in traditional Yoruba music from Salvado, Bahia is also an instructor having trained many people in learning how to beat the drum,” he said. On his part, the Secretary Consul General of the Brazilian Embassy in Lagos, Samuel Heldges Bamdeira said the Embassy was excited that the Brazilian descendants could wake up to trace their roots.
