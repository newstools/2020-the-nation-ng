Nigerians took to the social media, especially twitter, on Monday to condemn the dethronement of Muhammad Sanusi 11 as Emir of Kano. They berated Governor, Umar Ganduje, who they accused was behind Sanusi’s removal. Sanusi was dethroned for alleged disrespect to lawful instructions from the government. Some of the reactions were; @Yusufdano “Same Ganduje that was caught on camera taking bribe is the same one dethroning an honest and educated King. Nigeria is the ghetto.” @MsLami “It’s cute how Ganduje is flexing his muscles now, immunity will soon expire and he will suffer. That’s for sure @Chydee “The same Ganduje whose Dollars-in-Agbada bribe videos went viral really championed the removal of Emir Sanusi for “corruption”. Comedy Republic of Nigeria.” @Ayemojubar “If not for the pitiful system of government we have, how would Ganduje be a governor in a state where someone like Emir Sanusi of CBN exists?Princes on foot, slaves on horses. Who is Ganduje without political power? Dr. Dípò Awójídé (@OgbeniDipo) said “Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II, one of the few Northerners who speak up against child marriage, poverty, out of school children & drug addiction has been removed. After they tried to suppress his voice for many months. You wonder what manner of politics this is & to what end.” Similarly, a former lawmaker representing Kaduna Central Senatorial District in the National Assembly, Senator Shehu Sani, said those behind the dethronement of the Emir of Kano, Muhammad Sanusi II, displayed “the intolerance and toxicity of the liquor of power” Dele Momodu also wrote: “I hope now that GOVERNOR GANDUJE and his co-conspirators have taken their pound of flesh by dethroning the Emir of Kano, their eyes will clear and see later that their own power too is transient!
