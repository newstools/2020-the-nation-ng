Ondo State Police Command has confirmed the arrest of a member of the Road Transport Employers Association (RTEAN) Mr. Shuaib Kalejaye who used cutlass to inflict injuries on his wife, Olabisi and ran away. Kalejaye was said to have carried out the action at Ayeka community in Okitipupa, Ondo State because his wife said she wanted to leave the marriage.

ASP Ikoro said the suspect has been transferred to the police headquarters. Ikoro said his arrest showed the Nigeria Police is capable of catching any suspect. Elder brother of Olabisi, Mr. Olatunde Adeola, urged the police to ensure justice is served on the matter.
