The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Thursday arraigned a worker of Pension Transitional Arrangement Directorate (PTAD), Mr Charles Abonyi, at a Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court, Wuse Zone 2, for allegedly receiving N30,000 gratification. Abonyi, an auditor with PTAD, of no fixed address, is facing a one-count charge. Prosecution counsel, Mr Sunday Robert, told the court that sometime in 2016, the defendant allegedly received N30,000 from Dennis Chukwudi as a reward for paying his fathers’ pension. He said such gratification was against the ethics of the job. Robert said the offence contravened Section 8 of the Independent and Other Fraud Related Offences Act 2006 and punishable under the same Act. The defendant pleaded not guilty to the charge. The defendant’s lawyer S. A. Ajayi said he served the prosecutor an application for bail on March 4. He prayed the court to allow his client to continue with the administrative bail pending when the bail application would be ready for hearing. The judge, Justice Ajoke Adepoju, asked the prosecutor if the defendant had defaulted since he was given the administrative bail and he said no. The judge said he should continue with the EFCC’s administrative bail, pending when the bail application would be ready. He adjourned the matter till April 2 for hearing and ruling on the bail application.
