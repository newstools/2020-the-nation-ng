The National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) has suspended its enrollment across the country to prevent spread of COVID-19. NIMC Head of Corporate Communication, Mr Kayode Adegoke, said this on Tuesday in a statement in Abuja. Adegoke said the suspension became necessary to promote physical distancing and prevent the spread of coronavirus among the people. ” This is in line with the recent directive by the Federal Government that all officers on Grade Level 12 and below should stay at home. ”NIMC wishes to inform the general public that enrollment and other ancillary services across the federation are hereby suspended effective Tuesday, March 24, 2020 till further notice. “This decision was reached following rising cases of infected persons in the country as stated by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control. ” The decision was also informed by NIMC’s desire to ensure safety of all Nigerians coming for enrollment as well as that of its staff,” he said. Adegoke said the decision was aimed at curtailing the rampaging coronavirus by encouraging strict adherence to social distancing and observance of necessary precaution. ” NIMC, like all well-meaning agencies of federal government, considers the health of Nigerians to be of paramount concern. ” It is therefore, our hope that together, we would tackle the COVID-19 pandemic so that life can return to normalcy, and we can resume enrollment, ” he said.
