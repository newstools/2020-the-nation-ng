Cristiano Ronaldo might be locked down in Madeira but he is clearly not letting himself go amid the Coronavirus crisis. The Juventus forward retreated to his native island towards the start of the month after his mother suffered a stroke and he has decided to stay there as COVID19 spread across the world. While the Serie A season has been suspended, Ronaldo has been staying at a luxury villa that overlooks the Atlantic Ocean. And the 35-year-old has kept up his famously stringent workout regime, posing in a photo that his sister Katia uploaded to her Instagram. The Portuguese forward showed off his six-pack and incredible dorsal muscles, and pulled up his shorts in trademark style as he stood with members of his family, including his niece Alicia and other sister Elma. Ronaldo was in top form during the season before Serie A was suspended, and had hit a staggering 13 goals in his last 11 matches in all competition. He has also been clear to his followers that they must follow the government advice and stay at home: “If you ever dreamed of playing for millions around the world, now is your chance. Play inside, play for the world.” It was revealed over the weekend that Ronaldo will join forces with his agent Jorge Mendes to help fund the fight against coronavirus in Portugal. AS report that Mendes has spent a significant amount of money buying 200,000 gowns and three ventilators for the hospital in Porto, where a National Institute of Medical Emergency (INEM) field tent has been set up to facilitate with operations due to a flood of coronavirus patients.
