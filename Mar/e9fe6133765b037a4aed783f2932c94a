A firm, CRC Credit Bureau at the weekend in Lagos, launched a mobile application. The application, called CRC App, was  launched at the company’s 10th anniversary celebrations. Its Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Tunde Popoola, said it is the first of its kind in the credit bureau industry. He said: “With CRC Mobile, individuals now have access to their credit information and credit scores through their mobile phone. The launch of the  app was part of the innovations that the company has created to enable consumers in Nigeria and diaspora access to information that empowers them to take control of their financial reputation and be better informed. “Before taking a loan, they can also monitor their exposures for accurate reporting and the reduction of identity fraud.” Popoola added that  the firm’s 13 products and services are all available on the mobile app. After download, users of the mobile app are required to register, to be able to access any of the products and services on the application. “They must also use the same details used to register for their Bank Verification Numbers (BVN),” he explained.
