 A Federal High Court in Lagos has sentenced a gateman, James Paul Tuksa, to 20 years imprisonment for terrorism, threat to life and fraud. Justice Ayokunle Faji sentenced Tuksa on three counts of the charge: 10 years for terrorism, five years for threat to life and another five years for fraud. The sentences will run concurrently, the judge said, meaning Tuksa will spend only a maximum of 10 years in jail. The sentence takes effect from October 10, 2016, when the defendant was arraigned. The judge convicted the defendant on March 13, 2020 but adjourned till Friday for sentence. Tuksa was found guilty of obtaining N5million ransom from a complainant after threatening to kill him and his family. The Office of Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) arraigned Tuksa on May 25, 2017, on a two-count charge. He pleaded not guilty. During trial, the government amended the charge to three counts and Tuksa repeated his plea. The AGF’s counsel Mr O.C. Anigbogu said Tuksa committed the offence while he was a gateman at 4a, Ibironke Crescent, Parkview Estate, Ikoyi. The court heard that Tuksa, sometime in October 2016, phoned one Victor Omotayo Awosika, of 2, Ibironke Crescent, Parkview Estate, Ikoyi, and threatened to exterminate him and his family, unless he was paid N5 million. Awosika paid up. Anigbogu said the offences contravened Sections 24 (2) (a) and (2) (1) of the Cybercrimes (Prohibition, Prevention, etc.) Act, 2015 and Section 390(9) of Criminal Code, 2004. During his trial, the prosecutor called two witnesses and tendered four exhibits including the defendant’s statement. Tuksa’s extra-judicial statement and a closed circuit television (CCTV) footage were also. Tuksa testified in his defence.
