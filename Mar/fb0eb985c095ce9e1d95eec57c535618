Two suspects arrested for allegedly dealing unlawfully in adulterated diesel have said that they bought five drums of the product from a community in Bayesla State for N20,000  hoping to sell for N30,000 per drum. Echeta Chukwuemeka, 35,  from Mmahu in Ohaji Egbema Local Government Area of the state, and Asonye Chimezie, 33,  from Okwua Onelga council of Rivers State told newsmen that they sold the fake products to enhance their lifestyle. “We were involved in the business because we wanted to use the money to help change our lifestyle. “Frankly, we were newly introduced to the business and this was our first time of doing it. Therefore, we plead with senior officers of the corps to tamper justice with mercy by releasing us”. Parading the suspects on Thursday, Imo State command of Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps Owerri Raji Ibrahim said that Echeta Chukwuemeka  and Asonye Chimezie were arrested for dealing in adulterated petroleum product popularly known as AGO. Ibrahim said they were arrested on Wednesday across River Oguta following continuous monitoring by the intelligence operatives of the corps within the area. He said that 1,250 litres of the fake AGO and the brown coloured Toyota Sienna bus with registration number ETU 254 XA (IMO) were recovered from the suspects. The Commandant said that those illegally involved in petroleum products were thwarting the economy of the country and warned that the NSCDC would ensure that they will face the full wrath of the law.
