 The Pension Transitional Arrangement Directorate (PTAD) will henceforth relate with pensioners via email or telephone. In a statement, the Directorate said the decision was taken because of the coronavirus pandemic. Only when necessary would a pensioner be invited to attend verification, it said. The statement read: “PTAD wishes to inform the public that in view of the current world health challenges occasioned by the Corona Virus Pandemic, we have made temporary changes to our verification and complaints resolution. “The procedure would be that pensioners wishing to be verified should submit their documents by email to verification@ptad.gov.nq or by regular mail to Director, Pensioner Support Services Department Pension Transitional Arrangement Directorate.  Pensioners will subsequently be invited on a given date to attend verification following review of their documentation.’’ It continued: “Pensioners having complaints should submit their complaints by email to complaints@ptad.gov.nq or can upload their complaints using the complaint link on our website www.otad.ciov.no. Pensioners with enquiries can also send these by email. PTAD will ensure respond to the needs of our pensioners in a timely manner and provide feedback promptly. “The Directorate’s greatest concern remains the continued wellbeing of our senior citizens and our staff. These temporary measures are therefore only intended to ensure their safety and comfort.
