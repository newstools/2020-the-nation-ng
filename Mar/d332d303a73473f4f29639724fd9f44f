 GOSPEL singer, Sinach is set to celebrate 30 years of active participation in music with Sinach Live in Concert (SLIC 2020). The event is set to hold on March 22 at the Convention Center, Eko Hotel & Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos. According to organisers, this year’s event is a celebration of Sinach’s 30 years of music ministry. The event date which coincides with the celebration of ‘Mother’s Day,’ according to the organisers, was chosen to celebrate the positive impact of women and mothers around the world.  Sinach will be performing live with other renowned gospel artists from both within the country and beyond. On 7 March 2019, Sinach became the first Gospel singer from Nigeria to obtain over 100 million views on ‘Way Maker,’a single video on YouTube, and the third Nigerian to achieve the feat after Davido and Yemi Alade.
