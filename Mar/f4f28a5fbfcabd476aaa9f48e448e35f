Ayo Animashaun means different things to different people. But to some musicians, he is seen as a god who has given platforms – HIPTV and The Headies – for them to ride and shine on. To mark his 50th birthday celebration, he hired Sky Lounge Restaurant, Eko Hotel, and invited top personalities to wine and dine with him. He also used the occasion to unveil the Ayo Animashaun Foundation. At the gig, close associates also witnessed the special bond shared with his daughters. He performed a special dance routine with his lovely daughters to delight of everyone in attendance. Chairman, Heirs Holdings, Tony Elumelu; Chairman, Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Amaju Melvin-Pinnick; Sir Shina Peters, Toke Makinwa; Queen Salawa Abeni; Steve Ayorinde and Dele Momodu honoured him.
