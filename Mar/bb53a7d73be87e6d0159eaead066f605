EKITI State Police Command has said it will enforce government’s order banning public gatherings exceeding 20 people over the deadly Coronavirus. A statement in Ado-Ekiti on Sunday by the spokesman, Sunday Abutu, noted that the Police Commissioner, Asuquo Amba, said it was part of measures to help government fight the disease. The command frowned ‘at the flagrant violation of orders by Governor Kayode Fayemi’, warning residents to abide by the directives or get arrested and prosecuted for sabotage.  It reads: “Henceforth, all public gatherings, be it political, social or religious, night clubs and bar, that exceed 20 people, are prohibited. Any group of persons who violate the order shall be arrested and prosecuted. “The commissioner of police advises everyone to be law abiding for the benefit of all and our society, as the command will always prioritise the safety of life and property.”
