 Foremost  female ping ponger  Olufunke Oshonaike has described the postponement of Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games due to the Covid-19 Virus pandemic  as a setback  to retire from the sport  at the end of the quadrennial event. Oshonaike who  will be making history as the first African female athlete to be attend seven Olympic Games in Tokyo , said she was not surprised with the decision of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to postpone the games to 2021, adding that safety of athletes must take precedent over competition. “I am not surprised that the games has been postponed because I was actually expecting it,” She explained  in an interview  with NationSport.“ What I did not like initially was  people pressurizing the  IOC to make the decision earlier but it is a good development for athletes and officials now that the Olympics have been postponed. “Personally, it is a setback to my retirement because I was planning to quit this year after the Tokyo Olympic Games ;now  my retirement has now been postponed till 2021. “Generally, the postponement will surely give athletes the chance to prepare very well for the games and it will also help me as well. I am indeed looking forward to my last Olympic Games having started the sojourn at Atlanta 1996 in United States,” she added. For the duo of Offiong Edem and Olajide Omotayo, the decision to shift the games was a welcome development as the COVID-19 is a threat to the world. Edem who picked one of the four slots in the women’s event of the African Olympic Qualifiers last month in Tunis told NationSport from her base in Madrid, Spain that shifting the games would surely help the athletes to have ample time to prepare for the games, but she however lamented the lockdown that had kept her indoor in the last three weeks. Unlike Edem, Omotayo who has stranded in Italy in the last three weeks, the postponement would surely give him more time to shape up for his maiden outing at the games.
