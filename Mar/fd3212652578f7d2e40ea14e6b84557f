 ANTHONY JOSHUA believes Tyson Fury’s battle with depression and mental health issues has improved him as a fighter. Joshua’s British rival had previously been on a journey of anguish and despair before beating the undefeated Deontay Wilder in their Las Vegas rematch in February. And Joshua believes Fury’s 30 months away from the ring between November 2015 and June 2018 has made the Gypsy King an even better boxer. Joshua, speaking on Lucozade Sport’s Running The Show podcast, said of Fury’s recent win over Wilder: ‘Fury is very talented. Wilder is very talented. They went in there and gave their best and one man came out on top. ‘Maybe Wilder thought it was going to be an easier fight because Fury had a long lay-off and had his own issues outside of the ring and stuff like that. ‘They were both physically conditioned for the fight but sometimes when you have been at rock bottom where Fury was the only way is up. ‘You can’t actually go any lower than that so he picked himself up and only he knew how high he took his heights. You can only let yourself get to rock bottom again. ‘I think he was at his highest height that night so it paid off for him. Mentally he was at the best place possible and he just pulled off a great performance against a dangerous puncher.’ Fury defeated Wilder at the MGM Grand after the American’s coach Mark Breland threw in the towel during the seventh round. Wilder was battered and bruised but wanted to carry on in order to go out on his ‘shield and sword’. The outspoken Bronze Bomber has activated a clause which will see him go up against Fury for a third time in the summer. Wilder and Fury are set to go head-to-head in Las Vegas on July 18. Joshua will be desperate to fight either of his two main heavyweight adversaries but he must first take on Kubrat Pulev in their June bout at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.
