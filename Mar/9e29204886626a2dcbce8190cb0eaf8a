 Nigerian striker Victor Osimhen has been among the top French Ligue 1 best five finishers following his goal scoring form with OSC Lille in the on-going campaign. The 21-year-old has scored an impressive 13 goals on the last count in the Ligue1 to be so ranked behind the likes of PSG duo of  Kylian  Mbappe and Neymar in a data polled together by whoscored.com. French striker Mbappe is ranked in first position partly for his 18-goal haul and five assists and he is the only player in the top five that has not been cautioned this season. Mbappe is closely followed by two of his compatriots Wissam Ben Yedder and Moussa Dembele who came second and third respectively with 18 and 16 goals listed against their names. Former Barcelona striker Neymar is in fourth position for his 13-goal tally. The Brazilian has five assists ahead of Osimhen’s two assists. Osimhen who idolised former African Footballer of the Year Didier Drogba hinted recently about his rich vein of form in the French Ligue 1, adding he was having the best time of career at Lille. “I’m happy and I’m playing regularly for Lille,” the Super Eagles forward told Nation Sport. “I’m really proud because Lille has helped in showcasing my talent to the world and I feel at home here.” In a related development, Manchester United will reportedly rekindle their interest in Lyon striker Dembele at the end of the season with a £60m bid, claims The Sun. Dembele was heavily linked with a move to the Premier League last month but Lyon refused to do business with Chelsea. United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wanted  to sign a new striker at the end of the season after missing out on Erling Haaland to Borussia Dortmund last month, but ended up getting ex-Watford man Odion Ighalo on loan for the remainder of the season but intend to make a major addition in the summer.
