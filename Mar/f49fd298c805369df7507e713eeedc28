 THERE was tension in Kasuwar Barchi Market, Kaduna on Sunday as the state government issued a three-day notice to the traders to vacate their shops. Kasuwar Barchi is a famous market in the North due to its large concentration on secondhand foreign textile materials. The market, according to its union leaders, has over 15,000 traders, including those who own shops and others who do business on its premises. The three-day notice signed by the Director-General of the Kaduna State Urban Planning and Development Authority (KASUPDA), Ismail Umar-Dikko was pasted on the doors of the shops on Saturday morning. Reason for the quit notice, the government said, is to allow for upgrade of the market. The notice read: “In view of the Urban Renewal Projects by the Kaduna State Government (Upgrading of Kusuwar Barci market) you are hereby given three days from the date of receipt of this notice to remove all vour valuables and vacate the site. “Failure to comply with this directive will leave the Authority with no option but to demolish/remove your stall at your expense in accordance to Section 60 of the Kaduna State Urban and Regional Planning Law of 2018.” When our correspondent visited the market Sunday afternoon, traders were seen moving the wares, equipment and furniture, among others, out of the market.
