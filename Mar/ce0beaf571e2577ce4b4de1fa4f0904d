Four suspected vandals attempting to smuggle Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), popularly called petrol, to Benin Republic have been arrested by officials of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC). The suspects, Akpoundje Sunday, 32,  Soke Enoch, 25, Alber Kouwonou, 25, and Marsiel Evessehuo, 24, were apprehended at Idale High Sea at the weekend by operatives of the corps in Badagry. It was gathered that 130 jerricans of 25 litres each were filled with petrol, and two engine boats were recovered from the suspects. According to NSCDC Commandant Fasiu Adeyinka, the suspects were arrested by the marine unit of the anti-vandalism squad in Badagry in the early hours of Thursday while they attempted to ship the products to Cotonou in Benin Republic. Adeyinka said the operatives in another operation intercepted three wooden boats on the Dadi sea in Badagry at about 3:35pm on February 26. “The boats were loaded with 71 bags of rice, two gallons of groundnut oil (25 litres each), 30 cartons of frozen foods, three Yamaha boat engines,” he said. The commandant warned criminals to stop their acts of sabotage, stressing that the agency would not relent in the fight against pipeline vandals and other criminals.
