In what looks like one eating his vomit, the acting national secretary of All Progressives Congress (APC) Chief Victor Giadom said the party will respect the intervention of President Muhammadu Buhari. Giadom led National Working Committee (NWC) last week insisted that the emergency National Executive Committee meeting will hold as planned, but made U-turn following the intervention of the President that led to the indefinite suspension. Reacting to the last minute indefinite suspension of Monday’s emergency National Executive Committee meeting on a telephone interview Giadom said, “the decision of the President, who is the leader of the party and in that regards the NEC meeting slated for 17th March has been postponed indefinitely. “The party will respect the intervention of Mr. President,” Giadom stated. When asked the new date for the NEC meeting, the acting national secretary replied, “the public and members of NEC will be informed of the new date, but as for today and agreement with the President, the NEC meeting is postponed.”
