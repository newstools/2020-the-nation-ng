 The Diagnostic Centre at the University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan, Oyo State, has been certified by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and is now functional. Governor Seyi Makinde, who disclosed this on his tweeter handle, said the development would improve turnaround time for testing.  He said the dusk to dawn curfew between 7pm and 6am took effect from Sunday, adding that there should be ‘no gathering of more than 10 people anywhere in Oyo State’. According to him, all markets will also be closed except those selling perishable food items. He said: “Inter-state transportation into and out of the state has been suspended from March 29, except vehicles carrying food items, medical, pharmaceuticals and petroleum products. All measures will be reviewed weekly.”
