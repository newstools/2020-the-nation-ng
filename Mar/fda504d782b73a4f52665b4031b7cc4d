The Human and Environmental Development Agency (HEDA) has tasked the media to beam its searchlight on the sector particularly those saddled with administration of sports. The group believes the media as the watchdog has ignored the sector and this has made many administrators to milk the sector without any attendance result. At a two-day seminar tagged ‘Tackling Corruption and Underdevelopment of Sports in Nigeria: Investigating Reporting for the Common Good and Sports Development’, the group blamed the rot in the sector on the culture of silence pervading the media. Ghanaian-born investigative journalist, Anas Aremeyaw Anas lamented the rot in the sports sector across the continent which he said has affected the fortune of the sports adversely. “It is high time the media do more investigative stories to unearth the rot in sports. Many of those in charge of sports are there to enrich themselves and it is time for the media to dig deep into them so that sports can benefit an ordinary man on the streets. “We (media) cannot pretend all is well in sports and from my experience it obvious that there are more stories that are yet to be done on the sector particularly on those who administer sports,” the award-winning journalist said. Other speakers at the forum included  Head of Communication and Media, Access Bank Lagos Marathon, Olukayode Thomas, Abuja-based lawyer, Abdul Mahmud, Eze Alloysius, Executive Director Of Playya Nigeria and Director of Sports, MFM, Godwin Enakhena.
