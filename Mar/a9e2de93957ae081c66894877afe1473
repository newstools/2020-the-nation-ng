 Due to growing insecurity situations in the country, the management of the University of Benin has cancelled all field trips by its staff and students. This was because of the abduction of some of its lecturers and students who were going to a field trips in Igarra, Akoko-Edo local government area. It was quick response of some vigilance groups backed by policemen and hunters that led to the rescue of the abducted staff and students. A statement by the spokesman of the university, Dr. Benedictta Ehanire, said the field trips were suspended because of current security situation and recent expenrinces of some students. Dr. Ehanire, however, noted that if any field trips became neccessary, adequate secuity measures should be put in place or security escorts demanded. Meanwhile, the UNIBEN chapter of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) said the abduction of four lecturers and eleven students of the institution was a reflection of failed national security that has the capacity of crippling the entire education system. A statement signed by its Chairman, Professor Monday Omoregie and Secretary, Dr. Fabian Amaechina urged security agencies to live up to the responsibility. According to the statement, “Insecurity is a virus that needs to be exterminated because of the negative multiplier effect it can have on education and the larger development of the nation. If researches and field works cannot go on because of the challenge of insecurity, then the educational sector and the whole concept of national development will be on borrowed time. “The larger picture is that it has the capacity the crippling the entire educational system. The larger consequences will be utterly grievous”.
