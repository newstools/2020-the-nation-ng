The Department of State Services (DSS) has declared the report that it is laying siege to Premium Times is false. According to a statement by the Public Relations Officer of the DSS, Dr Peter Afunanya, the report that the phones of one of the staff of the media organisation was hacked by them was also untrue. He described them as unfounded and needless sensationalism. The statement reads: “The report that the DSS is laying siege on Premium Times and has hacked the phones of one of its staff is false in its entirety. It is unfounded and just a needless sensationalism. “There is no such operation at the moment by the Service targeted at the Premium Times, its Editor or staff. If there is any need for the DSS to discharge its duty, it sure has to do that with every sense of decency and in accordance with laid down procedures. “Now, the Service is not anywhere near the news agency. Therefore, the report should be disregarded. It is fake news.“
