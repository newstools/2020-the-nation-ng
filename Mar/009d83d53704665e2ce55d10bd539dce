By Victoria Adepoju  It was celebration galore at the 14th speech and prize-giving day of Fountain Heights Secondary School, Surulere, Lagos. At the event, pupils who recorded exceptional performances in various subjects for the 2018/2019 academic session, won prizes. In JSS1, no fewer than nine pupils received various prizes, with the duo of Oluwatobiloba Adeoye (12 prizes) and Oghenerume Agbaire (15 prizes) emerging as top awardees. Thirteen pupils were also celebrated in JSS2 where Chidinma Isinguzo and Adaeze David went home with 12 and 13 prizes; while eight pupils were celebrated in JSS3. With 12 prizes, Simisola Adepoju topped in SS1 where 12 pupils were honoured; while 13 pupils received prizes in SS2.  The event was not only about academic excellence as six pupils were recognised for their diligence. While six students received prizes for their good conduct, 13 others were celebrated for their leadership qualities. In her speech, Principal of the school, Mrs. Adebimpe Delano, congratulated the prize winners, saying it was not easy to meet the stringent cut-off criteria in the subjects. She also challenged those who did not win awards not to give up but redouble their efforts. She said: “Students of Fountain Heights are being brought up to be responsible, independent, hardworking, dedicated and balanced. These minds are trained to expand and become young selfless leaders who will stand for what is right. Standing for what is good and right is more important than academic achievement but both go hand in hand because in the words of Dr. Samuel Johnson, ‘integrity without knowledge is useless and knowledge without integrity is dangerous and dreadful.”
