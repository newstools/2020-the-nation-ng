Chairman of the National Association of Nigerian Students, Ogun State chapter, Bamgbose Tomiwa, has said the government shutting down schools nationwide in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic isn’t the right step to take. Tomiwa was reacting to the directive by the Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, to close down schools in the state to prevent the spread of the virus. The Federal Government had, last weekend, ordered that schools be shut for a month beginning this week. Tomiwas told CAMPUSLIFE: “Concerning Coronavirus, I think the public needs to join hands with the government to prevent this virus from spreading. We can see cases of countries where this virus is very rampant. We can see how it has grounded them economically and otherwise. “Personally however, I do not support government shutting down schools in Nigeria because Convid-19 is not as widespread in Nigeria as it is in other countries. “It (coronavirus) is not yet as widespread as we have in other climes.  Nevertheless, that doesn’t mean that we need to fold our hands and wait till it gets out of hand before necessary actions are taken. However, I think the closing down of schools is not necessary for now. “Government should set up a  health committee that will be located in major places in the state, and across the entire local government so  that it makes it easy to track individuals that demonstrate the symptoms of the virus. “Another thing is that the government should embark on wide sensitisation campaign about the coronavirus, and also encourage the use of hand sanitisers. If possible, they should make available hand sanitisers and face masks free for citizens. Closing the down the school is not the next step to take for now.” Tomiwa announced plans by NANS to embark on an awareness programme in tertiary institutions in the state. He said: “We are creating awareness about it on our campuses and making sure that students don’t serve as an agent of spreading such virus.”
