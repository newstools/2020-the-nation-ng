 OMORINMADE Kuti, the first grandson of legendary Afrobeat pioneer, Fela Anikulapo Kuti, joined his father’s Positive Force band in September 2018. Upon joining the band in an impromptu manner, Made has been busy working on his art. In the last 18 months, the member of the third generation of Fela Anikulapo Kuti’s clan has been busy getting himself settled into his father, Femi Kuti’s Positive Force band. And to this end, Made had made some landmark achievements even though he tries to remain humble noting that he has more to do.  Aside from touring with the band and meeting several dignitaries, Made had also met with the international band, Coldplay, during one of the Positive Force band. He has also become a regular face at the New Afrikan Shrine, where he performs with his father’s band. Made, the only son of Funke and Femi Kuti, graduated from the Trinity College of Music, the United Kingdom where he bagged a Bachelor of Music (Honours). Made joins his grandfather, Fela, who is also an alumnus of the institution.
