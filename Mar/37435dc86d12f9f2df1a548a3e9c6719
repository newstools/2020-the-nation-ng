The Mona Audu Foundation (MAF), has concluded plans to commence the distribution of N50 billion worth of relief materials across Nigeria, starting from April 3, 2020. Disclosing this in a statement, issued in Abuja on Friday, the Convener of the Foundation, Princess Zahrah Mustapha Audu, said the effort is aimed at helping Nigerians live through the harsh conditions accompanying the outbreak of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Among items for distribution would be masks and hand sanitizers, bags of rice and beans, cartons of Indomie Noodles, bags of tomatoes, cartons of Maggi, bags of pepper gallons of vegetable oil and other food items. The Mona Audu Foundation, which was founded by Prince Mustapha Audu and his wife, Zahrah Mustapha Audu, in 2016, had been involved in providing jobs, healthcare, education and other charity services to people across Nigeria, especially in Kogi State.
