 THE Basketball Africa League (BAL) today postponed the league’s inaugural season, which had been scheduled to tip off Friday, March 13 in Dakar, Senegal. According to BAL President Amadou Gallo Fall, the league was postponed due to the escalating health concern related to the deadly coronavirus. He said: “Following the recommendation of the Senegalese government regarding the escalating health concerns related to the coronavirus, the BAL’s inaugural season will be postponed. I am disappointed we are not able to tip off this historic league as scheduled but look forward to the highly-anticipated launch of the BAL at a later date.” The BAL, a partnership between the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) and the NBA, is a new professional league featuring 12 club teams from across Africa.  The BAL builds on the foundation of club competitions FIBA has organised in Africa and marks the NBA’s first collaboration to operate a league outside North America.
