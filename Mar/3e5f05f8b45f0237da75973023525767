 A LAGOS High Court will on May 5 hear a suit by a firm, Crompton Resources Ltd, against Eat N’ Go Ltd, the master franchisee of Dominos Pizza, Coldstone Creamery and Pinkberry. The plaintiff is praying for an order compelling the defendants to pay it N34million “being the outstanding debt owed the claimant by the defendants”. Crompton Resources, through its counsel Inemesit Inyang, also seeks N2.5million as punitive damages and N1.5million as cost of the action. The construction firm said it was engaged by the defendants in 2018 to build some of its outlets in Lagos. The plaintiff said it designed and equipped the defendants’ outlets on 434, Old Ojo Road, Satellite Town; 1, Ologolo Village Road, Ologolo, Jakande, and at Iju Ishaga, all in Lagos. Crompton Resources said it obtained loan facilities for the projects in hope that the sum will be liquidated upon completion. It added that it incurred liabilities due to the defendants’ alleged refusal to pay the outstanding N34million balance despite several demand letters.
