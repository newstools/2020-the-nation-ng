Former Minister of Sports Bolaji Abdullahi has warned Kwarans against abusing hand sanitisers as a preventative measure against Coronavirus pandemic. He said sanitisers should not be used to wash the teeth or as body cream. The former minster spoke  in Ilorin while donating 3,000 sanitisers to the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ); Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW). Others that benefited from the donation were community associations within Ilorin West Local Government Area. Abdullahi, who was represented by Chairman of Omoluabi Movement, Babatunde Sidiq, said: “Unfortunately, many of our people here have misconstrued the use of sanitisers. It is expected of all of us to apply sanitisers after washing our hands as many times as possible. Sanitisers are not meant for consumption. Incidentally, many people have misconstrued the disease as not airborne but water borne. “They think they can use it to wash their mouth or as body cream. This should not be the case. It’s essentially meant for our hands.”
