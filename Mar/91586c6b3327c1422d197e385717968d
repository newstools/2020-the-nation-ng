The Ondo State Task Force on COVID-19 has taken its sensitisation tour to traditional rulers. Led by the Commissioner for Health, Dr. Wahab Adegbenro, and Special Adviser to Governor on Transport, Tobi Ogunleye, the task force said the sensitisation was to enable the message reach the grassroots easily. At the Olowa of Igbara-Oke’s palace, Adegbenro said the state was ready to curtail any suspected or reported case of COVID-19.  He appealed to Oba Adefarakanmi Agbede to educate his subjects on the need to regularly wash their hands with soap and clean water, use hand sanitisers and maintain social distancing. The commissioner said the Ministry of Transport would ensure that commercial drivers complied with the directive limiting passengers to a given number. He reiterated that the government’s priority was to secure its people, and so it would take every precautionary measure to curb the spread of COVID-19. Oba Agbede told the team he has suspended all meetings, large gatherings and other related activities in and around the palace as part of preventive measures mandated by the government. He hailed Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu for the prompt action at ensuring that the state is free of COVID-19.
