Gbenga Bada  New reality TV show, Ultimate Love, is getting more attention from viewers as couples now seek public votes to remain on the show. After about five weeks, three couples (six contestants) have been evicted while one contestant voluntarily quit the show. Here’s a quick check on the lovebirds that have been checked out of the Love Pad for failing to amass the required public votes. The duo of Michael and Cherry (MiCherry) were the first couple to be checked out of Ultimate Love after only two weeks in the Love Pad. The couple was evicted after they received the least number of votes out of the five nominated couples from the voting public. It was, however, not all gloom as the couple went home with N350,000 in their portmanteau after they played the Jeopardy game on stage. On Sunday, March 8, the duo of Jerry and Meriton (Jeriton) were checked out of Ultimate Love after a total of four weeks in the Love Pad.  The couple became the second couple to bid the Love Pad goodbye after they received the least number of votes out of the seven nominated couples from the voting public. They, however, went home with N600,000 and other items in their portmanteau, after they played the Jeopardy game on stage. The duo of Jenny Koko and Louis (Jelo) were checked out of Ultimate Love, after five weeks at the Love Pad. The couple became the third couple to leave the Love Pad on Sunday, March 15 after they received the least number of votes out of the four nominated couples from the voting public. They, however, went home with N100,000 and other beautiful gifts after they declined to play the Jeopardy game on stage. Meanwhile, five couples were nominated for possible check-out during the live nomination show on Sunday, March 22. The couples as announced by the show’s hosts are DoubleChris (Chris and Chris Ville), Jaykech (Jay and Nkechi), Bolar (Bolanle and Arnold), Obiebi (Obichukwu and Ebiteinye), and Iykeresa (Iyke and Theresa).
