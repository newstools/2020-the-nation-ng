From Andrew Abba, Abuja  Ahead of next weekend’s Africa Zone FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup first leg qualifier against Burkina Faso, Falconets Moses Adiku has decamped 12 players out of 37 that began camping two weeks ago. Adiku who spoke after the training, said he retained 25 players to enable the technical crew concentrate and work on the lapses already identified. He said the Burkinabes were not push over in female football especially at this level and every Africa nation want to be represented at FIFA-organised competitions, adding “our players have advantage due to their involvement in our domestic league. “I have requested for the match tape of Burkina Faso. You know this is football, you can’t underrate any team. Women football is fast growing in Africa unlike before when our national teams had easy passage in both CAF and FIFA-organised championships.  “My target is to win the first leg in Ouagadougou with wide margin like what the Flamingoes did to Guinea by beating them 6 -1 to make the return leg a formality.  My joy is that some of the girls are not new to international competitions. “The girls also know the importance of the qualifier and only the best I will be selected for the match. For now the camp is injury free and I pray it continues to be injury free throughout our qualifiers,” he said. The Falconets yesterday played a scoreless draw with Nasarawa Amazon in a friendly match after they lost 2-1 to Abuja U-17 Boys in their  first warm up game. The  2020 FIFA U-20 Women’s  World Cup will be co-hosted by  Costa Rica and Panama in August.a
