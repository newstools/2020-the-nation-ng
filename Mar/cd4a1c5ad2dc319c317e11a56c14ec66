 NEWLY invited Super Eagles forward, Cyriel Dessers said he was in cloud nine after earning his first international call up to the Nigeria national team. The Heracles Almelo of Holland striker was included in Gernot Rohr’s 24-man squad released on Wednesday for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying fixture against the Leone Stars of Sierra Leone this month. Dessers, who has scored 15 goals in 25 Dutch top-flight outings this season, said he is honoured and proud and can’t wait to wear the national team jersey. “So honoured and proud. Can’t wait to wear the Green-White jersey and meet the team! Flag of Nigeria @NGSuperEagles #naija,” the 25-year-old posted on his Twitter account. The Super Eagles will host the Leone Stars on March 27 in the qualifier before heading to Freetown for the return leg at the Siaka Stevens Stadium four days later. Nigeria are currently sitting top of Group L on six points, having won all two of their fixtures to date.
