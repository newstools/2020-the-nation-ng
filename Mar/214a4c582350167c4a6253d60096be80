 The Body of Senior Advocates of Nigeria (BOSAN) Port Harcourt branch has recommended card reader for future elections. It likened the card reader to a gatekeeper that can assist in sanitising the electoral process. BOSAN stated this in Port Harcourt at a valedictory court session in honour of the retiring President of the Court of Appeal, Justice Zainab Bulkachuwa. Dr T. C Osanakpo (SAN), who spoke on half of the group, praised the appellate court for approving card readers in a suit marked CA/PEPC/002/2019. He lamented that the Supreme Court did not affirm that judgment could have helped to reduce the challenges emanating from election petitions. “Permit me to say that under your leadership, the Court of Appeal gave legitimacy to card readers, which is indeed in my view, a gatekeeper that would have assisted immensely towards sanitising Nigerian electoral process for overriding public interest.  “I submit with humility that if the apex court and indeed a policy court of the land had affirmed the stance of your court, the contemporary electoral challenges and hurdles which we experience in Nigeria would have been substantially resolved or checkmated. “It would have put the country in the right trajectory of evolving and developing sustainable electoral process that will affirmatively impact on the Nigerian democracy in the interest of the Nigerian State and her citizenry.” BOSAN praised Justice Bulkachuwa for successfully juggling her home and career duties. “My lord, you epitomise the fact that a woman can multi task. I say so respectfully because apart from your daunting judicial duties, extra judicial responsibilities, you are a wife to Ambassador Adamu Bulkachuwa, mother to your children which show that you equally have a family life with attendant family obligations and duties. “Your ability to combine your judicial duties all these years without blemish and attendant family obligations and duties are noble and equally worthy of emulation,” Osanakpo said.
