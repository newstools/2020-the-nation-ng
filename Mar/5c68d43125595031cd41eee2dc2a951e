 NIGERIA’s fully integrated telecommunications company, Globacom, has announced its partnership with the organisers of the  Africa CEO Forum holding in Cote D’Ivoire. For the second time, Globacom is lending support to Jeune Afrique Media Group and Rainbow Unlimited to host the gathering of the continent’s top business leaders. The telecommunications company said in a statement in Lagos yesterday that it is the Diamond Partner of this year scheduled for March 9 and 10. Discussions will centre around “Capitalism for the many, a new horizon for the African private sector”. The forum attracts heads of governments, Chief Executive Officers (CEOs), international investors, experts and high-level policy makers, who brainstorm on various aspects of business and how to facilitate economic growth on the continent. Globacom expressed hope that this edition would provide a platform for decision makers to identify ways to improve intra-African trade and investments. The company said the sponsorship was part of its efforts to support initiatives that nurture Africa’s economic potential. The edition sponsored last year by Globacom was held in Kigali, Rwanda, and drew the participation of over 800 chief executives of multinational companies and over 1,800 participants from 70 countries.
