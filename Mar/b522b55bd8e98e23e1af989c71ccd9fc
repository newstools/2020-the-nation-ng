 Nollywood producer, Katheryn Fasegha has postponed the release of her new film, ‘2 weeks in Lagos’ over the spread of coronavirus across the world. Fasegha noted that due to the prevalent epidemic challenge facing the world, the release of the film which was planned for March 27 has been postponed. Speaking to The Nation, she said, “The Safety of humanity is much more important to us than any possible profit. Though we have invested so much in the release of this film, our investment and sacrifice cannot take precedence over those who are battling to survive Covid-19, those who have lost their lives and those who are tirelessly working to ensure that humanity is preserved by finding a solution to this scourge.”  Continuing, Fasegha says she firmly believes that profit should never take precedence over the wellbeing of humanity. The film practitioner says a new date will be fixed for the film release as soon as the scourge is over.  Fasegha also implores fans and movie buffs to be safe and take necessary precautions. The film practitioner shuttles between Nigeria and Canada where coronavirus is currently raging its citizens.
