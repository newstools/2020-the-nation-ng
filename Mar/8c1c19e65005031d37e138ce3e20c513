Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde has ordered the renovation of classrooms and supply of furniture to St. John Secondary School, Ode-Aje, Aremo, Ibadan, and other worst-hit schools in the metropolis. The governor, who gave the order during an on-the-spot assessment to the school, said the government will try its best to ensure the schools are fixed as quickly as possible. Makinde added that other public schools with deplorable facilities would be addressed soon to improve the quality of education. He said: “This is unacceptable; we will try our best to fix the situation as quickly as possible. The commissioner is here; the Teachers’ Service Commission (TESCOM) chairman and the permanent secretary are also here. “I will engage the community leaders, and if there are carpenters in this neighbourhood, they will make chairs for you immediately. If there are bricklayers here as well, they will fix this.” The governor, who lamented that education has suffered in the last couple of years, the terrible condition in the school couldn’t have happened overnight or suddenly. He said the government had been working to uproot cartels trying to sabotage the administration’s free education policy. According to him, the policy is being resisted by those who benefitted from the corruption of past years through acts of internal sabotage. He warned that his administration would deal with remnants of the cartel as the government is determined to provide qualitative education for children.
