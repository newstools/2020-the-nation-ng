According to the latest report by El Chiringuito, at least 12 Valencia players have tested positive for coronavirus. The club in a statement on Monday said: “Valencia CF inform that new positive cases of the COVID-19 coronavirus have been detected amongst first-team staff and players. “Despite the strict measures adopted by the club after playing a UEFA Champions League game on February 19, 2020, in Milan, an area confirmed as high risk by Italian authorities days later, distancing the squad for their work environment and the public, recent results show that exposure to those games has caused a 35 per cent positive result rate. “All of these persons are now at home, in good health and obeying self-isolation measures. “Besides providing further information over the coming hours, the club reiterate our support for the health authorities and their social awareness campaigns, and emphasise to all of the population the importance of staying at home and continuing to follow the previously published hygiene and illness-prevention measures. “Likewise, Valencia CF reiterate our confidence in the Spanish health system, and in the recommendations made by the Ministry of Health for cases of coronavirus infection such as these.”
