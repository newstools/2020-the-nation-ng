 Many companies have hurriedly postponed indefinitely or rescheduled their annual general meeting (AGM) as the pandemic Coronavirus continued dislocation of the global and domestic capital markets. Nigerian equities closed weekend with a net loss of N279 billion for the week, representing average decline of 2.35 per cent for the five-day trading period. As confirmed cases of Covid-19 infection quadrupled and governments announced closure of schools and curtailment of large socio-religious gatherings, quoted companies have postponed their scheduled AGMs of shareholders, a development that may lead to delay in corporate decision-making. Notore Chemical Industries Plc, which had scheduled its AGM for this Thursday, stated that it was postponing the meeting indefinitely citing the safety of its shareholders, employees and other members of the public. Shareholders of Notore had been scheduled to consider and approve a N40 billion capital raising proposal aimed at strengthening the balance sheet of the agro-allied company. Notore stated that it would continue to monitor the situation to determine a new date for the AGM. Greif Nigeria Plc, which had scheduled its AGM for next week, said it has rescheduled the meeting to June 2020 citing the Covid-19 outbreak in Nigeria. Greif Nigeria stated that it has taken further measure of placing a travel ban on all its employees while advising that meetings with larger groups of participants of more than five persons, whether external or internal, should be avoided. According to the company, large gatherings are discouraged and alternative methods or rescheduling of such meeting is therefore advised. “Greif is concerned with the safety and health of its employees, their families and the general public at large,” the company stated. Greif believed that the only way to truly reduce the spread of the virus is with social distancing for as long as possible until this recedes.

Concerns had risen over the safety of large gathering of shareholders and other stakeholders at AGM. With shareholders’ base of most companies in thousands and the large number of other stakeholders usually at AGM, the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) issued a circular advising all quoted companies that plan to hold meeting to put in place adequate precautionary measures to ensure the safety of all stakeholders. Not less than seven companies had scheduled to hold meeting in the next three weeks. Shareholders of Africa Prudential were scheduled to meet today at the AGM in Abuja. Four other companies- Transcorp Hotels, Morison Industries, Transnational Corporation of Nigeria and United Bank for Africa (UBA) had announced that they would be holding their AGM this week. Nigeria’s largest financial institution, Guaranty Trust Bank had scheduled its AGM for next week while Nigerian Breweries and Custodian Investment planned to meet in April. According to the Exchange, companies that plan to hold their AGMs in the near future should adopt the safety procedures provided by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) in preparation for their AGMs. Such companies must also adequately communicate these procedures to all invitees to the AGM. The NSE however noted that companies that wish to postpone their AGMs or are yet to schedule their AGMs, must comply with extant rules and regulations on the timeline and conduct of AGMs. According to the rules, companies must hold their AGM within nine months from the end of their financial year end or within such extended period as may be approved by the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC). Section 213(1) of the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) 2004 stipulates that “every company shall in each year hold a general meeting as its annual general meeting in addition to any other meetings in that year, and shall specify the meeting as such in the notices calling it; and not more than 15 months shall elapse between the date of one annual general meeting of a company and that of the next”. Section 213(1)(b) of CAMA meanwhile permits the CAC to extend the time within which an AGM may be held by a period not exceeding three months. “The Exchange advises all listed companies to strictly adhere to communications and advice from the health authorities at the NCDC, World Health Organization (WHO) and Lagos State and Federal Ministries of Health in the effort to tackle this dreaded virus,” NSE stated.
