HE attended the event to cheer his son, Tosin, who enjoyed seven nominations with his first film at the Multi Choice Video and Movie Awards last Saturday. His first choice was to fly to Sokoto for the raucous glee of the annual Argungu Fishing festival. He settled for the genteel glamour of the movie night. His children urged daddy to dress well for his son. A coup it was. It turned out to be a father and son night, though. Son Tosin won in the editing category, and Igho the father bagged a lifetime award or industry merit award for setting the stage for Nollywood with his NTA classics like Cock Crow at Dawn, Mirror in the Sun, et al. It was the first time father and son won in the same night. Father and son were due for the deuce.
