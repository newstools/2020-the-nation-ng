The International Olympic Committee has said the Games could still begin on 24 July despite the coronavirus pandemic causing other events to be cancelled. Coe told BBC Sport: “Let’s not make a precipitous decision when we don’t have to four months out.” However, he added: “If you had to ease that date, you’d have to ease it. It is possible. Anything is possible.” Speaking yesterday on BBC Radio 4, Coe, who was chair of the London 2012 organising committee, also said: “Events are changing by the hour but it is not a decision that has to be made at the moment. We’re trying to manage the situation with the information we have but there is not a great deal of information. The temperature in the room with the IOC is, nobody is saying we’re going to the Games come what may.” The IOC says it held “constructive” talks with athlete representatives about the coronavirus crisis earlier this week. President Thomas Bach admitted he was “confronted with many questions” over qualification and restrictions but insisted that “everybody realised that we still have more than four months to go” until Tokyo 2020.
