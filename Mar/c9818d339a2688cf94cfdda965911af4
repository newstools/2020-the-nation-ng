A section of a three-storey residential building was on Thursday gutted by fire along Moore Street in Onitsha, Anambra State. The inferno which started around 9.45am from one of the flats  was said to have been caused by electrical fault. A witness, David Umeri, said he was having his breakfast when he heard shouts of fire. He said, “I quickly suspended my food, locked my shop and rushed to the scene. But before I got there, people were already using water to quench the fire.” The man who said his house was five buildings away from the affected structure, said men of the Fire Service who arrived later were unable to put out the fire until the Red Cross intervened. “Thank God for the intervention from the Red Cross and residents, otherwise, the fire would have extended to the main market,” he added. Police spokesperson, Haruna Mohammed confirmed the incident, saying the fire was put off by firefighters. He said there was no loss of life in the incident. Commissioner of Police John Abang has ordered a thorough investigation into the incident.
