Everyone needs a chance to attain greatness. Every talent needs a platform where it can be showcased. Ibrahim Kasim, better known as Kaskeed, is highly gifted. Perhaps, the only missing ingredient is a platform to show the world his gift.  But the youngster is resolute and he kept pushing hard until the world paid attention to his music. In a chat with Social Circuit, Kaskeed said he had seen music as a medium to express himself from childhood. The undergraduate of Federal University of Technology, Minna, stated: “I believe through my music, many lives will be blessed and that I can inspire people in my country and the world at large. Music has given me the ability to express my emotions as a person, and my music speaks about love, happiness as well as unity. “There might be many obstacles trying to kill your dreams but the onus is on you to never stop believing in yourself. And in any situation, we should always strive for the best and give God the glory. I try to let people understand that nothing is too big and nothing is too small. Your story can change in just a second.” He is also lucky. He has a supportive mother who believes in his talent and can climb mountains to help him achieve greatness.
