A non-for-profit organisation. Musa Halilu Ahmed Foundation, committed to promoting good health and wellbeing for the underserved in Nigeria, has embarked on a state-wide coronavirus relief effort by distributing prevention kits to residents in Lagos. It distributed thousands of kits at Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH) to prevent spread of the virus. The fight against the novel coronavirus being spearheaded by the foundation is borne out of its proactive drive to help citizens and government fight the virus, which is gradually spreading across the country.  “Never has it been more critical to prepare, provide and protect underserved communities in Lagos state from the lingering disease burden. The choice of donating protective kits to frontline responders and marginalised residents was a deliberate decision made by the foundation in a bid to consolidate governments effort in halting the spread before it becomes an uncontrollable epidemic,” Founder and Executive Director of the Foundation Alhaji Musa Halilu Ahmed – Dujima Adamawa the 1st, stated. The Management team of Lagos State University Teaching Hospital led by Prof Fabamwo commended the effort of the foundation, stating that the act was laudable at a critical time the government alone is unable to fight the pandemic. He encouraged other organisations to take a cue and emulate the gestures of the foundation in ensuring the spread of the coronavirus remains minimal. The foundation’s team was lead by Mr Sam Ejiwunmi, who urged all Nigerians to take precautionary measures at all time.
