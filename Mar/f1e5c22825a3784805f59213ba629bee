 The Managing Director, Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC), Mr. Fidet Okhiria, has said work is ongoing on the Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge rail line despite the Coronavirus outbreak. Okhiria, who spoke on Wednesday in Lagos at the Maiden Awards Ceremony/Inauguration of Office Secretariat of the Transport Correspondents Association of Nigeria (TCAN), said track laying would reach Ebute-Metta Junction by March end. The managing director, who was given the Award of Excellence in Rail Development, said although the COVID-19 had affected virtually every sector, the China Civil Engineering and Construction Company (CCECC), the contractor handling the project, had not stopped work.  The Chairman, Board of Director, NRC, Alhaji Alhassan Musa, who received the 2019 Award of Pillar of Railway Development in Nigeria, hailed the TCAN for recognising his efforts in rail transport, noting that it would encourage him to do more. Musa, who dedicated the award to members of the board of directors, described the award as a feedback mechanism for him, saying it would further help him to put in more efforts towards the modernisation of railway. Lagos State Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) Mr. Hyginus Omeje said that only an intermodal transportation system would reduce congestion and carnage on the road. Omeje, who received the award of 2019 Road Safety Ambassador, decried flagrant disregard of road traffic rules and regulations, which he said had led to avoidable crashes and fatalities. The Minister of Transportation, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi, who was represented at the event, was given 2019 Doyen of Rail Transport Development Award.
