A former domestic staff of a high court judge, Peace Anyawu, was on Monday arraigned before a Lagos Magistrate court in Igbosere for allegedly stealing jewellery valued at $38,000. Prosecutor Sgt. Chinedu Njoku told the court that Anyanwu, 22, and two others conspired to commit the alleged offence. Njoku said the incident took place at D5, Millenium Estate, Lekki Phase 1, Lagos, between July 2019 and October 26, 2019. He said the stolen jewellery belonged to Justice Bola Okikiolu- Ighile. The defendant pleaded not guilty. Anyanwu’s alleged  accomplices also pleaded not guilty.  Nevertheless, the court declined to grant them bail. Magistrate Botoku ordered that the case file be duplicated and sent to the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP), for legal advice. The case was adjourned until March 23.
