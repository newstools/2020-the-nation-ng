A Federal High Court in Lagos has convicted a gateman, James Paul Tuksa, of terrorism, threat to life and fraud. Tuksa was found guilty of obtaining N5million ransom from a complainant after threatening to kill him and his family. Justice Ayokunle Faji convicted the defendant on Friday, and adjourned till March 20, for sentencing. The office of Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) arraigned Tuksa on May 25, 2017, on a two-count charge. He pleaded not guilty. After trial began, the government amended the charge to three counts and Tuksa repeated his plea. The AGF’s counsel Mr O.C. Anigbogu said Tuksa committed the offence while he was a gateman at 4a, Ibironke Crescent, Parkview Estate, Ikoyi. The court heard that Tuksa, sometime in October 2016, phoned one Victor Omotayo Awosika, of 2, Ibironke Crescent, Parkview Estate, Ikoyi, and threatened to exterminate him and his family, unless he was paid N5 million. Awosika paid up. During his trial, the prosecutor called two witnesses and tendered four exhibits including the defendant’s statement. Tuksa’s extra-judicial statement and a closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage were tendered also. Tuksa testified in his defence.
