 Parents have praised the Federal Government for shutting schools to mitigate the spread of coronavirus. President of the National Parents’ Teachers Association of Nigeria (NAPTAN), Malam Haruna Danjuma, told The Nation that the government took the right step. He said: “I think it is the in order because it is being done in good faith.  During Ebola period NAPTAN and the NUT reached out to the government to direct all schools to close until when it is safe. “So when we heard the government had closed because of the Coronavirus we were happy. We are in support.” Danjuma said schools should be re-opened only when government was sure diagnostic methods had improved. With some classes having up to 100 pupils, Mr Neye Solomon, a parent and member of the Community Surveillance Platform in Agege, said closure was the best course of action. Parents’ Forum Chairman’s, University of Lagos (UNILAG), Mr. Babatunde Majekodunmi said the move was good. “It is for our own good. Let the government be able to contain the virus,” he said. However, with pupils missing out on classes during the long holiday, Danjuma called for an adjustment of the school calendar. “What I expect of government is that when they order the reopening of schools they should look into the calendar and make necessary adjustments,” he said. While at home, the parents suggested that students be kept busy with tutorial classes. “Parents should enrol their wards for extra mural classes. We are in the age of technology. Some tertiary institutions, especially the private schools, are able to offer classes online,” he said. Mr. Majekodunmi said parents should not relent in monitoring their wards so they do not engage in the wrong activities. However, as tertiary students are adults, he advised them, especially those at UNILAG to spend their time studying because their examination were close before the school had to shut down.
