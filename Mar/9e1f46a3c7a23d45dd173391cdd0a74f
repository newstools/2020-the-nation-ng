Former Nigeria striker and coach Daniel Amokachi has named former Chelsea midfielder John Obi Mikel as the greatest Nigerian player ever. Mikel enjoyed a successful international career with the Super Eagles before his retirement last July. He played at two FIFA World Cup tournaments in 2014 and 2018, won the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations in South Africa and later guided the national team to a third-place finish at AFCON 2019 in Egypt. The former Chelsea and Middlesbrough midfielder also won the UEFA Champions League and Europa League amongst other domestic titles during his stint at Stamford Bridge. Mikel started his Nigeria career at the 2003 FIFA U-17 World Cup before playing at the 2005 World Youth Championship where he was named the tournament’s second-best player behind Lionel Messi.  Amokachi believes the feats Mikel has achieved in his 16-year football career distinguishes him from every other Nigerian player. “Mikel is the greatest player,” Amokachi told Brila FM. “He has won everything that a player can hope to; the Champions League, Europa League, AFCON in 2013 and he also captained the national team. “As a footballer, your laurels count and that will surely count for Mikel because nobody has won that much in Nigerian football.” Mikel is currently a free agent after ending his two-year contract at Turkish Super Lig club Trabzonspor by mutual consent this month. The 32-year-old played 19 league games for the Black Sea Storm, who sit at the summit of the Turkish top-flight standings.
