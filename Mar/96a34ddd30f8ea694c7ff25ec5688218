Human rights and justice group, Our Nation for Justice Initiative (ONAJI), has charged Governor Prince Dapo Abiodun MFR to stand by his Youths and Sports Commissioner Dr. Kehinde Oluwadare following his alleged disrespect to statesman Chief Segun Osoba. ONAJI in a strong-worded statement signed by its secretary Folarin Oluwole said Governor Abiodun and all men of good will in the state must take the steps to end a wave of blackmail against the active Youths and Sports Commissioner. Delegates from (ONAJI) who visited the Ijeja Sports Complex in Abeokuta on Tuesday to witness the commissioner’s rallying support for athletes preparing for the now postponed Edo 2020 National Sports Festival, were full of praises amidst criticisms of the said uncomplimentary comments against the state’s former chief executive. “The campaign against the Youth and Sports Commissioner was staged to cause chaos and commotion among APC as a party and this should not be allowed to stand,” Oluwole said in a statement signed by ONAJI’s executive media officer Deacon Stanley Onulogun. “The Commissioner for Youth and Sports has apologised in several mediums about the misconception over his speech and we know he meant no harm and can never disrespect an elder statesman in Baba Segun Osoba. “We hereby offer apologies on behalf of our hardworking sport commissioner and plead with the youths and elders to ignore those who just want to pull him down.” The group further called on Governor Abiodun to stand with his chosen young and vibrant sports commissioner, adding Oluwadare’s presence in the Ogun State executive cabinet means the world to the teeming youths of the Gateway State.
