By Oziegbe Okoeki  The Lagos State House of Assembly on Thursday lifted the suspension on four of its members. The Speaker, Hon. Mudashiru Obasa made the announcement at the start of plenary. Obasa said the Governorâ€™s Advisory Council (GAC) and the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, called a meeting on Tuesday to intervene in the crisis and directed that the House should reinstate the suspended lawmakers. The affected lawmakers are Hon. Olumuyiwa Jimoh, who was removed as Deputy Majority Leader; Hon.Rotimi Abiru who was removed as Chief Whip; Hon. Moshood Oshun and Hon.Raheem Adewale who were suspended. The Speaker was, however, silent on if the removed principal officers were reinstated to their former positions or if they are to continue as floor members and chairmen of committees he had assigned them to during the crisis. Their indefinite suspension was announced at the plenary of March 9 and the affected lawmakers and their staff had since then been denied access to the Assembly complex with their offices sealed up. The Nation reports the GAC held a meeting with the Speaker and the four lawmakers concerned at the Lagos House, Marina on Tuesday with the Governor and Tinubu in attendance. The meeting was called to put an end to the crisis that has been rocking the Assembly in the past three weeks. It was reported that the GAC, which is the highest political organ of the party, told the lawmakers to go and settle themselves and report back. It was also reported that the GAC did not want to start apportioning blames but insisted that the lawmakers must settle themselves so that peace would return to the Assembly that has always been peaceful before the present development. They also were not happy that the House, which is made up only of only APC members could be allowed to degenerate to the level of crises.
