The order banning begging in Niger state is yet to take effect as beggars, especially the Almajiri, are still seen everywhere in Minna metropolis carrying out their usual business. It would be recalled that last week, the state government declared a total ban on begging in the state as the government declared that anyone caught begging would be made to face the consequences. A tour around Minna metropolis yesterday showed that it is still business as usual for the beggars and the Almajiri have continued their begging which includes going from house to house asking for food. Most of the Almajiris interviews by The Nation revealed that their ‘Mallams’ have not informed them to stop begging and they did not know anything about the ban against begging. Some of them said that their Mallams are the ones who push them out to beg, saying in pidgin, “If we no beg, we no go chop. They no dey give us food for where we dey. They just drop us there and na we dey take care of ourselves, I one of them who identified himself as Kabir told our Reporter. Another beggar, Rilwan said that begging is the only means for survival for them adding that while they get to eat the food, the money is usually submitted to their Mallams in the night before they sleep. “Begging is our only means of feeding because any money we get must be submitted to our Mallam in the evening when we retire back home.” Some of the Almajiris bragged that they cannot be stopped by the government to stop begging as they claimed that it is part of them and acceptable in the north. Apart from Almajiris, other beggars are also being seen across the city capital, especially the famous Mobil roundabout, begging as usual.
