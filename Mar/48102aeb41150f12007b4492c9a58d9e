Okungbowa Aiwerie, Asaba Gunmen have invaded Isselle-Asagba Community in Aniocha South L.G.A Delta State, killing a middle -aged man and abducting a 17- year- old girl. A source, who spoke to The Nation, said the incident occurred about 7:45pm. He stated the suspected abductors have established contact and were demanding N10 million ransom for the release of the girl. The source said the community vigilante group has launched a search party for the rescue of the girl unhurt. The source said: “It happened last night (Wednesday) at about 7.45pm, when shootings went on simultaneously at three areas of the town by some hoodlums. “We are suspecting they were same herdsmen that came to our school premises, killed one of our Teachers, abducted our Principal, shot two teachers before the community youths and vigilante, joined by mobile policemen, rescued them in sometimes in October last year. “The community have of recent come under attacks, which led to the death of a school teacher with others receiving various degree of injuries that kept them in hospital till early last month. “As I speak the entire community has gathered at the palace, while the vigilante men have entered the bush, trying to trail them and see if they could rescue the girl. “But the kidnappers have called and are now asking for N10 million ransom. The girl’s mother was spared, perhaps because she is nursing a little baby.” Efforts to reach the Delta Commissioner of Police, Mr Hafiz Inuwa, proved abortive.
