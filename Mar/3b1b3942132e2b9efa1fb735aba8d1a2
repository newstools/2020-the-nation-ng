Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun has dissociated himself and his government from unguided comments by Commissioner for Sports, Oluwadare Kehinde, which were found disparaging to the person and administration of former Governor Olusegun Osoba. Abiodun, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Kunle Somorin, apologised to Osoba, saying the comments do not represent the views of the government about him. The governor also apologised to the late Chief  Lam Adesina (Oyo State) and former National Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief John Odigie-Oyegun (Edo State), who were equally disparaged in the comments. The statement reads: “Governor Dapo Abiodun received the uncomplimentary comments of the commissioner with dismay, disbelief and shock. The words were infantile and distasteful.  These comments are not a true reflection of the disposition of the governor and the government, and the high esteem that Chief Olusegun Osoba is held. “There is no doubt that Chief Osoba’s repute is timeless and transcends Ogun State and many spheres he has stamped his authority, for him to be a subject of such a careless remark. Chief Osoba is an accomplished journalist, consummate politician, altruistic leader, and a very forthright compass for the progressive community in Ogun State, Southwest and the country. “Abiodun is proud to be associated with Osoba and remains grateful for his role in bringing the current administration in place. His role as a pillar of support will continue to stabilise the Dapo Abiodun Administration. “The governor dissociates himself and the administration from Kehinde’s unsavoury comments, and reassures all that this unfortunate incident will not impede the cordial relationship between Baba and himself. “The governor apologises to Chief Osoba and other leaders affected by the comments, and reiterate that they are not a reflection of the person, standing, and background of Aremo Osoba.”
