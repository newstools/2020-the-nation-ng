 Barring any minute development, a former Protocol Officer, Government House, Mamman Eri is to head the Kogi State Independent Electoral Commission. The screening of Eri and seven other names, newly forwarded to the legislative arm for confirmation by Governor Yahaya Bello, is presently ongoing on the floor of the state house of assembly, in Lokoja, the state capital. This is coming ahead of the planned composition of the State Independent Electoral Commission (SIEC) to herald preparation for the conduct of council elections in Kogi State. Governor Bello had had earlier nominated an eight-man state independent electoral commission, the screening of which was put on hold following allegations that the nominees were card carrying members of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, in the state. Following the protests that greeted the earlier composition, Bello represented a new list of the SIEC members to be headed by Eri, who recently retired from the state civil service. Shiru Lawal, a former council (Lokoja) administrator was to head the commission.
