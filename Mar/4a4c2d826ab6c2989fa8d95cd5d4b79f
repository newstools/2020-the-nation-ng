The Chairman of the Badagry local government, Hon Olusegun Onilude, has created an emergency isolation centre in order to prevent and contain the spread of the dreaded corona virus disease, Covid-19, in the local government area. A press statement made available by the media aide to the Chairman, Mr Sewedo Samuel, during the week said the isolation centre is located at Saint’s Thomas Primary School, Badagry. Onilude said the centre is headed by the Medical Officer of Health (MOH) of the council, Dr Michael Ariyibi, who will serve as the Technical Director of the centre. “The people in the local government area are expected to report to this centre whenever they have any of the symptoms of the disease like, incessant coughing, chest pain, dry throat and inability to breathe well or have had contact with anyone infected ” The council boss said in order to ensure strict adherence to the directive of the Lagos State governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, limiting a social gathering to a maximum of 20 people and keeping a reasonable distance of one metre, the council has set up a task force headed by the Vice Chairman of the council, Hon Andrew Akotomeh, to enforce compliance until the pandemic has been declared under containment by the World Health Organization (WHO) and National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). Onilude said the local government had taken adequate measures to forestall the failure of the preventive measures to protect all residents in the local government area against the disease by bridging the communication gap between the people and government by employing “our age-long means of communication, the Town Crier, who have been mobilised to swing into action. The Town Crier is saddled with the responsibility of informing the general public, most especially those without internet access, on measures taken by the government, such as social distance, isolation of those with the symptoms and provision of numbers to reach designated emergency health facilities and agencies in the state and local government are, ” he said.
