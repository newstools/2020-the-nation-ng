 A Chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Uche Nwosu, has appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to intervene in the crisis rocking the party. Nwosu noted that President Buhari is the father of the party and will administer justice,which will heal all grievances and restore peace and progressive ideals on which the party was founded. “It will take the intervention of the President as the leader of the party to restore peace and harmony in the party,” he stated. Fresh crisis is rocking the party after a High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) suspended the National Chairman, Adams Oshomhole. Nwosu maintained that it is imperative for President Buhari to wade into the crisis because he is respected by all the leaders of the party and as such can amicably resolve the matter. According to him: “The crisis in our party should not be allowed to continue beyond this that is why I am appealing to President Muhammadu Buhari to intervene as the father of the party and bring the warring factions together and resolve the issues”. He added: “It is also obvious that it is only the President that can resolve the crisis in the Edo state chapter of the party ahead the governorship election. “Anyone thinking that the party will continue to grow stronger in the middle of all these crises is being economical with the truth. “We need peace in all state chapters of the party to stay strong and deliver on the party’s manifesto,  the crisis should not be allowed to distract the President from delivering the Next Level Agenda which he is seriously committed to”.
