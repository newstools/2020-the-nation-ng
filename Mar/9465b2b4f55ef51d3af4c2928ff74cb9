 THE Minister of Youth and Sports Development Sunday Dare said yesterday  that  Edo 2020 National Sports Festival (NSF) will not be postponed due to the fear of the spread of Coronavirous. Speaking through the Director of Planning and a member of the Main Organising Committee, Peter Nelson, and Dare said: “The 2020 Edo National Sports Festival is on track and will go on as scheduled. There is nothing to be worried about. The Minister has directed the setting up of an isolation centre (during the Games) to take care of any case of the virus. The Director of Sports Medicine is working closely with the Edo State Government to ensure a hitch-free Festival. We have no doubt that everything will work well.” Nelson added: “The rumour about the postponement is unfounded and emanating from mischievous people whose wish cannot come to pass. We are on top of the situation and we are going to have a very successful Festival.” He further assured that the Ministry embarked on an inspection last week and all the facilities were almost ready with finishing touches being put in some. To underscore the importance and readiness for the Games, the Minister had met last week with officials of the Ministry of Health and a delegation of WHO to collaborate on how to curb communicable diseases like tuberculosis and other viral infections. The Edo 2020 National Sports Festival is billed to hold from March 22 to April 1.
