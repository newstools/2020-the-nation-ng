Arsenal will continue to pay all of their matchday and non-matchday staff until April 30, despite there being no matches due to the coronavirus crisis. There will be no Premier League football until April 30 at the earliest, leaving football club employees – both part-time and full-time – without work during the pandemic. But Arsenal have made a move to ease the financial concerns of their staff by vowing to pay them all even without matches taking place. Arsenal’s managing director Vinai Venkatesham said in a statement: ‘We are truly grateful for the outstanding efforts of all our staff across the club every day. We rely on their tireless service to provide a first-class experience for our fans on matchdays and non-matchdays. “These are challenging times for everyone, but in particular our casual workers. This gesture is intended to ease their financial uncertainty while football is currently suspended to 30 April 2020. “We are truly grateful for the outstanding efforts of all our staff across the club every day. We rely on their tireless service to provide a first-class experience for our fans, on matchdays and non-matchdays. “We look forward to welcoming football back to Emirates Stadium as soon as possible.” Arsenal players, meanwhile, will not return to training as was initially planned on Tuesday, although manager Mikel Arteta has recovered from coronavirus.
