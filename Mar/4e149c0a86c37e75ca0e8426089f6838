The Management of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Osun State has urged the general public to discountenance the rumour that the Dean of Student Affairs, Dr. Isiaka Aransi has contracted Coronavirus. Some blogs over the weekend rumored that the Dean of Student Affairs of the university contracted coronavirus and has been quarantined. When the Public Relations Officer of OAU, Mr. Abiodun Olarewaju was contacted on phone by our correspondent, he slammed the report. He said the claim that our Dean Student Affairs contracted Coronavirus is satanic and immoral. His words, “It is satanic, unheard of and immoral to claim that Dean of Student Affairs, Dr. Isiaka Aransi of our university has health challenge. “Let it be known to the general public that there are no symptoms of case of Coronavirus on the OAU campus. We are investigating those behind the story and we shall react appropriately.
