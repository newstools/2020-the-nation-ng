 Condolences have been pouring in from friends, families, acquaintances and well-wishers of the late Mr and Mrs Emmanuel Uduakonobi, the young couple who died in the recent Lagos explosions. According to sources,the couple being devout Catholics returned from their usual Sunday mass around 9 am and the incident occurred around 9:21am. Emmanuel’s mother who was living with them was not around as she attended the second service that took place much later. “They were married for two years and were expecting their first baby. The wife, Chisom, was a first-class graduate of accounting from the Zenith University, Ghana and was ACCA certified. “Chisom worked at Rain Oil Depot as an accountant until her death. She was the first and only daughter in a family of five. “Her husband Emmanuel was a banker turned businessman. He was said to be very influential,”a source said. The source said: “She was a very good chef and was always happy and very jovial”. One of Chisom’s relatives who described the unfortunate incident graphically said: “Emmanuel’s car got completely burnt and thier residence was completely ruined. The fence fell on Chisom, therefore shielding her from the raging fire. It was her husband and her that lived in that part of the compound. He was burnt beyond recognition”. “Chisom’s upper torso was burnt, leaving behind her spinal cord, face and her shoulders that made us recognise her. It was a very gruesome sight indeed”. The family members of  Chisom who live opposite Navy Town, Ojo Barracks, Lagos, are said to be gradually recovering from the shocking incident.
