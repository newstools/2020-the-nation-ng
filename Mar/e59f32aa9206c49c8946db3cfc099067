Sterling Bank Plc has entered into partnership with a non-governmental organisation (NGO), Health Emergency Initiative (HEI), to provide emergency medical assistance to accident victims and patients in emergency wards in public health institutions. Under the partnership, HEI trained two cohorts of emergency medical responders to reduce fatalities and permanent disabilities caused by dearth of pre-hospital emergency care. Apart from bridging the first responder gap, the NGO is working to  close identified skill gaps among emergency workers while also assisting destitute patients in public hospitals with treatment not exceeding N20,000. Mr. Obinna Ukachukwu, Divisional Head, Education & Health Sectors, Sterling Bank Plc, who disclosed this at a press conference in Lagos  said the bank decided to partner with HEI as part of its commitment to improve quality of lives of the Nigerian people through its HEART strategy. He explained that the bank is focusing investments on five sectors of the economy – Health, Education, Agriculture, Renewable Energy and Transportation in a bid to make impact, adding that Sterling Bank believes strongly in responsible business practices.
