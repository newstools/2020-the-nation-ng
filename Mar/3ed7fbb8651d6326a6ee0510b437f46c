 There is no time as to when the Boko Haram and other terror groups will be eliminated, the Military has said. The Coordinator, Directorate of Defence Media Operations, Maj.-Gen. John Enemche, while fielding questions from reporters at the Defence Headquarters in Abuja, noted that even though the end of the Boko Haram insurgency and other terror acts in the Northeast is very close, the Military will not give the exact date or time that it will take place. According to him, giving a timeline on Military activities will be counterproductive and undermine the element of surprise, which is a potent weapon in warfare.  He said the troops in the theatres of operation are eager to end the Boko Haram and Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP) insurgency. Maj.-Gen. Enemche said: “I can assure you that the Boko Haram and ISWAP will soon be a thing of the past. The terror groups have been degraded and pushed into the fringes of the Lake Chad. The number of them surrendering to troops confirms that the days of the terrorists are numbered. “Right now there is confusion among the terror groups and the troops are capitalising on it and intensifying the push. I am very sure that we will see the end sooner than we think, but it is improper to give exact timeline. That will be like sounding them off.” He said the Military is committed to ending the insurgency as quickly as possible.
