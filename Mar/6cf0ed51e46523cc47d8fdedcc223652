Paulo Dybala has told Juventus fans that he and his girlfriend Oriana Sabatini ‘are good’ just four days on from news they had tested positive for coronavirus. The 26-year-old forward stunned the world of Italian football when he announced that he had contracted the deadly virus but he appears in high spirits while the pair quarantine at home. Writing on his Instagram page, where he made the announcement that he was COVID-19 positive on March 21, Dybala wrote ‘estamos bien’ (‘we are good’) to caption a photo of him doing an OK hand gesture. Juventus, who were the first club in Italy to see a player test positive for the virus when confirmation arrived that Daniele Rugani had got it, soon confirmed that Dybala was at home and doing well. ‘He has been in voluntary home isolation since Wednesday 11 March,’ they wrote at the weekend. ‘He will continue to be monitored, following the usual regime. He is well and is asymptomatic.’ Dybala became the third Juventus player to test positive after defender Rugani and midfielder Blaise Matuidi. He has been active on social media to ease concerns over his well-being and has kept busy along with his girlfriend. Italy has been the worst affected country to date with more than 74,000 positive cases of people infected with the virus. There have been, at the time of writing, more than 7,500 deaths as the country continues to fight the further spread of the virus. A host of Serie A players have gone public after testing positive and it remains unclear when the league will be able to conclude the 2019-20 season. Dybala’s Juventus currently sit top of Serie A after 26 matches, one point ahead of Lazio, and nine ahead of Inter Milan, who have played a game less.
