 Chairman of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) University of Lagos UNILAG, Dr. Dele Ashiru has condemned the suspension if the institution’s 51st convocation because the Pro-Chancellor, Dr. Wale Babalakin claimed the management did not seek the Council’s approval. In a WhatsApp chat with The Nation, Dr. Ashiru said Babalakin should have used internal procedures before escalating to the Federal Ministry of Education in Abuja. Ashiru accused the Pro-Chancellor of imperialism and said he was trying to discredit public university system because of his private university agenda. He said: “As you may be aware the agenda of Wale Babalakin and his pay masters is to discredit the Nigerian Public University system as inefficient in order to justify their call for the privatization of universities. Available evidence reveals that the matter was discussed in Council. If Babalakin was not satisfied with that why did he not resort to internal procedures and processes in resolving the issue. In view of this ASUU UNILAG condemns in the strongest terms this wicked, inhuman, egoistic and satanic postponement of the convocation ceremony of our great University in order to massage the over bloated ego of an imperial Pro-Chancellor.” Dr. Babalakin did not reply text message on how the UNILAG management breeches due process to fix the convocation for next week.
