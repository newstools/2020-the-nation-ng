A data scientist, Mr Adewale Omoniyi, has said that the absence of coordinated data in Nigeria may hamper the accuracy status of coronavirus (COVID-19) management in the country. Omoniyi, who is an internationally certified statistician and the founder of JOINNIGERIA, an NGO promoting and creating awareness about the data-driven approach, noted that Nigeria might suffer appraisal problem during the ongoing COVID-19 crisis due to the absence of data which will make it difficult to accurately plan, support and assess activities during the period. According to Omoniyi, this is the period that measurable results through data are the energy needed to both reduce the virus and cushion the economic effects on households across the country. The platform also promotes a data-driven approach in solving the problems of Nigeriaâ€™s government, entrepreneurs and startup businesses through social impact initiatives. He noted that solutions to the problems of COVID-19 are inseparable from the statistics.
