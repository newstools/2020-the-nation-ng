The speaker of the Imo State House of Assembly, Collins Chiji has ordered the member representing Nkwerre State Constituency, Mr. Obinna Okwara to leave the hallowed chambers when he suddenly started coughing and sneezing during the plenary. This came as the speaker also has advised the member representing Owerri North State Constituency, Mr. Philip Ejiogu to observe strict self-isolation following his recent return from the United Kingdom. At the House’s last plenary for the week, Mr. Okwara’s sudden sneezing caused pandemonium as his colleagues who sat close to him started shifting away from him. Other lawmakers in the chambers quickly reached out for their nose masks and handkerchiefs and wore them. When the sneezing became very constant and started distracting the proceedings at the plenary, the speaker ordered Okwara out of plenary, advising him to check himself properly. The lawmaker was seen walking into his office and never came back to the plenary afterwards. Earlier on Tuesday, the speaker also ordered the member representing Owerri North State Constituency, Mr. Philip Ejiogu to observe strict self-isolation following his return from the United Kingdom recently. Ejiogu had returned to the country last week after he had visited the United Kingdom. He joined his colleagues during the plenary and was seen hugging his colleagues, especially Amara Iwuanyanwu and Uche Ogbuagu who were elected the deputy speaker and majority leader of the house respectively. According to the speaker, the lawmaker may have been exposed to COVID-19 (Coronavirus) during his visit to London. Chiji explained during the plenary that the lawmaker may have come in contact with one of the confirmed cases in the United Kingdom, where the virus is spreading faster.
