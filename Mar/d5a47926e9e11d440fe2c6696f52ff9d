The House of Representatives on Wednesday intervened in a 10- year old blackout in Ife South Local Government Area of Osun State. The Green Chamber urged the Federal Ministry of Power to carry out comprehensive inspection and evaluation on the communities to ascertain the level of damages on the transformers, with a view to rehabilitating them. It also mandated its Committee on Power to interface with the Benin Electricity Distribution Company (BEDC) and the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) on the disconnection of electricity in Ife South Local Government for the past 10 years and investigate the outrageous bill of over N50 million allegedly owed the company and report back in four weeks for further legislative action.
