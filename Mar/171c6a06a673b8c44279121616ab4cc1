Lagos State Commissioner for Local Government and Community Affairs Dr. Wale Ahmed has advised members of Community Development Advisory Council to take ownership of government projects in their communities. Ahmed spoke at the inauguration of newly-elected members of the Lagos State Community Development Advisory Council and valedictory service for former members. He enjoined them to utilise the projects. The commissioner noted that CDAC comprised responsible and selfless people willing to contribute their quota and use their experience to develop Lagos State, using the T.H.E.M.E.S agenda of the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration. Ahmed advised the council to represent the government well at the grassroots by taking ownership of government projects in their communities. He urged them to report members with contrary and anti-progressive agendas or ideas. A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Cardinal James Odunmbaku, counselled the new members to support the government. Odunmbaku, the life patron of CDAC, urgedÂ  members not to cut corners, saying they should play their part well by backing the government to succeed and making Lagos to excel. CDAC Chairman Alhaji Azeez Amusat thanked members and the government for believing in him. He said he would not disappoint them, promising to make accountability, openness and probity his watchword.
