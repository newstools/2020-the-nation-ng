 Kano Pillars head coach, Ibrahim Musa has urged that his star striker, Auwalu Malam Ali to be more clinical in front of goal despite the players’ nine league goals for Sai Masu Gida this season. Ali was the club saviour in Makurdi last weekend when his two goals helped Pillars salvage a point against Lobi Stars but Musa revealed that the striker still has a lot to improve on to be a complete goalpoacher. The Kano Pillars gaffer affirmed that Ali could be wasteful at times and that the forward must improve on that aspect of his game to enable him bury the chances he gets better in future games. “I can say that Ali is helping us a lot. He was very important to the point we got against Lobi Stars,” Musa said. “But before he got those two goals to increase his goals tally to nine he wasted some chances against Lobi Stars and in previous games too. He needs to be calm while in the goal area. Ali’s nine goals is second to only Ndifreke Effiong (Akwa United) and Israel Abia (Rangers International) who have 10 goals apiece, while the Pillars hitman is on nine along with Enyimba’s Victor Mbaoma.
