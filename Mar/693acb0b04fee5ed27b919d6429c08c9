Chairman, House Committee on the Environment, Lagos State Assembly cum-actor, Desmond Elliot has taken the Coronavirus campaign to his Surulere constituency home with support from the Nollywood family. The campaign powered by Elliot but headed by top movie producer and director, Chico Ejiro had the likes of Zack Orji, Paul Obazele, Segun Arinze, Angela Phillips, Torino, and Obi Osotule among others, distributing flyers and sanitisers to Surulere residents at different locations. The campaign tagged; ‘Corona Virus (COVID-19) Public Advisory’ with the hashtag; ‘#LagosAgainstCoronaVirus’ advised the general public to ‘monitor yourself closely and diligently during the self -quarantine, to identify if you develop symptoms including but not limited to the following, cough, fever, shortness of breath, feeling of being ill, headache and diarrhea.’ Head of the campaign Chico Ejiro said: “This sensitisation is very necessary because such pandemic needs constant reassurance that all is not as bad as it seems. We are reminding them of what to do to stay alive. It is a big burden on Desmond Elliot. He wants the best for his people and at times like this; he is expected to do what he is doing as he has always done. So, we are telling the people not to forget to wash their hands, use hand sanitisers, they should try as much as they can to avoid touching their eyes, nose and mouth, avoid contact with sick persons, cover a cough or sneeze, keep their distances and stay alive.” The public was also encouraged to immediately contact the Lagos State Ministry of Health on the numbers provided.
