Our Reporter LIVERPOOL forward Mohamed Salah could set a new Premier League goalscoring record when his side welcome Bournemouth to Anfield in tomorrow’s lunchtime. The Egyptian is expected to return to Jurgen Klopp’s starting lineup after being named among the subs for Tuesday night’s 2-0 FA Cup defeat at Chelsea – Liverpool’s third loss in their last four games.  However, they are heavy favourites to return to winning ways at home to relegation-threatened Bournemouth this weekend as they bid to move to within nine points of their first title in 30 years. Part of the reason for the odds being so heavily in favour of Liverpool is Salah’s phenomenal record against the Cherries, which has seen him score in all five of his previous Premier League meetings.
