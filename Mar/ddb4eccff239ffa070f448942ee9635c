Abubakar made the disclosure during the inauguration of one block of 20 rooms transit accommodation at 271 NAF Detachment Birnin Gwari on Monday. He said that the establishment of the detachment had helped to reduce crimes in Birnin Gwari, adding that the deployment of more troops would strengthen the onslaught against bandits, kidnappers and terrorists. Abubakar noted that a lot more needs to be done, not only in Birnin Gwari but across the country, to ensure the safety of all Nigerians. “The NAF is constantly reviewing its tactics, techniques and procedures as well as emplacing additional measures to effectively add value to the operations we are conducting so as to ensure the security of life and property, thereby preserving the territorial integrity of Nigeria. “As part of our efforts to improve welfare of personnel for service delivery, the NAF embarked on the construction of befitting accommodation in all NAF locations within the six geo-political zones of the country. “The personnel of 271 NAF Birnin Gwari are equally not left out of this development, hence, the provision of this 20 one-bedroom accommodation built to provide a place of rest after a hard day’s job. “Let me state, that this project we are about to commission today is a product of our commitment to improve on personnel welfare. “ he said The Air Chief said the structures would be named after those personnel that paid the supreme price in the line of duty.
