The President Muhammadu Buhari administration is the worst in the nation’s history, Presiding Bishop of Living Faith Church Worldwide also known as Winners Chapel, Bishop David Oyedepo, has declared.
He also dismissed the hate speech bill sponsored by Senator Sabi Abdullahi as the most ridiculous. Oyedepo spoke on Sunday in a sermon during the second service of the church at the Faith Tabernacle, Ota, Ogun State. He lamented that while government was planning to clamp down on hate speech, it was allowing killers to walk away. Killers, as against hate speaker, he said should be dealt with and not vice-versa. According to him: “The government in this country is making a draconian law – hate speech. They said if you speak hatefully, you have committed murder. “Out of someone who says I will kill you and the one who kills, who has committed a crime? I don’t understand which kind of animal farm we live in. “I said stop stepping on my toes and you said that is hate speech but somebody kills and he is walking free on the streets. “This is the most stupid and nonsensical ideal anybody can think of. “I said you are bad and you said that is a crime. Must I say you are good when you are bad? “In my view you are bad and you shouldn’t be a leader. I have the right to say so. As far as I am concerned, I am a true born and thoroughly-bred Nigerian, an intelligent one. ‘’In my view this is the worst thing that has happened to Nigeria — this government. It is the worst and in fact it is like a curse.” He added: “I have been here for some time and I led the first prayer and fasting for Nigeria in 1979. I am not a baby in the affairs of Nigeria. ‘’This is the worst government, a government with no direction. Their days are numbered. I can tell you as a prophet that their days are numbered.”
