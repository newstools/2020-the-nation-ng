 President Muhammadu Buhari is holding a close-door meeting with the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, at the State House. The agenda of the brief meeting, which began around 1pm, was not known as at the time of filing this report, however, sources said the point of discussion would be centered around state matters. A source from the office of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, who spoke under conditions of anonymity, revealed that issues discussed revolved around, primarily, the crisis rocking the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). He also said the duo discussed the opposition facing President Buhariâ€™s quest to get a $22.7 billion loan, especially from the South-East caucus of the House of Representatives. The projected loan, according to the Buhari administration, would be dedicated to execute critical infrastructure projects. The Nation also authoritatively learned that the embattled National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, visited the Chief of Staff (CoS) to the President, Mallam Abba Kyari. Though the reason for the visit was unknown as at the time of filing this report, sources familiar with the meeting suggested it might not be unconnected with the travails bugging the party at present.
