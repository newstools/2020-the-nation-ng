 A three-year-old girl identified as Favour was on Sunday night rescued underneath the rubble of one of the collapsed buildings at Abule-Ado, The Nation learnt on Monday. The child’s mother and brother both sustained critical injuries and were said to be unconscious in the hospital. It was also gathered that the child’s father was yet to be found as at 1pm on Monday, a development that has fuelled suspicion that more people could still be trapped. The Nation gathered that officials of the Red Cross found the toddler naked and partly covered in debris. An official who spoke to our Correspondent said the organisation administered First Aid to over 40 people. Chairman, Red Cross Nigeria, Adebowale Kolawole, said the child’s mother sustained head injury and was semi unconscious. “She woke up this morning and asked for her daughter. Doctors told her she was safe and with the Red Cross. We are happy she is at rest psychologically with her daughter being safe so that the pains she is going through will not increase. “As soon as possible we are taking her to go see her mother at the Naval Hospital. She is Favour and God has favoured her,” he said. Meanwhile, two more bodies were yesterday recovered from the debris of Bethlehem Girls’ College, bringing the deadtoll to 19. The bodies were said to have been recovered around 11am while excavation was being carried out.
