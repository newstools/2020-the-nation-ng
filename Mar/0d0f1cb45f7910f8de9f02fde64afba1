The founder of West Africa Theological Seminary (WATS), Ipaja, Lagos State, Dr. Gary Stewart Maxey has said the institution would continue to maintain its lead as a leading seminary in the continent of Africa. He said this while explaining why 18 academic and two administrative staff were sacked. He said the mission to deliver on the promises of providing good and sound theological leaders by the seminary was important and cannot be compromised. Maxey said the academic staff had to be asked to go because their services were no longer required because they were teaching undergraduate courses, which the seminary was no longer ready to run. He explained that when the seminary started 1982, it was running vocational, Diploma, undergraduate and graduate programmes. But that after ten years, it scrapped the certificate and diploma programmes. According to him, “WATS has been on a long trajectory. WATS is moving to true global seminary status as obtainable in America. WATS is moving forward not backward. We want to put our resources and energy where we are doing best. And that is in our graduate programme.” He said that the level of theological education is rising globally and as such, WATS must adjust to meet the dynamism of the time for progression.
