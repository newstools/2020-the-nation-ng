 Ogun State Government said it has identified 32 persons, who had contact with a new case of coronavirus in the state. The Commissioner for Health, Dr Tomi Coker, disclosed this while briefing journalists in Abeokuta. Coker said the new case involved a 62 – year- old resident of Sagamu while contacts included four family members and 28 healthcare givers. The Commissioner noted that the new index case returned from the United Kingdom on March 17 and tested positive after showing coronavirus symptoms. He said the patient had been taken to the state’s isolation centre at the Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital (OOUTH), Sagamu.  She said: “Today, we have a newly confirmed case of COVID-19 in Ogun State. The said case is a 62-year-old male who resides in Sagamu and he had history of recent travel, returning from the United Kingdom on the 17th of March. He presented with history of cough and was tested and the test came back positive. “All his contacts have been traced; 28 healthcare givers and four members of his family. Thirty-two altogether. He’s been very responsible by isolating himself since he arrived, therefore he’s made our job quite easy in tracing his contacts.” Coker urged people of the state to always ensure personal hygiene and abide by the government guidelines on social distancing as well as high-density gathering. “But I must say the most effective way of preventing COVID-19 is still handwashing with soap and water for 40 to 60 seconds. That’s more effective even than the sanitizers. So, people should wash their hands frequently,” she added.
