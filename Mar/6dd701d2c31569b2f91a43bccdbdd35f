 Egypt’s Health Ministry has confirmed the first death of a German citizen from the new coronavirus in the country. The ministry’s spokesman Khaled Megahed said in a statement the 60-year-old man landed in Egypt one week ago and showed symptoms of high temperature after he arrived in Hurghada from the city of Luxor. The spokesman said the man went to a hospital in Hurghada on Friday, where he tested positive for the coronavirus. The man was put under intensive care, as he was suffering from respiratory failure caused by an acute pneumonia, the spokesman said. The man refused to be moved to another hospital for quarantine. His condition deteriorated, and he died on Sunday. NAN
