 A MAN dressed in full military uniform was on Friday arrested by the police in Lagos for allegedly flouting the ban on commercial cycles on major expressways in the state. The suspect identified as Yusuf Bello, 38, was intercepted around Mosolashi Bus Stop, Alagbado around 8:30am fully clad in military attire with passengers on an unregistered motorcycle. It was gathered that the suspect who turned out to be an impersonator, usually picked up passengers from Apapa to Agege and sometimes up to Ogun State. He was unlucky on Friday as policemen accosted him for loading passengers on the expressway while in uniform, and impounded his motorcycle. It was in the course of investigation that they found out he was an impersonator. Police spokesman Bala Elkana said military uniforms were recovered from him. “The suspect was also in possession of a fake military identity card. Investigation is ongoing to ascertain the source of the military uniforms and the link the suspect has with other criminal activities like traffic robbery, etc. The suspect will soon be charged to court,” he said
