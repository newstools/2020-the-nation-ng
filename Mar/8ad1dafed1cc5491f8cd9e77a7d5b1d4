 MTN Nigeria has said it is committed to promoting  gender equality in the workplace. In commemoration of International Women’s Day (IWD), MTN celebrated Nigerian women while tackling ‘unconscious bias’ as a hindrance to ensuring a gender-balanced society. The event took place at the MTN Penthouse in Ikoyi and resonated with the global IWD theme – Each for equal, which focuses on the value of diversity and how  individual actions, conversations, behaviours and mindsets can encourage equal representation. MTN Nigeria Chief Human Resource Officer, Esther Akinnukawe, said: “It is undeniable that the push for gender parity and balance has yielded good results,  however, we are not where we should be, but we will get there. Everyone has a role to play in forging a gender-balanced world but as women living within a deeply cultural society, the onus is on us to push harder through our individual and collective actions to challenge stereotypes, broaden perceptions, improve situations and celebrate achievements that showcase the benefits of the gender-balanced world we are trying to create.” The Chief Executive Officer, Chapel Hill Denham, Nigeria, Mobolaji Balogun,  who was the guest speaker at the event, noted that  more Nigerians were becoming aware of the need for gender equality. His words: “To provide equal opportunity for women, we have to begin at the foundation, being strategic and deliberate about solving the challenge of gender equality. Besides that, there is a need to consider the inclusion of government policies that advocate for women,” said Balogun. “A major takeout from this year’s celebration is the realization that the stakes are clearly high and it is imperative that we understand the concept of equality as not restricted to women alone but necessary for economies and communities to thrive,” Balogun reiterated.
