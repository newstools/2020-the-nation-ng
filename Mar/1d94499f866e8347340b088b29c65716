The All Progressives Congress (APC) has advised Governors and other prominent Nigerians who may have had contacts with confirmed cases of COVID-19 to proceed on self-isolation immediately. It also advised for strict and total compliance with all the measures so far announced by the federal and state governments in containing the scourge of the virus. The National Publicity Secretary of the party, Mallam Lance Issa-Onilu, gave the advice in a telephone chat with our reporter in Abuja. No fewer than four APC governors – Abubakar Bello(Niger); Kayode Fayemi(Ekiti); Godwin Obaseki (Edo) and Abudullahi Sule (Nasarawa) are on self-isolation having had contact with persons tested positive of the virus. The APC National Publicity Secrertary whose party shut down it’s National Secretari last week and directed staff and party members to stay at home, said the self-isolation order should not be limited to the governors, their family members and aides but to everybody that had contact with confirmed positive cases. “The ruling party is conscious of the debilitating effect of this dreaded virus. That is why we enjoined not only our governors but all Nigerians who had contact with anyone tested positive to self-isolate and ensure strict compliance with all the precautionary measures announced by government and health officials. “While we encourage all our governors to do the needful, we also enjoin all Nigerians who had contact with positive cases to self-isolate in their own interest and that of the society at large. We have to ensure that we all stay safe,” Onilu advised. The APC spokesperson assured the people of the resolve and the readiness of the ruling party to join hands with other nations and international health institutions to contain the further spread of the Covid-19 virus and to bring the scourge to an end within the shortest time.
