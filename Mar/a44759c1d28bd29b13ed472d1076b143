IN a warning to coincide with Mothering Sunday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson called for Britons not to visit their mothers in person this year. “This time, the best thing is to ring her, video call her, Skype her, but to avoid any unnecessary physical contact or proximity,” the PM said. Johnson added that the numbers of coronavirus cases in the UK “are very stark, and they are accelerating”. He compared the country’s situation to Italy. “The Italians have a superb health care system. And yet their doctors and nurses have been completely overwhelmed by the demand,” he said. “The Italian death toll is already in the thousands and climbing. Unless we act together, unless we make the heroic and collective national effort to slow the spread – then it is all too likely that our own NHS will be similarly overwhelmed.”
