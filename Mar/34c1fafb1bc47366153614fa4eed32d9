Deontay Wilder will fight Britain’s WBC heavyweight world champion Tyson Fury for a third time this summer, promoter Bob Arum has said. The pair drew their first fight in 2018 and last weekend Fury stopped Wilder in the seventh round to win the title. The American had 30 days to call a rematch and Arum, Fury’s US promoter, says he has been “formally notified” by Wilder’s team that they are doing so. Arum told Ringside Reporter the bout will be “before the Olympics in July”. On Thursday, Anthony Joshua’s promoter Eddie Hearn said talks for a heavyweight unification fight between his fighter and Fury were under way. But with the rematch clause triggered, Briton Joshua, who holds three belts, is now expected to fight Bulgarian Kubrat Pulev in a mandatory IBF bout in London in June. And Arum said he could “guarantee Pulev will knock out Joshua like Fury knocked out Wilder”. “I will look at a Pulev/Fury fight to unify the belts at the end of the year,” he added. Meanwhile, Fury’s wife, Paris, hopes her husband beats Anthony Joshua next in a British heavyweight blockbuster before heading into early retirement. She told The Mirror: “I’d like him to beat Anthony Joshua and then stop. He’s in the ring with supreme boxers and it is a dangerous sport. We both know the risks. I know one shot can change everything. ‘If they put all the belts on the line it would be such an amazing fight. I’d like him to take that one fight and retire undefeated. He can’t go on forever, he can’t go undefeated forever. I wouldn’t like to see him continue for too long and get hurt. “I wouldn’t like to see him lose his record chasing money or fame. He doesn’t need that. He’s already cemented his name in the history books.”
