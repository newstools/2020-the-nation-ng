The Police Community Relations Committee (PCRC) in Lagos on Monday donated Coronavirus prevention equipment and materials to the Lagos State Police Command. The items include infra-red thermometers, face masks, hand sanitisers, gloves, buckets fixed with taps and other hand wash materials, among others. PCRC chairman Apostle Kehinde Showemimo said the items would help to shield the officers and men from the virus, in the course of their duties. He pledged that the PCRC would replicate the gesture in all police formations across the state command (Divisions & Area Commands). “We recall that recently in the United States, over 230 Police Officers in the State of New York were infected by Coronavirus in the course of their duties, especially as part of the first responder duties,” Showemimo said. He expressed hope that in carrying out this welfare obligation, the PCRC in Lagos State had contributed towards forestalling any such occurrence in Nigeria. Urging Nigerians to be vigilant and to support efforts to contain COVID-19, Showemimo invited other organisations and individuals to support the Police and other security agencies. Commissioner of Police in Lagos, Akeem Odumosu and a Deputy Commissioner in-charge of Operations and Administration, Mr. Muhammad Alli, commended the PCRC.
Odumosu assured the Committee that the items would be distributed among the men and officers of the Command.
