UEFA has announced the postponement of the Champions League, Europa League and women’s Champions League finals, originally scheduled for May, due to the coronavirus pandemic. “No decision has been taken on rearranged dates,” said UEFA in a statement. All three competitions are currently suspended along with almost every European domestic league because of the coronavirus. UEFA last week postponed the Euro 2020 tournament until next year.
