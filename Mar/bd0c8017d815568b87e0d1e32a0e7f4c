Pay television service provider GOtv has expanded its “Step Up” offer to its subscribers. With this offer, customers will enjoy an array of content available on the GOtv MAX package. The offer tagged ‘Step Up to the MAX Deal’ will see customers who pay for or reconnect on GOtv JOLLI enjoy content on GOtv Max package. This offer, which commenced on 2 March and ends on 30 April, is open to active and disconnected customers on GOtv JINJA, Plus, Value and Lite packages. In addition, customers who pay for or reconnect to a higher package will get an upgrade to the next higher package at no additional cost. This offer comes on the heels of the recently concluded “Step Up,” which only saw GOtv customers pay for their current package to receive an upgrade. With the offer, GOtv Lite and Value customers, who upgrade to JINJA, get a further upgrade to the JOLLI package, while GOtv Plus customers, who step up to JOLLI for only N2,400, get the next higher package, GOtv Max   worth N3,200. “We’ve expanded the Step Up offer to give more customers on lower packages the opportunity to enjoy the varied and quality programming on higher packages especially on GOtv Max. We are essentially offering a discount to our customers as they get to enjoy more than what they paid for”, said Martin Mabutho, Chief Customer Officer, MultiChoice Nigeria. Customers who get the GOtv Max deal will get to enjoy an array of quality international and local programming. These include live broadcast of La Liga and Serie A matches on SuperSport Select 4 and SuperSport Select 5, best of contemporary and Hollywood blockbusters on M-Net Movies Zone (ch 3) and TNT Africa (ch. 16), Cartoon Network (ch. 67)  telenovelas and reality TV programming on BET (ch. 21), StarLife (ch. 23) and Discovery ID (ch. 52).
