The oldest Igbo performing musician alive and Ekpili music crooner, Chief Emeka Morocco Maduka will be celebrating his 60 years anniversary on stage come 23rd and 24th October 2020 in Awka and Onitsha both cities in Anambra State. There will be a public lecture in Awka on the first day and on the second day all roads will lead to Onitsha for the musical fiesta. The 2days event will also feature the participation of other well known musicians. The music festival which was earlier slated to hold on the 6th and 7th of March 2020, was shifted to October due to what the promoters termed “the unfortunate era of Corona Virus that is creating health fears around the world.” Speaking to our correspondent from London, the London based music promoter and president of Morocco Maduka’s Global Fans Club, Mr Eddie Isebor in conjunction with his other friends and coordinators all over the world regretted the shift in date. They however, believed that it is better to postpone the event than stage an event of this magnitude and fans and supporters would refuse to show up due to palpable fears of the epidemic breaking presently in China and already spreading in other parts of the world. Mr Isebor affirmed that sponsors and partners were already signing up in what would be the biggest music festival in Nigeria, stating that the shift is also an opportunity for more partners and sponsors to show interest and properly key into the programme. Chief Dr Emeka Morocco Maduka, the Ukwulu, Anambra born music maestro, started his music career at the age of 14 and is today  the oldest performing musician in the East of Nigeria. He is famous with the Ekpili music genre, who has followers all over the world, including United States of America, Europe, Asia etc has over 120 albums to his credit.
