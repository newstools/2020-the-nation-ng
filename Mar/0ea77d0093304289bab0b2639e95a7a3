 ONE wonders why red lipstick never seems to go out of fashion; the fact is that it is a universal classic and has yet to go out of style. Many women assume they cannot pull it off but they are wrong. Here are some tips to follow. The secret lays in the rest of your face – the paler your skin, the bigger the pop. You should go light on the eyes and blush; otherwise, you will risk looking like a clown. You can skip the eyeliner and make do with only mascara and make sure to apply to bottom lashes, this opens up your eyes. Dust your face with powder and cheeks with a soft blush Line inside of the lips – the lipstick tends to bleed, so fill in the lips with the lip liner first before any other thing. Pick the right colour – if you are light-skinned, you will look better in plum shades, darker girls would be flattered by warmer reds that have a brown base. Do not let nails clash – contrary to what you might think, it is better to go for non-red nail polish when going on red lipstick. A clear and light polish is cool and dark polish is a trend that will not go away anytime soon. If you really want to go with the red polish, then make sure the colour matches your lips. Blend it well – you do not have to stick to one shade of red, try to blend and create the perfect colours. If you buy a red lipstick shade that is too bright or dark, do not dispose it; instead, experiment with other lipstick shades that you have to create the perfect shade of red. Do it light if you are older – the lips get thinner as we age and dark lips accentuate them. To prevent your lips from looking too stern, try a rosy red lipstick shade or you can avoid the red lips altogether and opt for a neutral shade then go ahead and play up your eyes.
