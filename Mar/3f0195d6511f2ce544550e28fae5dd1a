Lagos State Domestic and Sexual Violence Response Team (DSVRT) is leveraging on technology to assist victims of sexual abuses and domestic violence during the period of the lockdown occasioned by the ravaging coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the state. This followed the increase in the number of people calling the team to report abuses by persons taking advantage of the lockdown to perpetuate the dastardly act against unsuspecting persons. DSVRT Coordinator in the state, Mrs Titilola Vivour-Adeniyi said on Tuesday:“Since the lockdown, we have seen an increase in reporting on our hotline- 08137960048. We have added two other lines to compliment the existing hotline with trained personnel. Mrs Vivour-Adeniyi said the development has also made them to move their services online to combat the trend. “We have moved our services online, leveraging on technology to address reporting of Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV). “We have been attending to clients via social media platforms such as , Twitter, Instagram, Whatsapp among others.” On issue of domestic violence, Mrs Vivour-Adeniyi told The Nation that they have been leveraging on conference calls to mediate between parties, and that so far, it has proven helpful in certain cases. She said survivors who believe they are at risk were encouraged to go to a safe place or to a relative or friend’s place during this period. She said on the other hand, the MIRABEL centre at Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), Ikeja and Women At Risk International Foundation (WARIF) were equally encouraged to provide essential medical and psychosocial support to survivors of sexual violence during this period of lockdown. To prevent child sexual abuse, she advised parents to ensure their children remain at home and to pay attention to what they are doing, to avoid sending them on errands at this time to prevent abusers and violators from taking advantage of deserted streets caused by the lockdown and to use this period to create bonds and educate them on child rights and child abuse among others. She also encouraged members of the public to check on their loved ones especially those who have had a history of abuse and if the need arises, to reach out to the team on phone and video calls. She emphasized that they did this to serve as a restraint for the abusers. “We recently partnered with the Nigerian Feminist Forum (NFF) to provide Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) materials to police officers of the family support unit at various police stations in the state in the form of gloves, masks, sanitizers. “Even as they provide response we are interested in their safety. Our clinical psychologists have also been providing psychosocial support via the telephone. “We use this medium to encourage MTN to consider making our line toll free during this critical period as some of our clients are indigent and don’t have the resources to call. We don’t want anyone to die in silence,” she pleaded. She listed numbers that survivors of domestic violence and sexual abuses could call to include: “ DSVRT 0813-796-0048; 0906-288-7843; Office of the Public Defender (OPD)-0708-060-1080; MIRABEL 0815-577-0000; Primary Health Care Board 0803-386-5196; WARIF 0809-210-0009; Ireti Resource Centre 0700-333-3111; Cece Yara 0800-800-8001; Stand to End Rape 0809-596-7000.
