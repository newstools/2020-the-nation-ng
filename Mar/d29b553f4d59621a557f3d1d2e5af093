Activities at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium, Enugu, seems to have come to a halt as the stadium looked deserted and empty, a News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) check reveals. NAN reports that the stadium that was usually full of activities with people and athletes exercising in the morning hours was empty due to  the  Coronavirus  (COVID-19) scare and the suspension of activities of any kind by the Federal Government. It would be recalled  that the Minister for Youths and Sports Development  Sunday Dare recently  instructed that sports  activities of any kind should be suspended. Our  correspondent who visited the stadium yesterday, noted that the place was deserted while the main gate was closed but not under lock and key. Speaking on the situation, the Southeast Zonal Coordinator of the  Federal Ministry of Youths and Sports Development,  Jane Owoh said that federal government ordered for suspension of activities of any kind. She said: ”The minister for youths and sports Sunday Dare ordered that activities of any kind should be suspended. We got the instruction to stop all activities inside the stadium on Monday and we swung into action because lives are involved.” Speaking on the measure to curtail the spread of the Coronavirus,   Owoh said that the office provided washing hand bucket and sanitizer at the entrance of the office. ”We are adhering to the instruction of regular washing of hand and sanitising the hand as well. ”All the staff at the office has been trained on the best way to stay safe even before the government order of work from home,” Owoh said.
