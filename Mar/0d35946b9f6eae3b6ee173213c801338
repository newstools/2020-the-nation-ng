 Nigerian education technology startup, Afrilearn, has been selected for the Orange Corners Incubator Programme. The initiative was developed and funded by the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and implemented by FATE Foundation. In 10 countries across Africa and the Middle East, the programme supports 20 aspiring entrepreneurs every six months with designated work space, capacity building and business incubation services, funding for prototype development and mentoring opportunities. Of the 668 applications for the second stream, 30 entrepreneurs were shortlisted to attend the Orange Corners Nigeria Bootcamp after which Afrilearn co-founder, Isaac Oladipupo emerged one of the top 20 entrepreneurs finalists for the Orange Corners Nigeria Business Incubation, following his outstanding pitch.  Said Oladipupo: “Since my great friend Gabriel Olatunji-Legend and I started building Afrilearn over a year ago, it’s been a very interesting and challenging experience working to solve arguably the greatest challenge of our continent-quality education. But as big as the challenge is, so are the opportunities that lie therein. “For this reason, I’m delighted, not only to have been selected one of the top 30 entrepreneurs, but also to have emerged one of the 20 finalists. “Congrats to other amazing entrepreneurs who made it. Looking forward to unlearn and relearn as we build Africa’s future.” Registered in April last year, Afrilearn is an education technology company actively integrating a network of quality teachers, software developers and animators to deliver richly-animated and curriculum-based secondary education for Africans .
