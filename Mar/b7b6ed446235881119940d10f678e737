Fifty-two indigent pupils in Anambra State have benefitted from the scholarship scheme of Onyebuchi Chris Ifediora (OCI) Foundation. The beneficiaries were selected from public schools in Anambra East, Anambra West and Ayamelum local governments, under the foundation’s Ifedioramma Okafor Memorial Secondary School Academic (IFOMSSA) Awards. OCI Founder Chris Ifediora, who presented the awards yesterday at Fr. Joseph Memorial Secondary School, Aguleri, said about 124 pupils had benefited from the scheme since 2017. Ifediora, represented by the foundation’s legal adviser Steve Ononye, said the awards were targeted at motivating young ones and spurring pupils from Omambala towards greater academic success. He said the scholarship, the fourth in the series, was instituted in honour of his late father, Ifedioramma Okafor, for his firm belief in education. According to him, 15 pupils received the award in 2017; 22 in 2018, and 35 in 2019. He promised to increase the figure annually. He said: “The beneficiaries underwent a one-off examination called the IFOMSSA Challenge, which was held on January 27 before they were selected. The 37 Junior Award winners are Nsugbe indigenes enrolled at the Community High School, Nsugbe, while the 15 senior category beneficiaries were selected across the three councils. “We, at the OCI Foundation, believe in the power of an educated and motivated mind. Such a mind can dream unimaginable dreams, surmount impossible obstacles, achieve the unachievable, and explore limitless opportunities. “The OCI Foundation wishes to give our younger ones the opportunity to bridge the gap between riches and poverty, and to arm them with the tools with which they will overcome failures and attain success.”
