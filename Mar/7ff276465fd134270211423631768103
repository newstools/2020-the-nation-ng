 A 35-year-old man Habeed Kasali has landed in police net for allegedly killing his kinsman he suspected of having an affair with his wife. Kasali, a native of Totowu village in Igbesa, Ogun State, allegedly stabbed Bamidele Johnson, 32, with a scissor multiple times which led to his death. It was gathered that Kasali had on several occasions accused Bamidele of sleeping with his wife, an accusation the deceased was said to have refuted. Kasali was said to have confronted Bamidele once again on Saturday which caused a quarrel between them. A fight soon ensued and the suspect allegedly brought out a scissor which he stabbed the deceased with on his neck, chest and eye regions.  According to police spokesman Abimbola Oyeyemi, the incident was reported at Igbesa Police Division by a family member of the deceased. “They are both natives of Totowu. The incident occurred on Saturday. The suspect confronted the deceased that he was having an affair with his wife despite several warnings and it led to a fight. “In the process, the suspect used scissors to stab the deceased several times on his chest, eye and neck which made Bamidele to lose consciousness. He was immediately rushed to CREST Hospital at Isuti Road in Egan, Lagos but was confirmed dead by the doctor. “Having realised that the victim has died, the suspect took to his heels, but the DPO Igbesa SP Abayomi Adeniji quickly dispatched his detectives to go after him and he was eventually arrested from where he ran to. “The corpse of the deceased has been deposited at Ota General Hospital Mortuary for autopsy. The Commissioner of Police Kenneth Ebrimson has ordered the immediate transfer of the suspect to homicide section of the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (SCIID) for further investigation and prosecution,” said Oyeyemi.
