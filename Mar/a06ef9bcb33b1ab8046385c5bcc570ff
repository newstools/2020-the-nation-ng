As part of steps to check the spread of COVID-19, the Head of Service of the Federation Dr. Folasade Yemi Esan has directed all non-essential public servants on grade level 12 and below to stay and work from home with effect from Tuesday March 24 until further notice. She also strongly advised all other categories of officers who will be at work to limit the number of visitors they receive to the barest minimum. This, she said, is to reduce the physical contact as much as possible. In a circular HCSF/100/S./1/100 dated March 23 issued to all ministries, parastals and agencies the head of service said that officers who have recently visited countries with incidence of COVID-19 or have had contact with persons who recently returned from these countries, are advised to self-isolate at home for two weeks. “In case such officers exhibit any of the vivid 19 symptoms, they are advised to contact the National Centre for Disease Control on 0800970000-10,” she added.
