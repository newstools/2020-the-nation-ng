Road traffic accidents have claimed 287, 759 lives in Nigeria and left 848, 153 others with injuries between 1960 and 2005. The state distribution of the accidents within 10 years (1996 and 2005) shows Lagos leads with 35,323 accidents, Ogun is ranked second with 14,653, Kano and Edo took the third and fourth positions, while Ebonyi and Zamfara had the least number. A Professor of Geography and Regional Planning, Israel Ademiluyi,  who revealed this at the Olabisi Onabanjo University (OOU), Ago-Iwoye, Ogun State, said the figures of deaths and injured followed from the 1, 135,912 accidents that occurred on the nation’s highways within 46 years. Ademiluyi, who was delivering the institution’s 95th inaugural lecture titled: ‘Human Geography and Search for a new Nigeria,” said that the figures were derived from his research conducted in 2007, adding that the accident statistics represented a great loss to the country as well as victims’ families.
