 A Kano High Court sitting at Miller Road has sentenced one Yakubu Dalha of Tsangaya Village in Albasu Local Government to death by hanging. The court presided by Justice Yusuf Ubale Mohammed convicted Yakubu over his complicity in the death of one Zakariyau Bala a.k.a Dangote. The prosecution, led by Abdullahi Bature, brought seven witnesses who all gave evidences against the convicted man. Yakubu engaged late “Dangote” in an argument bordering on political matters; the convict in the process struck his victim with firewood as a result of which the deceased sustained injuries on his head and shoulder. Sergeant Tijjani Sule attached to Albasu police division also in his evidence told the court that he investigated the matter, saying the defendant was arrested and a confessional statement was obtained from Yakubu. A medical official, Dr Abdulkareem Sule, attached to Murtala Muhammad Specialist Hospital in his testimony said that “Dangote” arrived the hospital dead. The prosecution informed the court that the incident occurred on 22nd August, 2012 at Tsangaya village, adding that, when the convict got injured, concerned neighbors and relatives conveyed him to a private clinic located in Dutse, Jigawa State. The clinic in Dutse transferred the injured man to Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital in Kano from where he was further referred to Murtala Muhammad Specialist Hospital, where he was confirmed dead. The convict, who dismissed the testimonies given against him, summoned four witnesses to discredit the charges filed against him. In his judgment, Justice Ubale Mohammed held that the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt, noting that the testimony given by the defense witnesses did not corroborate. Jusitce Ubale ordered that the defendant should die by hanging. “May God have mercy on your soul,” the Judge said.
