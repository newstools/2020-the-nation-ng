Former Super eagles captain Mikel Obi has disclosed that cancelling his contract with Turkish side Trabzonspor was one of the hardest decisions he has ever make. The former Chelsea midfielder in a farewell note to Trabzonspor fans, his ex-teammates at the Turkish Club, the coaches, medical team and the kit manager, thank them for their love while he was with the team. Mikel ended his stay at Trabzonspor after a mutual agreement with the club after he revealed he is not comfortable playing under the current situation in which Corona Virus is ravaging the world.  He wrote on his Instagram page: “I would like to thank all the fans for their support. I also want to say thanks to all my teammates, technical crew, medical team and the kit man Ayatabe for all we’ve achieved this season so far, wish you guys best of luck in winning the league. “ It was one of the hardest decision I’ve had to make, but in current situation we all need take care of our families, spend time with them and protect them. #lifefirst #stayhome #family.” Mikel only joined Black Sea Storm as a free agent on a two-year deal last summer, at the end of his brief stint in the Championship with Middlesbrough. The 32-year-old played a crucial role in helping Trabzonspor soar to the summit of the Super Lig this season with 19 league appearances.
