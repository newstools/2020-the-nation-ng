 The International Centre for Yoruba Arts and Culture will begin operation at the University of Ibadan next month. The publishers of Alaroye newspapers said eminent Yoruba leaders would attend the event. A statement by the Senior Manager, Administrative and Corporate Affairs, Alaroye newspapers, Mr. Gabriel Sosanya, said the centre would document art works, records, books and artifacts of Yoruba history. He said the centre would not only locate lost or forgotten historical materials, music and arts, but would also make them available for public use when the need arose.  “It will also digitise and reconstruct historical facts through documentaries and films on all aspects of Yoruba people, thereby making the work of researchers and others easy,” Sosanya added. He said that Alaroye, being the first Yoruba newspaper, took the step to further entrench Yoruba language and deepen its study at the centre. “We can confirm that there is one institution in the entire world where researchers or anyone at all can stay to conduct and complete works on the history, arts and culture of the Yoruba. “We strongly believe that there should be a centre to serve as a one-stop shop, offering old, new, recreated and reconstructed materials for researchers, lecturers, students, authors, journalists and members of the public interested in Yoruba history, arts and culture,” Sosanya said.
