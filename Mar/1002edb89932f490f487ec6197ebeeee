 Ooni of Ife Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi has urged Nigerians to explore potentials in herbal medicine to cure Coronavirus. The monarch, who addressed a news conference at his palace yesterday, contended that traditional herbal medicine has the potency to cure Coronavirus. He added that a divine proclamation came to the world on June 6, 2019, during the World Ifa Festival – Otura Meji – which foretold the impending rage of this invisible pandemic war. He said: “The cure to the pandemic Coronavirus lies in the ability to explore potentials of alternative natural medicine.  We should not condemn the alternative medical practitioner this time. I attest to its potency, it has been used to cure many chronic diseases. As spiritual head, this pandemic was foretold last June. It is to help humanity in Nigeria. “Cuba, which has strong traditional ties with Nigeria and the Kingdom of Ife in particular, has defeated the virus and helping countries because they value their cultural heritage which they got from us.” Ooni admonished Nigerians to learn from the worst-hit nations and keep their environment clean and maintain good hygiene to curb the spread of covid-19 and other diseases.
