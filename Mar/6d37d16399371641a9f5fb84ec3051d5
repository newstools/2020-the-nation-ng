 The management of Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company has warned its customers to avoid under high-tension wires. Its Chief Operating Officer, Mr. John Ayodele, appealed to the firm’s customers and the public to stop trading under high-tension wires, noting that the danger of doing so outweighs the profits of any business. Ayodele, who gave the advice in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, explained that due to weight of the wires and fire outbreaks, the wires could snap or sag, thereby causing electrical shocks that could lead to disabilities, life-threatening injuries or  death. He said the safest distance to the wires is 5.5 meters or 11 steps away.  Ayodele also advised the public to observe these safety rules to avoid electrocution or any electrical accident. He said: “Always stay clear of electrical installations, overhead wires, snapped/cut wires and pole. “Do not attempt to reconnect your residence to the electricity grid by yourself or using quarks.  Report any fallen poles, sagging wires to the nearest IBEDC office and always enlist the services of a NEMSA certified electrician for new house connections to the power grid.
