Imo Governor Hope Uzodinma has expressed shock over the recent passing of respected Imo elder statesman and politician of repute, Chief Innocent D. Nwoga. Chief Nwoga, former Minister of Establishment and Management Services in the Interim National Government led by Ernest Shonekan died last Wednesday at 86. Uzodinma regretted that Chief Nwoga, a pioneer chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Imo State as well as former chairman of Imo Elders Forum died when his fatherly counsel was most needed. “It is with shock that I have received the sad news of the death of one of Imo State’s respected elder statesman, Chief I.D. Nwoga. “With his passing, Imo has lost one of her best and renowned sons. His sterling leadership quality, uprightness and sense of accommodation and humour will be sorely missed by all,” the Governor said. He described late Nwoga as a devout Christian and great counselor to those who come in contact with him. “I, therefore, extend my sincere condolences to the entire Nwoga family, the people of Ahiazu Mbaise Local Government Area, Imo State and Nigerians in general for this great loss,” said the Governor. Governor Uzodinma prayed God to grant the soul of Chief Nwoga a peaceful repose and the family he has left behind, including the larger family of Imo State, the fortitude to bear the loss. The late Nwoga was an old boy of Stella Maris College, Port Harcourt, Rivers State. He once served as the President-General of Ezurueze Mbaise, an elite socio-cultural group of Mbaise prominent sons and daughters charged with the growth and development of Mbaise Nation in particular and Imo State in general. Chief Nwoga was appointed the chairman, Imo State Elders Advisory Council by the then Administration of former Governor Ikedi Ohakim. He led a life of service to humanity even at old age until he retired from active partisan politics in 2019.
