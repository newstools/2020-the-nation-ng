He said Patigi Constituency had 10 wards and 105 voting units, adding that INEC and security agencies would do all within their power to ensure a hitch-free election. Madami said: “Fifty-two thousand, two hundred and thirty-three (52, 233) people registered in the constituency. INEC received 51,471 permanent voter cards (PVCs), 43,685 PVCs were collected and 7,781 PVCs were not collected. “Eight parties conducted primaries and six forwarded the list of their successful candidates to us.
