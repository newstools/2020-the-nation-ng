 THE governors in the North-East met during the week to find solutions to the myriads of problems  facing the region. But how far can they go? Their host, Governor, Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya of Gombe State, minced no words on the challenges in the zone. Yahaya said in part: “The aim of this historic consultative meeting is to close ranks among our states and chart a way forward for the North-East sub-region; it will give us the chance to interface and dialogue on the ways to follow in order to attain our aspirations and objectives. “Over the last decade, the North-East sub-region has been in the news for various reasons. A devastating insurgency that kills thousands of people and displaces millions, debilitating climate change effects that endanger the livelihood of millions of people along the Chad basin and beyond, coupled with desertification with its attendant environmental damage has led to a systematic decline in the quality of life of our people, making the NE the most underdeveloped sub-region in the country. “As leaders, we have to take on these challenges with all sense of responsibility. More so because, the things that unite us are far more than the ones that divide us.” Nigerians await new ideas from the North-East because the peace of the zone will determine the fate of the country in the next few years.
