 Members of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Port Harcourt zone have said that there is no going back from the ongoing two-week warning strike called by the national union. The group comprising ASUU- UNIPORT, Niger Delta University(NDU), Ignatius Ajuru University if Education (IAUE), and  Federal University Otueke(FUO)  in Rivers and Bayelsa states stated this in a joint news briefing at the University of Port Harcourt(UNIPORT), Rivers State. The nationwide action which begun Monday, March 9, 2020, is reportedly meant to draw attention to the failure of the Federal Government  to fulfill its promise on the seven  point agenda of the union, which led to previous actions in the last three years.  The issues at stake according to the group include, the renegotiation of the 2009 FGN/ASUU agreement, outstanding since 2012, release of outstanding balances of the revitalization Fund for Universities, constitution of visitation panels to federal universities, earned academic allowances and committee for the interaction with visitors of state universities, on funding and proliferation of state universities. They regretted that they were deceived into suspending the six-month old action of late 2018 in February 2019 and vowed that there would be no going back should the federal government remain adamant during and after the warning strike.
