By Oluwamayomikun Orekoya  Nigerian striker Odion Ighalo scored a brilliant  first half goal to help Manchester United seal a 5-0 win in the Europa League at LASK Linz yesterday. Ighalo juggled the ball on both feet after receiving a pass from Bruno Fernandes before rocketing the ball into the top of the net to open the floodgates as the Red Devils visited the Austrian league runners-up in their round of 16 first leg clash. Further goals in the second half from Daniel James, Juan Mata, Mason Greenwood and Andreas Pereira gave the Reds a convincing win at the Raiffeisen Arena.  Ighalo, who was replaced in the 85th minute by Greenwood, has scored four goals in his first three starts since joining Manchester United on loan from From Chinese Super League side Shanghai Greenland Shenhua in January. Meanwhile, England legend and Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker believes the 30-year-old’s goal against LASK was nothing short of sensational, adding that the goal deserved to be seen by a much larger crowd. The match was played behind closed doors with only 500 people in attendance due to the coronavirus outbreak that has seen the cancellation of major sporting activities across the world. The former Leicester and Barcelona star tweeted during the game: “Just saw Ighalo’s goal. Sensational. Deserved a crowd.”
