MANCHESTER UNITED are reportedly firmly in the running to sign Barcelona winger Philippe Coutinho. The Brazil international has failed to make an impact at Camp Nou since his £142m transfer from Liverpool in 2018 and has spent this season on loan at German champions Bayern Munich. The 27-year-old has fared slightly better in the Bundesliga, registering eight goals and six assists in 22 league outings for Bayern during the 2019-20 campaign.  According to Mundo Deportivo, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side are in the hunt for a new creative player and have identified the former Liverpool attacker as a potential signing. The report also claims that any funds raised from a potential sale could be used in Barca’s pursuit of Neymar and Lautaro Martinez, after Coutinho was supposedly given the green light for a return to the Premier League. Coutinho has registered 21 goals in 76 games across all competitions for Barcelona and will see his current contract with Quique Setien’s side expire in 2023.
