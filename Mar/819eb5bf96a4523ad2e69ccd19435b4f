ARSENAL manager Mikel Arteta has applauded the Premier League for postponing all fixtures until April and revealed he is “feeling better already” after contracting coronavirus. It was revealed on Thursday night that Arteta had tested positive for coronavirus after feeling unwell on Wednesday. Arteta, Arsenal’s first-team squad and several other members of club staff have now gone into quarantine for 14 days. The Premier League responded to Arteta’s diagnosis on Friday morning by postponing all fixtures until at least April 3.  It comes after several other Premier League clubs were impacted by coronavirus, including Everton and West Ham United. Arteta has subsequently applauded the Premier League’s decision to suspend games and confirmed he is on the mend. “Thanks for your words and support. Feeling better already,” tweeted Arteta. “We’re all facing a huge & unprecedented challenge. Everyone’s health is all that matters right now. “Protect each other by following the guidelines & we’ll come through this together. Well done PL for making the right decisions.”
