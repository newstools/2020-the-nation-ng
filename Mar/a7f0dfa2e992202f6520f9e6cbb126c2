The Chairman, Air Transport Services Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (ATSSSAN), FAAN Branch, Comrade Ahmed Danjuma, has projected an income of about N100 million by March ending, as proceeds from the collection of tolls at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport (MMIA) access road. Comrade Danjuma, who gave the projection yesterday in a chat with newsmen stated that FAAN has been able to garner N80 million from toll fees collections, adding that by march ending, FAAN will be able to know precisely how long they can stay. “I assure you that we would be able to hit N100 million”, Danjuma said, noting that “Within the first month of operation, we generated over N80 million despite the teething problems.” Danjuma also informed that in a recent meeting with FAAN MD, Capt. Rabiu Yadudu, and others, the union had raised the need to establish a free trade zone around the airport environment. He stated that the idea was brought to Capt Yadudu based on the information they got on how the establishment of the free trade zone would benefit the people. He, however, pointed out that the concern of the union was that the free trade zone will give room to business owners within the confine of that zone to operate without paying taxes. Recall that one month ago, the union took over the collection of tolls at the MMIA. Emphasizing that  FAAN went after the facility because they believed that they can do it better, Danjuma this was even the main reason the union went there and did creditably well. On the issue of indebtedness to FAAN by operators, Danjuma said the union has written to some of the debtors requesting them to offset their bills within the shortest possible time.
