A record 100,000 Youths are to benefit from the training partnership between Youth and Sports Development Ministry and the Nigeria Content Development and Monitoring Board. According to the Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Mr. Sunday Dare, He said embargo would be laid on trainings that do not yield positive results, even as he insisted that emphasises would be placed on trainings that  will lead to direct employment opportunities for the Youth. Speaking while receiving in his office the Executive Secretary of the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), Engr. Simbi Wabote, the Minister explained that the era of training Youth in fields that are neither  profitable nor relevant to their lives was over. He lamented that the failures of many vocational centres scattered across the country was because they were not designed to be sustainable.  Dare said he is seeking partnership with the NCDMB on ongoing training initiatives which include mobile device repairs, poultry production, electrical technicians among others. “What I like about these programmes is you can see the end-to-end value in them.  You can see where the jobs and opportunities are at the end of these trainings and they are both practical and useful. We also believe these trainings can be scaled up to between 50,000 – 100,000 Youth”. “You can see very clearly where these programmes plug in to our DEEL plan. Hence, we are happy to partner with organisations like NCDMB that have both the mandate and the resources to do what is needed.” In his response ,Engineer Wabote said”Collaborations like this will lead to national development and empowerment of the Youths. We have a responsibility to build a better future for our youths”.
