Anambra State Government has approved a special academic calendar for school children in flood-prone areas of the state. A statement signed by Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Basic Education, Mr. Linus Nwankwo said the approval was granted at a recent Executive Council meeting based on request by the Commissioner of the ministry, Prof. Kate Omenugha. It noted that the adjustment became necessary as children from such disadvantaged areas were usually out of school when floodwaters ravaged their schools. According to the release, “The first term in the 2020/2021 academic session would normally end on July 24. “A short break would be observed until, Aug. 2, while the first term would begin on Aug.3 and end on Sept. 4. “A holiday would run from September to Oct. 30. Classes would resume again on Nov. 2 and terminate on Dec. 18. “Christmas vacation involving other areas would begin on Dec. 18 to end on Jan. 4, 2021.” The statement enjoined Chairmen, State Post Primary Schools Services Commission and Universal Basic Education Board to take note of the approved changes. “Zonal Directors, Zone and Area Education Officers, Education Secretaries and all concerned stakeholders in Education zones and Local Government Areas should also take note of the changes,” the statement added.
