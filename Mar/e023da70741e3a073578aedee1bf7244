A Haematologist with National Hospital, Abuja, Dr Yashim Andrew, on Sunday warned against use of herbal medicine for the treatment of hepatitis, HIV/AIDS and other blood related diseases. Andrew, a fellow of the West African Post Graduate College of Lab Scientists and a Consultant medical laboratory scientists, gave the warning in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja. According to him, patients suffering from hepatitis, HIV/AIDS are more at risk if they engage in self-medication with herbs and other unprescribed drugs to treat themselves without proper consultation, diagnosis and prescription from a qualified medical doctor. He therefore stressed the need for the patients to seek medical care at the hospitals or healthcare facilities for proper management and treatment. “Those living with hepatits, HIV/AIDs should not stay at home, they should come to the hospital for proper follow-up and management. “They should desist from seeking local treatment or consumption of herbs, which has not yet been proven for treatment of hepatitis, which could be of higher molecular substance which the liver cannot conjugate and instead of the liver working on it to be assimilated by the body, it will now destroy the liver cells,” the expert cautioned. He explained further that it may develop to chronic or long-term disease, which would be more difficult to manage, thereby leading to liver failure, liver cancer, diseases or even death. “All these infectious diseases are blood related and because it is blood that takes every substance round the body. “Once the blood which is suppose to defend the body is now attacked, the immune system of the body will go down and give opportunity for other organisms to come in to attack the body.” Andrew, therefore, advised the public to always seek medical care for any ailment, rather than resort to self medication or treatment from unqualified persons.
