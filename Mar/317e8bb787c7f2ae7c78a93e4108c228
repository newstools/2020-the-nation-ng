Founder and Spiritual Director of Adoration Ministry Enugu, Rev. Fr. Ejike Mbaka, said he spends over $2 million monthly on his philanthropic activities. He spoke shortly after presenting N18.8 million to the management of Annunciation Specialist Hospital, Emene, Enugu, on behalf of Multi-Life Savers for the Less Privileged, a non-governmental arm of his ministry. He gave out N10 million to 200 select members of the Charismatic Renewal of Nigeria for empowerment coupled with a bag of rice each. According to Mbaka, the N18.8 million was to cover accumulated free medical services that the hospital had rendered to indigent people on his bill, amounting to over N14 million. He stated the balance covers a deposit for other indigent patients that would require the services of the Catholic health facility in future. According to him, the hospital is one of several health facilities where his foundation usually referred indigent patients to receive free qualitative medical care, to save them from dying unduly. He said: “We are basically here to continue the relationship that this wonderful health facility has with our charity organisation and Adoration Ministry, Enugu. “We presented a bank draft worth N18.8 million to them to cover the accumulated bills of indigent patients they had treated at our instance, plus a deposit for other indigent patients that would come here in future. “We do this every day and it is on record that there is no month that I don’t spend at least $2 million silently, on charity. “So, this visit is just one out of several charity outings that we undertake without any publicity. “I represent the ministry here, as the chief servant. What we are doing is physical but I am also here, on behalf of the supernatural part of the exercise. “This programme is purely inter-religious, inter-tribal and interdenominational. Among the beneficiaries are Catholics, Pentecostals, and Muslims, among others.”
