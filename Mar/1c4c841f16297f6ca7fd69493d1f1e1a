 The Nigerian Institute of Building (NIOB) is set to hold the maiden edition of the Builders’ Day on March 13. March 13 yearly was set aside as ‘Builders’ Day’ to remember the five-storey building that collapsed at No 63, Massey Street on the Lagos Island on March 13, 2019, and killed over 20 people, mostly school children. NIOB National President, Kunle Awobodu, said the sad incident caused by substandard building construction, which has become a common practice in Nigeria, should be a reminder to stakeholders in the building industry on the fatal implications of non-compliance with appropriate building construction process. He said the Builders’ Day, which would be a yearly event, would be a nation-wide sensitisation campaign against substandard building construction. Awobodu called for the support of relevant Federal and state government ministries, departments and agencies, as well as critical industry stakeholders to realise the objectives set for the day. He said the NIOB was ready to collaborate with well-meaning institutions and building professional groups in the training of artisans and standardisation of  materials.
