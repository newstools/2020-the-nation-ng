Kwara State Commissioner for Education and Human Capital Development Hajia Fatimah Ahmed has registered with the Teachers’ Registration Council of Nigeria (TRCN). State Coordinator of TRCN Otun Olajide, who presented Ahmed her certificate, praised the Governor AbdulRaman AbdulRazak-led administration for appointing a professional teacher as education commissioner. “This is putting a round peg in a round hole,” he said. Olajide said the organisation decided to start enforcing activities in the ministry by presenting a TRCN certificate to Ahmed. He added that the action is a warning to unregistered teachers to take action. He called on potential teachers to come forward for professional registration to avoid embarrassment when the team visits schools in the state. Hajia Ahmed hailed TRCN’s initiative on the enforcement of professional registration of teachers. “Before my appointment as commissioner, my father advised me to register for the teacher’s professional examination and I concurred. I wrote the exams last year and to God be the glory, I am now a certified teacher,” she said. The commissioner encouraged teachers to register for the professional examination to become relevant in the system.
