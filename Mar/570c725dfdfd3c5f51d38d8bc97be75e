 THE Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Adeniyi Adebayo, has said there is the need to review the Act establishing oil and gas free zones in Nigeria. The Minister, who stated this at a stakeholders’ forum organised by the ministry to examine the Oil and Gas Free Zone Authority (OGFZA) in Abuja, noted that the review was to remove ambiguities and enhance effectiveness in the sector. Adeniyi maintained that the Act required serious review to remove ambiguities and inconsistencies for clarity and enhancement of effectiveness thereby necessitating the review of the OGFZA Act. The Minister said over the years, the inadequacy of the Act has led to avoidable inter-agency conflicts, which hampered OGFZA and the execution of its mandate, hence the decision to create a platform to engage stakeholders for best possible outcome. Nigeria is the pioneer of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) with  the establishment of the first oil and gas free zone Act No 8 of March 29, 1996 in Onne, Rivers State,  which was supervised at the time by the then Ministry of Commerce.
