 TWO students have been sent to jail for stealing four bags of cement valued at N6,200. A Kaduna Magistrates court gave the convicts no option of fine. The students, Emmanuel Moses, 25, and Amos Yerima, 27, admitted committing the offence. The Magistrate, Umar Ibrahim, said the punishment would serve as a deterrent to would-be offenders. Prosecutor, Inspector Chidi Leo told the court that one Adamu George reported the case on February 28 at the Karji police station. Leo said that the convicts conspired and stole four bags of cement from a building site belonging to the complainant at Karji. The prosecutor said the convicts were arrested when they attempted to sell the cement. He said the offences contravened the Sections 59 and 287 of the Penal Code Law of Kaduna State.
