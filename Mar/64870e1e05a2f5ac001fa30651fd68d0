The Green Chamber has resolved to set up an ad-hoc Committee to investigate the non-inclusion of waste management/disposal and sludge disposal in numerous projects by the various International Oil companies (IOCs) operating within the shores of Nigeria The resolution was with a spin-off of motion on the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas, Train 7 which a lawmaker, Rep Yusuf Adamu Gagdi, complained was flawed in its construction. Gagdi, while moving the motion, said: “The House notes that sometime last year, the Final Investment Decision (FID) for the NLNG Train 7 project was signed. “That the estimated cost of the project was $10,000,000,000 (Ten billion dollars). “That the project is currently at the stage of sign-off by NLNG to SIAPEM, CHYODA AND DAEWOO (SCD), as a Consortium.” However, the lawmaker expressed concern that the Environmental Impact Assessment did not cut across the two host communities of Finima and Bonny. “The EIA only covers NLNG industrial Area and Residential Area, EPC’s residential camp and Project Site,” he said.
