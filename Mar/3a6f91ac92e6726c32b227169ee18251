More than two-thirds of total stakes on the Nigerian equities market were invested in three of Nigeria’s largest banks as investors sought bargains and long-term value creation amid steep price depreciation occasioned by continuing global spread of Coronavirus. Nigeria’s two largest financial institutions- Guaranty Trust Bank (GTBank) Plc and Zenith Bank International Plc and United Bank for Africa (UBA), the fifth largest bank by market capitalisation, were the major bargain deals for investors during the immediate past week. The three banking stocks accounted for 2.45 billion shares worth N29.56 billion in 12,301 deals, representing 61.8 per cent, 67.6 per cent and 52.4 per cent of the total equity turnover volume, value and number of deals recorded respectively at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE). The global scare caused by the outbreak and continuing spread of Covid-19 and the resultant crude oil price crash fuelled major crash in share prices across the world. Nigerian equities suffered their worst decline in a decade during the immediate past week. Share prices of most Nigerian equities crashed to their lowest in more than a year, creating a mix of bargain-hunting and selloffs as investors weighed immediate risks of continuing price depreciation and potential long-term value in fundamentally strong stocks. The frenzied selloffs and intense bargain-hunting doubled turnover at the NSE by 118.5 per cent. Total turnover at the NSE stood at 3.96 billion shares worth N43.70 billion in 26,054 deals last week compared with a total of 1.81 billion shares valued at N26.01 billion traded in 23,494 deals two weeks ago. The financial services sector, the traditional most active sector, accounted for 3.55 billion shares valued at N33.62 billion in 19,150 deals, representing 89.48 per cent and 76.94 per cent of the total equity turnover volume and value respectively. The consumer goods sector occupied a distant second position on the activities chart with a turnover of 91.14 million shares worth N6.01 billion in 2,341 deals. The conglomerates sector placed third with a turnover of 88.41 million shares worth N132.51 million in 679 deals. Also traded during the week were a total of 75,285 units of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) valued at N472.9 million in six deals compared with a total of 8,193 units valued at N68,491 traded in 11 deals penultimate week. In the sovereign bond market, a total of 62,290 units of Federal Government bonds valued at N71.46 million were traded in 18 deals compared with a total of 61,750 units valued at N70 million in 27 deals. The increase in momentum of activities came amid steep decline in share prices as investors scurried to readjust their portfolios in the wake of increasing global and national macroeconomic uncertainties due to the spread of Covid-19. The All Share Index (ASI), the value-based common index that tracks share prices at the NSE, declined by 13.49 per cent from its week’s opening index of 26,279.61 points to close weekend at 22,733.35 points. Aggregate market value of all quoted equities at the NSE dropped from the week’s opening value of N13.695 trillion to close weekend at N11.847 trillion, representing a drop of N1.85 trillion. This depressed the average year-to-date return to -15.31 per cent. The market was in red in nearly all trading sessions, closing weekend with only two gainers for the week against 64 losers. In the previous week, there were 36 gainers against 25 losers. Expectedly, all sectoral indices also closed negative with above-average decline in the influential banking subsector.
