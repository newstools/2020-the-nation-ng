The Court of Appeal sitting in Benin City has upheld the death sentence of Mrs. Enobong Isonguyo, who connived with her lover, Pastor Prince Udoka Ukachukwu, to kill her husband. The woman, along with her lover was sentenced to death by an Edo State High Court sitting in Benin City, for conniving and conspiring to kill Mr. Victor Gabriel Isunguyo. Dissatisfied with the judgment of the trial court, Mrs. Enobong Isonguyo, appealed to the Court of Appeal seeking to have her conviction and sentence set aside and a verdict of acquittal entered in her favour. At the hearing of the appeal, counsel to the appellant, Olayiwola Afolabi Esq., argued that the offence of murder was not successfully proved at the lower court and urged the appellate court to quash the conviction. But on his part, counsel to the respondent (The State) led by the Solicitor-General and Permanent Secretary, Edo State Ministry of Justice, Oluwole O. Iyamu (SAN) argued that all the elements of murder were copiously established by the direct evidence of the appellant as well as evidence of the IPO, other Police Officers and other witnesses who testified for the state. Iyamu further urged the court to dismiss the appeal and uphold the judgment of the lower court. In its reserved judgment delivered on 26th March, 2020, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal in its entirety and upheld the conviction of the appellant by the lower court
