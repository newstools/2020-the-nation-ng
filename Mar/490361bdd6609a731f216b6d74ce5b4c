BRIGHTON boss Graham Potter intends to take it one match at a time as the Seagulls prepare for a daunting run of fixtures which could decide their Premier League fate. Last Saturday’s 1-0 home defeat by rivals Crystal Palace left Brighton still looking for a first win of 2020 and lying just a point above the relegation zone. To make matters worse, most of the teams below them picked up points last weekend, and Brighton must now try and respond with some positive results of their own or risk dropping into the bottom three. That is unlikely to be easy, however, with this weekend’s trip to sixth-placed Wolves being followed by successive matches against Arsenal, Manchester United, Norwich, Liverpool and Manchester City.
