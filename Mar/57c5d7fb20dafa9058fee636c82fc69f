The Lagos State Government has appreciated individuals and organisations that had supported victims of the Abule-Ado-Soba explosion and solicited further support to rebuild the community. The Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr Gbenga Omotoso said in a statement on Wednesday that no fewer than 20 people died and property worth billions of naira destroyed in the March 15 disaster. Omotoso said the support was necessary because the financial resources required to restore Abule-Ado-Soba were enormous. “The Abule-Ado Emergency Relief Fund accounts are domiciled in three banks: Polaris Bank – 4030017510; Zenith Bank – 1017184516; and Guaranty Trust Bank – 0568615688,” he said. According to him, Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu set up a N2 billion Emergency Relief Fund to provide relief for the victims of the incident and released N250 million toward the cause. ”State governments and corporate organisations have donated to the relief fund. Dangote Group and Zenith Bank have contributed N100 million each to the fund. ”The fact-finding Committee constituted by the governor to determine the cause of the explosion and proffer recommendations to prevent a re-occurrence will soon complete its assignment,” he said.
