South Korea sought murder charges against leaders of a secretive church at the heart of its ballooning coronavirus outbreak on Monday as the global death toll rose above 3,000 and the Chinese province at the epicentre reported a fall in new cases. World stock markets regained some calm as hopes for global interest rate cuts to soften the economic blow of the virus steadied nerves after last week’s worst plunge since the 2008 financial crisis. The global death toll was up to 3,044, according to a Reuters tally.  In the largest outbreak outside China, South Korea has had 26 deaths and reported another 599 infections yesterday, taking its tally to 4,335 following Saturday’s biggest daily jump. Of the new cases in South Korea, 377 were from the city of Daegu, home to a branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, to which most of South Korea’s cases have been traced after some members visited China’s Wuhan city, where the disease emerged. The Seoul government asked prosecutors to launch a murder investigation into leaders of the church, a movement that reveres founder Lee Man-hee. Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon said if Lee and other heads of the church had cooperated, preventive measures could have stopped fatalities. Lee knelt and apologised to the country yesteray that one church member had infected many others, calling the epidemic a “great calamity”. “We did our best but were not able to stop the spread of the virus,” Lee told reporters.
