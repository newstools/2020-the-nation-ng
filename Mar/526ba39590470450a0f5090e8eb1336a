 LAGOS State Government on Thursday warned that it would no longer condone acts of brigandage from workers in its tertiary institutions in the quest for realising their demands from the government. It urged the staff unions to leverage more on constructive negotiations, saying the era of using violence  is over. Special Adviser on Education Mr Tokunbo Wahab was reacting to the friction between the leadership of the unions of Adeniran Ogunsanya College of Education (AOCOED), Otto/Ijanikin leading to the locking up of the offices of Registrar and Bursar, Messrs. Shehu Muhideen and Adeyanju Adebisi. On Monday, the unions comprising College of Education Academic Staff Union (COEASU); Non Academic Staff unions (NASU); Senior Staff Unions of College of Education in Nigeria (SSUCOEN); and National Academic Staff Technologists of Colleges of Education (NACEATYON) accused  Shehu and Adeyanju of financial misappropriation. The unions locked the duo’s offices, deflated their car tyres and demanded they leave the premises immediately to allow proper investigation to commence. However, the registrar has since denied the claims. Mr Wahab, who last night mobilised police from Ijanikin Police Station to unlock the duo’s offices, lamented that the unions have overstepped their bonds.
