 PRESIDENT of the National Association of Social Workers (NASoW), Mashood Mustapha has urged the government to expedite action on passing the social work bill which he noted was already at the National Assembly and awaiting assent. He spoke at a press briefing organised by NASoW Lagos State chapter to celebrate this year’s International Social Work Day themed: “Promoting the importance of human relationships.” “The Council Bill is on course. Recall when we came on board in November 2018, we unveiled our 3-point agenda with the actualisation of the bill our highest priority. The bill is very important and we want the government to give it a priority, though it is back to the National Assembly and undergoing the due process,” he said.
