 E-Tranzact International Plc plans to raise N7 billion in new equity funds from existing shareholders. The company has applied to the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) for regulatory approval to proceed with the new capital raising. E-Tranzact will be offering 4.67 billion ordinary shares of 50 kobo each to existing shareholders at a price of N1.50 per share. The rights issue will be pre-allotted on a basis of 10 new ordinary shares of 50 kobo each for every nine ordinary shares of 50 kobo each held as at the close of business on March 25, 2020. Shareholders of E-Tranzact had in December 2018 authorised the board of the company to raise additional capital of up to N7 billion “through the issuance of any form of equity instrument(s), whether by way of public offering, private placement, rights issue, offer for subscription or other methods they deem fit, with or without preferential allotments, either locally or internationally, at such dates and on such terms and conditions as shall be determined by the directors”. Shareholders also empowered the directors to consider as an alternative or addition issuance of convertible or non-convertible loans while allowing the company to issue undersubscribed shares to interested investors as well as absorb excess subscriptions. Shareholders increased the company’s authorised share capital from N2.1 billion or 4.2 billion ordinary shares of 50 kobo each to N9.1 billion or 18.2 billion ordinary shares of 50 kobo each.
