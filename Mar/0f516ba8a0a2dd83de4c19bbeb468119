Heavyweight boxing legend Mike Tyson has revealed he knocked out a bin man after he threw his pet pigeon in the bin. Tyson achieved 50 victories and 44 knockouts from his 58 career fights during a 20-year career. But the most memorable punch of the 53-year-old’s life was landed after losing his pet pigeon Julius. Tyson wanted time to grieve and hold a memorial for the pigeon, but was robbed of the opportunity to do so when a bin man disposed of his pet upon seeing him lifeless on a crate. Tyson told World Boxing Council: ‘One morning I woke up and found my favourite pigeon, Julius, had died. I was devastated and was gonna use his crate as my stickball bat to honour him. ‘I left the crate on my stoop and went in to get something and I returned to see the sanitation man put the crate into the crusher. ‘I rushed him and caught him flush on the temple with a titanic right hand and he was out cold.’
