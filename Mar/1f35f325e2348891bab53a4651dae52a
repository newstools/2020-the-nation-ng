By Agency Reporter Visionary comedian, I Go Dye has launched Coronavirus campaign to help the Federal Government promote more awareness on social distancing. As the Covid-19 plague continues to wreak havoc globally, the Global Goals Ambassador, Francis Agoda has urged Nigerians to take precautionary measures to curb the disease. The widely travelled comedian who cancelled his 25th-anniversary show tagged; “I Go Dye Standing, Kinging with the Kings” which was scheduled to hold on April 12, gave the advice in a one-minute video posted on his verified handle. The visionary comedian noted that apart from personal hygiene like regular handwashing with soap and the need to sanitize as well as use of masks, social distancing should be maintained. In the video, the multiple award-winning comedian advised Nigerians to adhere to the “stay at home” order by the Federal Government as this will help curb the Covid-19 spread. “We have a role to play at this point of our life, let’s try and save humanity. I call on those that were at the AMVCAs to go for check-up since the governor of Lagos State has declared they may be at risk. And those who attended the show who are in Asaba should go for screening. So that they can protect their lives, which is more important and reduce further damage to others,” he said. He also kicked against handshakes or hugs, no matter how familiar one is with the person or persons in question. I Go Dye further urged the Federal Government to be more proactive in every way possible to safeguard the lives of Nigerians.
