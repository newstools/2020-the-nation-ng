Tyson Fury and his team have been accused of bribing a farmer in an attempt to cover up drugs cheating dating back to 2015. The claim centers around failed drugs test for both Tyson and his cousin Hughie five years ago. At the time the Fury’s blamed the positive tests on uncastrated wild boar meat or contaminated supplements. Ultimately Tyson Fury accepted a back-dated two-year ban before being allowed to resume his boxing career in 2017. Despite the matter being done and dusted Lancashire farmer, Martin Carefoot has decided to bring forward fresh allegations whilst Fury is coming off the biggest win of his career over Deontay Wilder. He claims he was offered £25,000 to lie about supplying the Fury family with wild boar meat, although he was never paid. Mr Carefoot also claims he signed two witness statements confirming he had supplied the team with wild boar meat, which have now been forwarded to UK Anti-Doping (UKAD). A statement from UKAD to The Mail on Sunday read: “We will always review any potential evidence in relation to any anti-doping offence and take investigatory action where necessary. If anyone has information that could be of interest to UKAD and its investigations on any matter, we urge them to contact us.”
