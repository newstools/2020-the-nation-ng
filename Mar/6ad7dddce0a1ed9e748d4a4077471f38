Yoruba movie star, Mistura Asunramu aka Fali Olomi has claimed that piracy has taken over YouTube. The U.S based actress expressed that the online streaming platform is currently being besieged by individuals who are acting like pirates. Asunramu called on her colleagues to support the campaign against Youtube piracy. The actress/producer made it known that old movies on the online streaming platform are being promoted with new movie covers. She wrote, “My take on YouTube Piracy. I have noticed that our movies no longer have values on Youtube because of some bad stations. We are not done with DVD piracy which has disorganized the industry yet you bring it on the only platform we depend on for now. whereby you put old movies which you never paid for and use a new pix we post on IG and even use the titles of the trending movies then also put an old film as part 2 for a trending movie.” Using her new movie as a sample, “My recent movie WICKED SOUL is on Apata tv, but any mistake of pressing the title you will see like 4films with the same title and picture of the same cast. This is not encouraging because even YouTube tend to be giving advert to all d bad movies because they have about 200stations both for Yoruba and English Movies,” she explained. “Please let’s keep flagging them if we can or repost if you are affected. This must stop. The Bad stations I have noticed so far #Yorubamovies, #yorubamovies247 #yorubacinema, #Yorubastyles #Tiwantiwa #yorubabesttv, #Newyorubamovies2018 #Let Nollywood artistes eat the fruit of their labour.” “We spend our hard-earned money to produce our movies and we do a lot of promos to keep our titles #Stop diminishing us #Stop misrepresenting us. let’s live our life.” Her recent work ‘Fali Olomi in Yankee’ was released via online platform OK on TV on March 20 and it features top actors such as Muyiwa Ademola, Seyi Edun, Abeni Balogun, Adeniyi Johnson, among others.
