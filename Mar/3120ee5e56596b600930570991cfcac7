Our Reporter  The National Institute of Marketing of Nigeria (NIMN) has announced plans to prosecute six individuals, including marketing chieftains of conglomerates for flouting marketing practice rule. The institute, in an affidavit sworn to by its Registrar, Mr. Sydney Ogodo, at the Federal High Court of Nigeria, Ikoyi, Lagos, accused the individuals of practising the profession without proper certification from the institute. Ogodo, in the affidavit, explained that the institute, established by an Act of the National Assembly of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, in 2003, to register any person who practises marketing in the country, decided to tow the judicial path, after several overtures from it were rebuffed by the concerned individuals. He further stated that before resorting to prosecuting the individuals, the institute had, in 2018, made publications in the national dailies, asking individuals practising the profession without any valid registration with the institute, to begin the process of registration. According to him, while many responded, and had since been members of the institute, the six individuals did not heed the Registration call, even after the institute’s council decided to engage them, personally, in 2019. The institute, he further explained, therefore sought among other reliefs, an Order of Perpetual Injunction, ‘restraining the individuals, whether by themselves, their assigns, servants, agents, officers, privies or whatsoever from practising or earning fees as marketers in Nigeria, until they have registered with the claimant.’
