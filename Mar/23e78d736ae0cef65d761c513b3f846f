 BENEUE State Governor Samuel Ortom has apologised to pensioners over the government’s inability to pay pension and gratuities arrears. Ortom, who spoke in Makurdi, also apologised on behalf of previous administrations, over the unpaid arrears. He said the state would soon start the Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS) that would ensure that serving and retired workers received their pension entitlement promptly.  He said: “I apologise, on behalf of our government, as well as previous administrations in the state, to our workers, both serving and retired, for the inability to find a lasting solution to the pension problem before now. “One of the most unpleasant realities we met when I assumed duty as governor of Benue was the huge pension liabilities inherited from previous administrations. “Indeed, the pension problem was competing for attention with the humanitarian crisis arising from the perennial herders’ attacks as well as other challenges of development and governance.”
