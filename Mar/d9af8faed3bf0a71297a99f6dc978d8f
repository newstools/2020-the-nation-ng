 MIKEL Arteta believes Arsenal have to rally around “gutted” Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang as he seeks to put his late miss in Thursday’s Europa League exit behind him. The 30-year-old was unable to convert a glorious late chance, allowing Olympiacos to dump the Gunners out at the last 32 stage. Aubameyang is the Premier League’s joint topscorer with 17 goals and had earlier looked to have salvaged a disappointing performance against the Greek Super League leaders with an acrobatic back-post volley, before Youssef El Arabi’s 119th-minute strike. Aubameyang was visibly distraught afterwards, admitting “I don’t know how I missed” and Arteta urged his team-mates to support the striker as they prepare for Monday’s FA Cup fifth round trip to Portsmouth. “He was gutted,” said Arteta. “Obviously he scored a wonder goal that was putting us through in the competition, and with the last kick of the game, he had the best chance of the game. “He felt very responsible about it, we will try to be right behind him. He has been phenomenal all season for us and now the players have to support him, I think his reaction after the game – to face the media and the way he talked, it was a very mature reaction from him. “It is part of the profession. We can fall and have disappointments, it is about how we react individually and collectively. Then my job is to try to convince them that in the process in which we are at the moment, there are a lot of positive things and as well things we have to improve if we want to much better as a team. So, that is the way.”
