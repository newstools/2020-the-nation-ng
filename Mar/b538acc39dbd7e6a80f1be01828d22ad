Singer and songwriter, Angelique Kidjo, has made the Forbes list of Africa’s Most Powerful Women. The Grammy-award singer shared the cover of the Forbes magazine, to show her new achievement over the weekend. Kidjo recently made headlines when she beat Nigeria’s Burna Boy and other artists around the world to nab her fourth Grammy award. Kidjo, who has 13 albums to her name, scooped her fourth Grammy Award for ‘Best World Music Album’ for her recent release ‘Celia’ in January 2020. Kidjo attended the G7 summit and alongside the French president, Emmanuel Macron and the African Development Bank President, Akinwumi Adesina, announced a $251 million pledge by the G7 to provide access to loans to African female entrepreneurs through the Affirmative Finance Action for Women in Africa initiative. “I have received so much from my continent when I was a little girl, so much culture and heritage that allows me to create powerful art. I want to give back to this continent for giving me this richness that people outside Africa don’t know,” says Kidjo to Forbes Africa.
