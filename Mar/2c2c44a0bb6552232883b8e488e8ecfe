 NIGERIAâ€™s hope of saving $422.9 million yearly from wheat importation following increasing production to about two million metric tonnes could be threaten if insecurity continues to prevent farmers from assessing farmland in Borno State and key production states. Nigeria imports 4.4 million tonnes of wheat. After several interventions from both the government and the private sector, production is said to have increased from 200,000 to about 900,000 metric tonnes. The Flour Milling Association of Nigeria (FMAN) has supported farmers with two major high-yielding wheat varieties, including Norman and Atilla and other inputs. Speaking with The Nation, a leading agronomist with FMAN, Alhaji Ahmed Abdullahi, said insecurity has continued to restrict access to farmland, thereby, threatening total production that should come from all the farming areas. He noted though farmers were working, insecurity had driven them from traditional producing states such as Borno State. He noted that while efforts were being made to support farmers with high yields, capable of producing five tonnes per hectare, these would not yield impact if the security situation did not improve to allow increased cultivation. With expanded production in the 13 states identified for wheat production nationwide, Abddullahi said importation could drop massively in the next five years.
