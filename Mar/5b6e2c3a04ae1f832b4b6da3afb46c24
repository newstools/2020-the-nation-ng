Skill acquisition is a vital tool for fighting poverty, an expert has said. Prince Adebowale Aderonke, who is the President-elect, Rotary Club of Onigbongbo, noted that people should be able to identify one with a skill that will make one useful to the society. He spoke at a skill acquisition in soap making for 50 Lagosians courtesy of Rotary Club of Onigbongbo and Gbenyi Foundation at the Onigbongbo Community Hall, Lagos. The club’s President, James Ajayi, said Rotary is for service. That is why the club goes out to support the efforts of the government and individuals. ‘’We don’t collect money from people nor do we do so for political gains. And we don’t do so because we live in this community. Some of us do not,’’ he added. He also said one way of assisting the public is to teach them how to make soap to avert coronavirus, among other diseases. He told the beneficiaries that soap making skill might look small, but that as an empowerment strategy, it has long-term rewards, urging them to take it serious. ‘’It’s an opportunity. Education is power. No knowledge gained is lost,’’ he said. Onigbongbo Community Development Committee (CDC) representative Opeyemi Sadiq advised the youth to take the training serious. He noted that he was trained in many areas and that these are helping her to survive.
