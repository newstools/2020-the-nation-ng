 THE Executive Secretary, Nigeria Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), Simbi Wabote, has called for collaboration with the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) to improve the operations in the oil and gas industry. Wabote stated this when he visited the NPF Headquarters in Abuja yesterday. The NCDMB chief stated that the visit was necessitated by the need to foster collaboration between the Police and the Board in safeguarding lives and infrastructure within its operational areas. He said: “The Police Commissioner in Bayelsa State has provided tremendous support in terms of security in the past, and we are here to ask for more security support for staff and critical infrastructure.” The Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Abubakar Adamu, expressed appreciation to the Board for the visit and commended the ES for the great achievements made so far by the Board and assured the NCDMB of the Nigeria Police security support to enable it maximally perform its core mandate. Adamu assured that the NPF would do everything possible to synergise and improve the Board’s performance in line with its obligation to provide adequate security in the entire country and urged the Board to effectively collaborate with the police command in Bayelsa State in the area of corporate social responsibility and other stakeholder engagements.
