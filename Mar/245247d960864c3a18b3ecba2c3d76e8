 LIVING in Bondage: Breaking Free’ star, JideKene Achufusi and Nancy Isime are gradually becoming one cool onscreen couple. Jidekene and Nancy’s first onscreen-dating occurred during the filming of Ramsey Nouah’s directorial debut, ‘Living in Bondage: Breaking Free’. Jidekene, who plays the lead character in the remake of the 1992 Nollywood classic, had a brief fling with Nancy in the film. The two looked good together but had their relationship cut short after the emergence of Munachi Abii. Almost a year after filming together for ‘Living in Bondage: Breaking Free’, Jidekene and Nancy have been spotted again as an onscreen couple for another film. The onscreen couple reunited as an onscreen couple on the set of ‘Kambili- The whole 30 yards.’ The film is directed by Kayode Kasum for Filmone productions and is scheduled to debut in the cinemas on June 12, 2020.
