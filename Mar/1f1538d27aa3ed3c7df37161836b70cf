 LAGOS State Government on Sunday urged residents to pay attention to the importance of proper usage of freshwater to ensure availability and sustainable management of freshwater for all in the nearest future. According to a press statement signed by the Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Tunji Bello, the World Water Day is celebrated across the world yearly in order to increase the awareness among people about the importance, need and conservation of water with the focus on universal access to Clean Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) in line with the targets of SDG 6 by 2030. Bello noted that the theme for this year’s celebration being “Water & Climate Change” is apt at this time as climate change affects the water cycle change significantly  because when climate is warm, more water evaporates from the surface of the earth and in turn a warmer atmosphere can hold more water. He explained that due to various factors such as population growth, industrialisation and climate change, water resources across the world are under great pressure not only in terms of quantity but in terms of quality.
