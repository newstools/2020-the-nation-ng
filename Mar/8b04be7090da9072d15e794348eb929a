 FBNInsurance Limited has continued to provide financial security to Nigerians as it paid N9.92 billion claims last year, the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of the company, Mr. Val Ojuma,  has said. This is higher than the N4.31 billion paid by the company in 2018. According to him, prompt settlement of customer’s claims is key to the success of their business, noting that this has also continually boosted customers’ confidence and trust in the company. He said: “As a responsive and reliable insurer that keeps its promises, we promptly paid claims to our clients to the tune of N9.92b which is a 130 per cent increase from N4.31 billion paid in 2018. “Our strategy remains providing financial security for our esteemed customers and as always, we will not fail to exceed our customers’ and stakeholders’ expectations.”
