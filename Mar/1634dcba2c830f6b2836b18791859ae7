 A head of the October 10 governorship poll, loyalists of former Ondo State governor Olusegun Mimiko yesterday dumped the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP). Mimiko used the platform (ZLP) after dumping the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to contest the senatorial election last year. He lost the election to the PDP’s candidate, Senator Ayo Akinyelure. The former ZLP members were, however, silent on the new party they would join. They said that their action was hinged on people’s welfare. Political analysts, however, predicted that the defectors might join the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) based on the fact that some former aides of Mimiko, including his deputy, Alhaji Lasisi Oluboyo, last weekend defected to the APC.  At a news conference in Akure yesterday, former deputy chairman of ZLP in the state, Adebayo Abayomi, said the decision to dump the ZLP followed wide consultations. He said that the former Mimiko loyalists who dumped ZLP included ex-state executive members of the party, local government officials and ward leaders of the party. Abayomi said the former ZLP members, under the aegis of Grassroots Progressive Network (GPM), have not decided on the particular party to join during the coming governorship election. He, however, said the leader of the group, Olubunmi Tunji Ojo (BTO), who represents Akoko West and East Federal Constituency, is a member of the APC. The former ZLP loyalists said their new party would be announced soon, urging the public to team up with them to build a virile party.
