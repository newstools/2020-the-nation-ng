In one of the worst-hit countries by COVID-19, Spain-based  Super Eagles winger , Samuel Chukwueze,   has revealed how he was coping with his daily routine, reports AOIFootball.com. The Villarreal of Spain speedster said living alone  makes the stay at home compulsory but very difficult for him as he had to  create different activities to cure boredom. Chukwueze follows the club’s personal daily training schedule as sent to all the players but also involves himself in watching Nigerian movies and playing games. “Really I am glad I have been able to combat boredom these 15 days or so. I observe my training regimen as scheduled and I also watch plenty of Nigerian and western movies to kill time every day. I also play a lot of soccer and other games on my PlayStation,” he said. Meanwhile, Nigeria’s Dutch Eredivisie top scorer Cyriel Dessers has said that he is very bored and misses the round leather game of football. Dessers has scored 15 times this season in the Eredivisie, making him the joint top scorer in the league and was having a great season before the novel coronavirus struck and shut down the game he loves. Dessers, who also possesses a Belgian heritage, was delighted when he was recently called up for the first to feature for the Super Eagles of Nigeria. “I miss football a lot but there is nothing we can do for now except to ensure we fight to stay alive,” says the former FC Utrecht forward. “To fight this virus and stay alive, we must maintain social distance, wash our hands properly at least for 20 seconds and stay hydrated and avoid sneezing and coughing improperly in public.” he concluded.
