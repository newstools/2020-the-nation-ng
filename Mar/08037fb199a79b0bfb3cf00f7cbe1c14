The Late Rangers International striker Ifeanyi Onwubiko George will be buried today in Lagos. George died along with Emmanuel Ogbu and Gabriel Eteka who were in the same vehicle with him while he was returning to Lagos last Sunday after his car rammed into a parked articulated vehicle at Abudu along Benin/Asaba Expressway. The attacker was going back home to reunite with his family after Rangers gave their players two weeks break because of the halt to football activities (including the Nigeria Professional Football League games) owing to the coronavirus pandemic when he met his untimely death. Rangers where he last played have, however, made adequate plans to ensure he is given a befitting burial. The Media Manager of Rangers International, Nobert Okoli stated that the body of George was taken to Lagos from the morgue at Abudu along Benin/Asaba Expressway on Thursday evening by Ifeanyi’s brother Corporal Sunny George to another mortuary in Lagos. Okoli confirmed that Rangers settled the bills incurred at the Abudu Mortuary and that they also paid for his casket and the ambulance that took him to Lagos. He added that Rangers are facilitating the release of the player’s Insurance premium to his family. Okoli pointed out that only a few family members and friends would be allowed to grace the burial of the player at an undisclosed cemetery due to the ban on large gathering in Lagos occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic. “Our former attacking sensation, the Late Ifeanyi George Onwubiko, will be buried tomorrow (today),” the message from Okoli said. “With the prevailing health situation in the country, only few family members and friends will be allowed to witness the sad event. Adieu!! George Onwubiko Ifeanyi, ‘Odogwu’!!!! R.I.P!!!!” Meanwhile, the remains of ex-Rangers International feeder team player, Emmanuel Ogbu was committed to mother earth yesterday in Onicha, Ebonyi State amidst tears.
