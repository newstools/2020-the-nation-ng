Deputy Senate President Ovie Omo-Agege has dissociated himself from the disparaging statements, being circulated against some chieftains of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the Southsouth geopolitical zone. Omo-Agege, who is the leader of the party in the Southsouth, was absent at last Thursday’s consultative meeting called by Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki at the Edo State House in Abuja. He accused those he called fifth columnists of fueling crisis in the zonal chapter of the party in the Southsouth. In a statement yesterday by his Special Adviser, Media and Publicity, Yomi Odunuga, the deputy senate president blamed the statements credited on handiwork of fifth columnists and agents of destabilisation, masquerading as his supporters. According to him, such disparaging remarks borne out of puerile thoughts of mischief-makers against the ruling party’s stalwarts from the Southsouth zone or any part of the Federation can never emanate from him. Senator Omo-Agege noted that some enemies of the region were hell-bent on causing disaffection in the Southsouth. The statement reads: “For the avoidance of doubt, the Deputy President of the Senate did not make any disparaging remarks against any personality from the Southsouth geopolitical zone. “For the records, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege would like to be left out of whatever mischievous scheme or deadly politics being played out by some unscrupulous characters in the region for whatever selfish reasons. “His focus, as he has always stated, is to bring qualitative development to the South-South for the benefits of all the people. “He would not be distracted by the antics of social media rats who continue to abuse the privilege offered by the social media to publish falsehood against him with the aim of setting him up against other leaders in the region. “We implore all well-meaning supporters and media houses to always verify sources of statements before circulating such as fifth columnists abound everywhere.”
