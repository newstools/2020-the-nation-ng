All seems set for the commencement of human and animal trials for a British vaccine against the coronavirus later this week at the government’s secret science base Porton Down. Scientists will test the drug, made at Oxford University, on animals at the Wiltshire base before trying on humans next month. The Phase II trials, according to The Times of London, will begin before the results of the animal trials are known. However, Professor Robin Shattock of Imperial College London has warned that vaccines would not be made widely available until next year ‘at the earliest’. He told the BBC’s World at One the first part of testing is to check that it is safe in humans in small numbers, and again induces the right sort of immune response. “That will take, even if we do things quickly, two to three months,” he said. He added: “The next stage would be to ramp it up and start looking at whether the vaccine actually can prevent infection in the community. “You need to produce the data to show a vaccine works and how well it works before you can get a licence to sell that as a product.” Other drugs that are being tested as potential antidotes to Covid-19 include anti-malaria medicine, and treatment for ebola. They include: Remdesivir – developed to combat ebola. It is being tested on Covid-19 in at least five clinical trials. Experiments suggest it works against SARS and MERS; Kaletra – normally used to treat HIV. However, a study involving 200 seriously-ill Covid-19 patients from China found no benefit; Chloroquine – used to combat malaria. Experiments involving 36 French Covid-19 patients showed that 70 percent given it recovered within six days; Favipiravir – a Japanese flue treatment which helped 340 Chinese patients recover in four days, compared with 11 days in those who did not.
