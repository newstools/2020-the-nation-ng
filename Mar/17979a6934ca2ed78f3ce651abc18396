Paris Saint Germain (PSG) on Tuesday subjected Kylian Mbappé to a test to see if he is COVID-19 positive, after missing two days (Monday and Tuesday) training with a throat infection and fever,  reports French news outlet, L’Équipe. The results of the test should be back today , but initial testing suggests that his swabs will come back negative for coronavirus. This means that the PSG medical department’s initial hypothesis, that Mbappé has a throat infection, is accurate. Meanwhile, football matches in the top two divisions in Spain and France will be played behind closed doors for at least the next two weeks, officials announced yesterday, following the decision by Italy’s government to suspend top-flight games until April 3 due to the coronavirus epidemic. German football also felt the effects of the deadly virus, which has killed more than 4,000 people worldwide, with fans barred from two Bundesliga games as well as the national team’s March 31 friendly at home to Italy.
