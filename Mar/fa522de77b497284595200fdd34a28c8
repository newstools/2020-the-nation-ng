People in power are often not certain of tomorrow. While it has become a common practice for Supreme Court to sack politicians from their positions, President Muhammadu Buhari has also been making changes in political offices. Dr. Dakuku Peterside, an ally of the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, is reportedly the latest personality to leave his seat. During the week, news emerged that Buhari has appointed another person as the Director-General of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA). Peterside, who was appointed by the Buhari administration in 2016, is expected to end his tenure on March 10, 2020. With his wealth of experience, it shouldn’t take Peterside forever to move on. He has enjoyed good fortunes in his political career. He was elected to the House of Representatives in 2011 and served as chairman, House Committee on Petroleum Resources. As Commissioner of Works in Rivers State, he was said to have managed the largest construction portfolio ever in the history of the state. Peterside has also served as Executive director, Development and Leadership Institute, Senior Special Assistant to Governor of Rivers State on Works, Chairman, Opobo–Nkoro LGA and Special Assistant to Governor of Rivers State on Youths and Student Affairs.
