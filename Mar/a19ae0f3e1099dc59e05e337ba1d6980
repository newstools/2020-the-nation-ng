 BADAGRY Local Government residents were on Thursday sensitised on the scourge of diseases. Speaking at a sensitisation programme  organised by the Badagry Local Government, the Chairman, Mr. Olusegun Onilude, said it was necessary to enlighten the people on the scourge of Lassa Fever, Ebola, Coronavirus and other strange and deadly diseases. He said the aim of the programme was to let them be on guard and not to panic. Onilude advised the residents to adopt the old system of keeping the environment clean, to prevent diseases. He said the washing of hand is imperative, urging the people to engage in hygienic and healthy activities. “Wash your hands after eating, greeting, playing or before entering a place. “Always cover your mouth or nose or use handkerchief when you cough. We have to be hygiene conscious,” the council boss said. He said that they invited chairmen of Community Development Committee (CDC) for the programme so that they could go back to their communities and educate their people on the diseases. The Chief Medical Officer, Badagry Local Government, Dr. Michael Ariyibi, said the programme is necessary because Badagry is a border town. He said that the sensitisation would enable the residents to know the danger and how to prevent it. The Chairman of CDC, Mr. Omotoyosi Ajadi, said that chairmen of the Community Development Associations would be mobilised to sensitise their people on the symptoms of the diseases. He praised Onilude for organising the programme.
