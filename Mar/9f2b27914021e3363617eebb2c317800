By Gbenga Bada  THE search for a replacement for Ndidi Obi, who plays the titular role of Nneka in ‘Nneka the pretty serpent,’ has begun. The Nation learned that Charles Okpaleke of Play Network, who bought the rights of the 1992 Nollywood classic, has kicked off the search for the right fit for the role. An excited Okpaleke had noted, “The time is now! We would be visiting different geopolitical zones nationwide to just to find a new face that would befit such an iconic role for this Nollywood classic. Who would be our Nneka?” Meanwhile auditions for the role of Nneka in the remake of the Nollywood classic, ‘Nneka the pretty serpent’ will kick off in Nigeria’s Federal Capital, Abuja on Thursday, March 12 till Sunday, March 15. The search party moves to Owerri on March 13 and Lagos on Sunday, March 15. The original classic was produced by Okechukwu Ogunjiofor and directed by Zeb Ejiro in 1992. The film had Ndidi Obi taking the lead role of Nneka while veterans like Eucharia Anunobi, Ngozi Ezeonu, Rita Nzelu, Sam Loco, Kanayo O.Kanayo, James Iroha, Claude Eke, and Nelly Uchendu took up different roles in the film. Okpaleke had embarked a journey of remaking old Nollywood classics after he remade ‘Living in Bondage’ and got a good response from fans and movie buffs in 2019. The Nollywood executive producer had also acquired the rights to Nollywood classics – ‘Glamour Girls’ and ‘RattleSnake.’ Okpaleke says the remake of ‘Nneka the pretty serpent’ has been scheduled for a November/December 2020 release.
