Rangers’ striker Jermain Defoe insists football has to take a back seat as Scotland deals with the coronavirus pandemic. The game has been suspended since March 13 due to the health crisis, with no firm date set for its return. And at 37 years of age, Defoe knows time is not on his side in regards to the rest of his career but he stressed that football has become unimportant amid a rising death tally due to the virus. “To be honest, there are more important things happening in the world than football,” he told TalkSport. “People are dying every day which is such a sad thing, it puts things into perspective and you think, you know what, football is not important at all at this moment in time. The most important thing is the people who are actually suffering and the families that are losing loved ones.”
