Chris Njoku, Owerri Leader of proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu has said the struggle for the actualisation of sovereign state of Biafra will be accomplished in his life time. He said this on Sunday in a recorded audio made available to the Nation in Owerri, Imo State. Kanu said that those asking for Igbo presidency are wasting their time as such agitation was not what the Igbo need but actualisation of Biafra. “Those asking for Igbo presidency are wasting their time. We don’t need your presidency, what we need is Biafra.” He vowed that actualisation of sovereign state of Biafra would be realised in his life time as the IPOB was determined to liberate Biafraland from the clutches of darkness.

The governors from South East cannot form the security outfit without IPBO. We are just keeping quiet to see if they can form it without IPOB and we know they cannot, “he emphasized. He wondered why the people are calling on the governors to form security outfit for the zone when it was the governors that connived and supported the Nigerian government to ban IPOB who would have provided security for the people. He however disclosed that plan was underway for IPOB to roll out a strategy that would protect Ndigbo from frequent attacks by the Fulani herdsmen.
