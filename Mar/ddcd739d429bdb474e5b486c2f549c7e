The English Premier League (EPL), England’s top-flight football tournament, is hoping to resume by June 1 so that it could wrap up the season over the next six weeks and be ready to start the 2020-21 season by August. The idea behind this is to help the club lessen the gravity of losses the clubs are currently incurring as they continue to pay wages even as football remains shut due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. The only hindrance standing in the way are the contracts of certain players, most of which are expected to end in June, but the FIFA governing body has said it will look into possibilities.  The Premier League was almost assured of a new champion in Liverpool, who needed just two more wins to be crowned winners, but with the Coronavirus affecting all spheres of life, on March 13, all elite level soccer matches in England, including the EPL, were suspended until April 4, later extended till April 30. With the Euro Championships postponed to 2021, the EPL has a chance to slot in that time bracket, provided circumstances are good enough for football to resume. That said, the plan proposed plan suggests that matches – for both EPL and the FA Cup – be played inside closed doors. The 2020-21 campaign would get underway after a short break on Aug. 8, the report said, allowing the league to fulfill its commitments in the second season of three-year broadcast deals worth 9.2 billion pounds ($10.73 billion).
