Gbenga Bada  Terry G has opened up on his reason for going through a process of rebranding. The Ginjah master says the only sure change in the music industry is change and that is why he has decided to rebrand. “Sure change is constant and I think this is the time to give my fans some other side of me they probably don’t know,” the Akpako master told The Nation. Speaking further, Terry G says, “The street vibe should be expressed in any style of sound, not just the fast tempo, and that’s where I am driving to with my rebranding.”  The self-styled singer, who doubles as a singer cum music producer and music video director says he misses nothing about his past. He went on to say his past reign was a process to where he is at the moment as well as his future. Terry G recently recorded a new song with Skiibii entitled ‘Adura’. The yet-to-be-released song is a follow up to his collaborative effort with Pretty Boy DO entitled ‘Inspiration’.
