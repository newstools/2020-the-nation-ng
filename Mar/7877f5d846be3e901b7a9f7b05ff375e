KOLADE ADEYEMI, Kano  The Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN) has raised alarm over an alleged plot to infect their embattled leader, Sheikh Ibrahim El-Zakzaky, at the Kaduna Correctional Centre where he is being kept. The leader of the movement in Kano, Sheikh Dr Sanusi Abdulkadir Koki, made the allegation on Tuesday, during a press conference held at the NUJ Secretariat. “We would like to use this medium to renew the call for the immediate and unconditional release of our leader Sheikh Ibraheem Zakzaky (H) and his wife who are currently detained at the highly overcrowded Kaduna Correctional Centre, without access to proper medical care, especially considering that the Kaduna State Government has proved incapable of protecting even its highest ranking officials. “We are aware of the recent developments in the Correctional Centre in Kaduna and are calling on the authorities to immediately and unconditionally release the Sheikh having allegedly implanted the said COVID-19 in the Correctional Centre Kaduna where he is being kept. Definitely we will hold the authorities responsible lest anything happens to our leader,” Sheikh Koki has warned. The IMN then called on the general public to compliment the efforts of health experts and comply with instructions and guidance to curb the spread of the novel Corona Virus now taking a toll in the country and the world. The movement then faulted Nigeria’s approach towards curbing the spread of the disease in the country. “We wish to express our dismay over the carelessness of the Nigerian authorities that led to the spread of the pandemic to Nigeria from the onset, due to its indifference, disregard to the life and wellbeing of the citizenry and its inability to be proactive,” Sheikh Koki said.
