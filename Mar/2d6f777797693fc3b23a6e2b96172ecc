The Commissioner, Youth Political Participation in Africa at the Pan-African Youth Union (PYU), Amb. Oladele Nihi, has announced postponement of the forthcoming program tagged Sustainable Democracy in Africa with the theme: GEJtocracy – Post 2015 Nigeria Presidential Election due to coronavirus outbreak. Nihi said the event, which was scheduled to take place at the International Conference Centre, Abuja on 31st March, is indefinitely postponed “as a preventive measure, in accordance with instructions from government authorities, and to reinforce the coordination of international directives. “After consultation with the National Executive Council of Pan-African Youth Union, government officials and stakeholders, I wish to announce to the general public that we have decided to postpone our forthcoming program in order to ensure the safety of all intended participants, collaborators, local and international guests.” He said although they regret any inconveniences this postponement might cause “we believe is in the best interest of all particularly that our Guest Speaker, Keynote Speaker and four of the seven panelists are International guests who will not be able to fly into the country as a result of the closed down of all International airports and the ban on large gathering by Nigeria Government”.
