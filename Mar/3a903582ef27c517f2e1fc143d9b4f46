The Vice-Chancellor who was represented by Prof. Osamade Omorogiuwa, spoke last Thursday  during the institution’s matriculation for degree programmes students Federal College of Education (Technical) FCET, Akoka, Lagos run in affiliation with UNIBEN. “I urge you to see your admission as a rare opportunity for which you must be grateful, and a privilege which you must protect and guard jealously throughout your stay here because not all your peers have been lucky. I am sure all of you will opt to work assiduously to achieve your dreams and aspirations,” he said. While noting that UNIBEN was one of the most sought-after universities in the country, he said graduates of the institution were competitive in the labour market and excel in postgraduate studies at home and abroad.

The university and college have the focused and committed philosophy and values upon which they are established, to provide qualitative science and vocational and technical education to students who in-turn, will impart the knowledge to larger societies.” Comrade Omotola Adewale, President, Degree Students Association advised them to shun violence on campus, noting that there are other alternatives to resolving disputes. “Avoid all forms of violent fighting on campus. It brings nothing but destruction or utter retardation. Rather than resorting to violence, there are other things that can be done to settle conflict.”
