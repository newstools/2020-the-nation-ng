Nigeria climbed one place in the latest FIFA Women’s World ranking, moving from 39 to 38 and thus retain its top spot in Africa. Though Nigeria improved in the ranking, the team has not played a competitive game since last October’s Olympic qualifiers. The biggest mover in the latest ranking is Zambia, the Shepolopolo climbed six places to 100th globally. Zambia has played twice since the turn of the year, facing Cameroon in an Olympic qualifying double header. The Shepolopolo qualified for their debut appearance in the football event of the Olympics with an aggregate victory over the Lionesses. Zambia lost the first leg 3-2 in Yaounde, but picked up a famous 2-1 win in the return leg. Meanwhile, only two countries moved in Africa’s top five; Nigeria and South Africa, the latter stepping up two places. World champions USA are still the highest ranked team in the world, while Germany, France, Netherlands and Sweden make up the top five.
