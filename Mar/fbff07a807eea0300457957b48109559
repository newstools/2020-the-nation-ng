Oluwo of Iwoland, Oba Abdulrasheed Akanbi, may have been suspended from carrying out his duties as a king by the Osun State Council of Traditional Rulers for six months, but it didn’t stop him from reacting to the deadly coronavirus, which he describes as an attack on human race. On his Instagram page, he reached out to the people of Iwo, Osun and Nigeria at large, emphasising on the need to stay safe. He said it was necessary to shun religious gatherings at the moment to control the spread of the virus. He stated: “Coronavirus is deadly. Stay where you are, wash your hands, keep your family safe, pray in your house for now and don’t go for Jummat or Church on Sunday. If you have visitors from overseas, stay away from them for now. God bless you all and may God heal the world from this deadly virus. Last month, Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, presided over the meeting held at Osun State Government Secretariat, where a decision was arrived at to suspend Oba Akanbi.
