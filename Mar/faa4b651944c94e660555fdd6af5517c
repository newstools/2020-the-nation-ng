Governor Duoye Diri of Bayelsa State said on Friday night that the General Overseer of The Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adeboye, prophesied his recent victory at the Supreme Court. Diri was giving a testimony  at the Redemption Camp on the  Lagos-Ibadan Expressway during RCCG’s monthly Holy Ghost Service. He told the congregation that  he participated  in the   December 11, 2019  Great Turn Around programme of the church during which he met Pastor Adeboye  who prayed for him. “After the service, I went to see Daddy G.O. He prayed for me and thereafter, he said, ‘It is well. Go and when you receive it, come back to the church,’” he said. “The judicial processes continued until the 14th of February about 24 hours to the swearing-in ceremony of the alleged winner. Brethren, a miracle was accomplished. The Supreme Court declared me the winner of that election. “I have come to give Him (God) the glory and to return the glory to Him and to Him alone. “I want to thank Daddy G.O. and all of you who stood with me in prayers. “Today, I am the governor of Bayelsa State.” Diri was proclaimed governor by the Supreme Court just 24 hours before the swearing in of Mr.David Lyon of the APC who was returned by the Independent national Electoral Commissioner as the winner of the November election
