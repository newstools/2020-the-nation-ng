 The Nigerian Institute of Building (NOIB) has urged the Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, not to relent in ensuring that the National Building Code is operational. Its President, Kunle Awobodu, said: “From manufacturers of building materials to building artisans and professionals, the culture of doing it right must be embraced.’’ He spoke during the conferment of the institute’s fellowship on the minister in recognition of his contributions to the built environment. He added that any nation bereft of building codes is vulnerable to inappropriate building construction, stressing that stakeholders in the built environment had  been canvassing that building construction should be guided by the National Building Code, which ensures that licensed builders manage production of buildings on site to ascertain quality output.  Responding, Fashola said: “I have found it difficult and I still find it difficult to take in the credit for any work that the team does and, therefore, this award is a reward of collective effort and so I wear this gown and I doff this hat on behalf of all the members of my team. “I believe that building is a very ennobling undertaking. It ennobles the builder and the beneficiary,” he said, adding that those who build contribute to prosperity, hence the need to take the business of building seriously. “It is good to build brick and mortar but it is also important to build knowledge and values because it is knowledge and values that give meaning to brick and mortar and so if we build without knowledge and values, it will not last.’’
