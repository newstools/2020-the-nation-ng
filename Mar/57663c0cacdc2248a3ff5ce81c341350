In 2019, Franklin Ubi was appointed by Governor Ben Ayade as Special Adviser on Tourism. Ubi’s job description is clear, however, his antecedents in the industry remain what has kept entertainment buffs talking. Ubi became a major factor in the entertainment circle in 2012 after he formed the recording label, Made Men Music Group, MMMG, with his erstwhile partner and music sensation, Iyanya. The business and personal relationship between Ubi and Iyanya seemed heavenly. They rolled like Siamese twins until they fell out. After falling out, Ubi had since moved on while Iyanya is yet to recover. Ubi moved on with Tekno, who was signed on MMMG and the young talent became the toast of industry players until his contract expired and both parties parted ways. Since parting ways – amicably – with Ubi, Tekno has been struggling to find his way back to the top of chats. Now that Ubi holds a position in Governor Ayade’s cabinet, it is left to be seen if his magic touch would extend to that sector and what happens if he exits.
