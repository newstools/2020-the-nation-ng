Anthony Joshua’s promoter Eddie Hearn has once again claimed that a serious delay to the unified heavyweight champion’s scheduled title defence against Kubrat Pulev could pave the way for an end-of-year unification fight with Tyson Fury. The most-anticipated fight in the history of British boxing is within touching distance following Fury’s demolition of Deontay Wilder last month, which saw him claim the WBC heavyweight title. Shortly after ‘The Gypsy King’ ended Wilder’s five-year reign atop of the WBC heavyweight rankings, a unification bout with Joshua became the talk of the boxing world. Should Joshua and Fury win their respective bouts against Pulev and Wilder, an end-of-year showdown will likely come to fruition. Joshua is tentatively scheduled to defend his unified titles against Pulev on June 20 at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, although the coronavirus outbreak could delay the plan.  But should Joshua’s first outing since reclaiming the unified throne be delayed by several months, Hearn will turn his attention to securing a unification fight against the winner of Fury’s trilogy fight with Wilder. During an appearance on BBC Radio 5 Live, Hearn said: “Right now our plan is to fight Pulev in June or July, then fight Fury or whoever holds the WBC belt at the time. “If the Pulev fight can’t take place we may end up seeing that fight [against Fury] happen later this year.” Hearn’s latest comments on a multi-million-pound showdown between Joshua and Fury echo those he made earlier this month during an interview with Sky Sports, in which he revealed the former’s clash with Pulev could take place on July 25.
