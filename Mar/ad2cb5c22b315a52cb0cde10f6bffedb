Like a cat with nine lives, All Progressives Congress (APC) national chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole has survived another plot to oust him from office. It was the second time in less than three months that forces failed to boot him out of office. President Muhammadu Buhari set the tone for Oshiomholeâ€™s survival when he summoned an emergency meeting with APC Governors for today. The National Executive Council (NEC) meeting where forces were waiting to oust Oshiomhole was scheduled for tomorrow, but was called off indefinitely at the meeting between Buhari and the governors. Hours later, The Court of Appeal, Abuja stayed execution of the March 4, 2020 order of a High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) restraining Oshiomhole from further acting as national chairman. It was a sweet victory for Oshiomhole, who has been in the eyes of the storm in the last few weeks. Here are 10 takeaways from the development: The NWC has announced Waziri Bulama to take over as national secretary. Giadom, who is believed to be sponsored by Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, will revert to his original designation as Deputy National Secretary, that is, if Oshiomhole and others agree that he did not resign to contest as running mate to Tonye Cole in the 2019 governorship election in Rivers state.. Fayemi wants to be a running mate to a northern presidential candidate in 2023 while Bagudu and El-Rufai are strongly believed to be scheming for the presidential ticket. Obaseki, on his part, wants a second term ticket. With Oshiomhole back in office their desire for a pliant chairman may never be realised; thus their ambitions also.
