Chief of Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, has said the Nigeria Air Force (NAF) will name projects after its personnel that died in the line of duty. Abubakar spoke at the inauguration of a newly built and furnished block of 20 units of single bedroom accommodation for personnel of the 271 NAF Detachment (271 NAF Det) at Birinin Gwari in Kaduna State. He also restated the commitment of the Air Force to defend the nation’s territorial integrity. “I am pleased to note that this building and other projects yet to be inaugurated would be named after those personnel who paid the supreme price in the line of duty. While we pray for the repose of their souls, I urge officers, airmen and airwomen to continue to display the values of selflessness, bravery and dedication in the conduct of their respective duties,” he added. Also, the Air Task Force (ATF) of Operation Lafiya Dole has destroyed the hideouts of the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) at Mina on the Gulumba Gana-Kumshe axis in northern part of Borno State. Scores of the terrorists were killed in the operation, which was part of the current Operation Decisive Edge. A statement by NAF’s Director of Public Relations and Information, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, said the operation was undertaken after a NAF Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft spotted the terrorists assembling in the vicinity of some compounds within the settlement. “Fighter jets scrambled by the ATF to engage the location scored accurate hits in the target area, leading to the destruction of some terrorists’ structures as well as the neutralisation of some of their fighters.” “The NAF, in furtherance of the objective of restoring peace and security in the Northeast and operating in concert with surface forces, will continue to carry out air interdiction missions against the enemies of our nation,” the statement said.
