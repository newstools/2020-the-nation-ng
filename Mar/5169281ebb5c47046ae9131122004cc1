Our Reporter  The Ondo State government has said it will partner the Army to mobilise youths for recruitment into the military. Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu spoke on Wednesday in Akure when the Army’s Director of Recruitment, Resettlement and Reserve, Brig.-Gen. Henry Akpan, visited him. Akeredolu, represented by his deputy, Agboola Ajayi, hailed soldiers for sustaining Nigeria’s unity, and called on the military not to compromise the recruitment. He said the government would support the military to enlighten mentally and physically-fit youths for the recruitment. Akeredolu, however, urged the Army to ensure that those to be recruited were genuine indigenes. Gen. Akpan, who solicited the government’s support in sensitising the public ahead of the recruitment, said the sensitisation tour was informed by the Army’s desire to keep Nigerians abreast of its training approach. He said: “It is aimed at educating our brothers and sisters, citizens of Ondo State, on the Army’s current approach to training of its personnel, both serving and those to be recruited into the system. “It is also sequel to the directive of the Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen. Tukur Buratai, that Special Forces training concept should be incorporated into the Army training. That means all personnel in the Army, and those we intend to recruit into the system, must undergo Special Forces training.”
