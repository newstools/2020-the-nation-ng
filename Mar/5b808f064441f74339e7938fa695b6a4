Being the excerpts of a keynote address delivered by Femi Falana SAN at the 18th Anti-Corruption Situation Room on Review of the Fight Against Corruption held by the Human Rights and Environmental Development Agenda (HEDA) at Abuja.   Conclusion Permit me to conclude this address by insisting that the fight against corruption cannot succeed without the involvement of the people who are the direct victims of the menace. Therefore, the labour movement and other progressive forces in the country should not hesitate to take advantage of the new official policy to mobilise the masses to demand accountability from all public officers. This should start with popular participation in the preparation and execution of annual budgets of all tiers of government. President Kagame has said that “we want to create wealth, not merely fighting corruption.” Let the Federal Government take up the challenge by creating wealth to fund the rights of the Nigerian people to education, health and other basic amenities.
