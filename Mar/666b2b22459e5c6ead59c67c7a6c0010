 The Chairman, Nasarawa State Football Association, Mohammed Alkali has assured that all necessary medical equipment required for hosting a hitch-free game in todayâ€™s Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) clash between Nasarawa United and Akwa United at the Lafia City Stadium has been provided. The League Management Company (LMC) had last week ordered that no matches shall be hosted at the Lafia Township Stadium, until medical requirements and measures stipulated in the league rules are fully complied with. The order was placed on the stadium due to the sudden death of Nasarawa United defender, Chineme Martins who slumped on the pitch during the Matchday 23 fixture between Nasarawa United and Katsina United. He told NationSport, that the State Governor Abdullahi Sule has provided needed equipment at the stadium, stressing the state is still sad over the death of Martins.
