EFE Ajagba will continue his rise through the top heavyweight division ranks when he faces former title challenger Razvan Cojanu in Barclays Center, Brooklyn, New York on Saturday. The scheduled 10-round heavyweight affair will be the co-feature of the card headlined by Adam Kownacki versus Robert Helenius Ajagba, undefeated in 12 fights, was knocked down for the first time in his professional career when Iago Kiladze dropped him with a thunderous right hand in the third round last december. This was after Ajagba had dropped Kiladze with a straight right down the middle late in the second round. In the fifth round, Ajagba dropped Kiladze again, but he got up on unsteady legs. Ajagba was unloading unanswered shots on Kiladze when the ring doctor climbed on the apron waving a white towel, signaling that the fight was over, giving the Nigerian his twelfth straight professional win. Ajagba admitted he made some mistakes during the fight against Kiladze, adding that he has worked hard in the gym with his coach Ronnie Shields to rectify them. “The last fight, I made a lot of big mistakes,” Ajagba admitted. “My head movement and defense has to be better. I did get up. I was surprised I was put down. It is boxing, and one punch can put you down.
