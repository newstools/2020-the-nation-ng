The Director-General, Industrial Training Fund (ITF), Joseph Ari, has reiterated the commitment of the Fund to skill acquisition. He said the ITF remains the most viable and sustainable solution to taming rising unemployment and poverty in the land. This, he explained, is why the ITF is investing in training and empowerment of students. For instance, he said about 11,000 trainees that are undergoing training at the ITF’s National Industrial Skills Development Programe (NISDP) would soon graduate. Ari noted that like previous beneficiaries of the programme, the graduates would be empowered with the start-up packs to start their own businesses. He therefore urged parents and guardians to encourage their children and wards to embrace skills acquisition, as white collar jobs were no longer available. The ITF boss explained that the only way for President Muhammadu Buhari to actualise his promise of taking 100 million Nigerians out of poverty before the end of his tenure, was for individuals to acquire skills and reaffirmed the determination of the ITF to ensure that as many as possible were equipped with relevant skills for employability and growth. “In all, over 11,000 Nigerians were equipped with skills in nine trades, namely, Leather works (shoe and bag-making), welding and fabrication, catering and event management, tilling, production and laying of interlock, and tiling. ‘’Since inception, ITF has  trained over 300,000 Nigerians on skill acquisition programmes across the country,” Ari said. He added that government is providing avenues to substantially increase access to affordable credit through schemes such as the N250 billion Central Bank, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME) fund; the Growth Enterprises and Empowerment Programme (GEEP) and developing alternative collateral programmes for SMEs to ensure that youths are given support to translate the acquired skills into poverty reduction and job creation.
