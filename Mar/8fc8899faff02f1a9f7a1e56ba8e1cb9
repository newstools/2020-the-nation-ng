 A CHINESE steel company in Amuwo Odofin, Lagos State, has been operating despite government’s directive to non-essential products and service dealers to close, it was learnt. To contain the Coronavirus disease, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu ordered closure of markets and public places. Sanwo-Olu said gatherings should not exceed 25 and people must observe a metre distance from one other. However,  it was learnt for the company in Amuwo Odofin it was business as usual. At the company on Monday, The Nation discovered vehicular and human movement in and out of the premises. Visitors were cleared from the gate and allowed access to the company. About five private security guards sat by a table nearby with an open register in front of them. Sources alleged the management threatened to sack any worker who stayed at home despite government’s directives. A statement they sent to The Nation read: “The Chinese authorities took a drastic action against … against Coronavirus …to stem further spread … but …some Chinese …with the connivance of their Nigerian directors are so determined to send millions of innocent Nigerians to their early grave as a result of the exposure most of these helpless Nigerians may suffer.
