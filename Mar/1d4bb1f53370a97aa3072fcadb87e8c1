Senate President Ahmad Lawan on Monday urged the nation’s managers and administrators of education to consider a review of the curricula at all levels. Lawan spoke in Abuja while declaring open a public hearing on three bills seeking to establish three Federal educational institutions: Federal College of Education, Mutun Biyu in Taraba State; Federal College of Education, Giwa in Kaduna State and Federal College of Education, Ibokun in Osun State. The public hearing was organised by the Senate Committee on Tertiary Institutions and the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETfund). “The time has come; actually, we are late in reviewing our curricula to reflect our desire and need to produce manpower for a 21st century economy. “At this time, we cannot continue to use the curricula developed 40 or 50 years ago and expect to have an economy that is knowledge-based. “We don’t have to have oil; there are so many countries that have no oil. But because they concentrated on developing their peopleo educationally, and the right education, today, their economies are doing so well, based largely on what their people can do. “We go to India. We go to Malaysia. We go to Singapore; even China. So, we need to review our curricula at all levels. If not, we will produce teachers that will teach students who will come and later become teachers,” he said.
