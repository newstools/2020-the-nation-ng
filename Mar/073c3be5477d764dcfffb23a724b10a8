JORDAN Ayew’s goal lifted Crystal Palace to a 1-0 victory at Brighton in the Premier League that left the hosts still looking for their first win of 2020. Yesterday’s loss at their Amex Stadium ground meant Brighton have drawn five and lost four of their last nine games in all competitions since their victory over local south coast rivals Bournemouth on December 28. The Seagulls are the only club in English football’s top four divisions without a victory in the calendar year and this loss left them just four points above the relegation zone. Palace, by contrast, remain comfortably in mid-table, with the London club, managed by former England boss Roy Hodgson, 12 points from the bottom three. It was an all too familiar story for Brighton, who’ve won just once in their past 14 matches.
