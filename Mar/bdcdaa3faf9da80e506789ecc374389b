 PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday flagged off  the  Argungu Festival Automobile rally at the Eagle Square, Abuja. Buhari assured that his administration was ready to support the automotive industry, which is capable of generating billions of dollars yearly as the government is set to develop the tourism sector. Represented by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Muhammed said   the introduction of local content at the festival explains the government’s priority on made-in Nigeria goods and products. Buhari said the government would continue to  support the festival to boost tourism. ‘’This administration is ready to commit to diversification of the economy through industrialisation and tourism,’’ he said. He noted that vehicles for the rally were assembled in Nigeria, which was part of efforts to boost and showcase Nigeria’s automotive industry. The Director-General, National Automotive Design and Development Council (NADDC), Jelani Aliyu, said the festival would showcase Nigeria’s manufactured and assembled vehicles. Aliyu said the NADDC would continue to work with relevant stakeholders to develop the automotive industry in line with international best practice. The rally is the premier motor sport in Nigeria. ‘’We are very excited about this because it is an invaluable opportunity for Nigerians to be shown the high quality, durability and ruggedness of these locally assembled vehicles,’’ he said. The very fact that we have these vehicles here and ready to race shows the immeasurable contribution that the local automotive assemblers have made, first by investing in Nigeria to produce them and secondly, by making them available to be in this historic race. We very much appreciate this commitment.
