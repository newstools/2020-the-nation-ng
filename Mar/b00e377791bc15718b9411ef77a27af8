 No fewer than 60,000 administrators, students, academics and teachers have been sponsored and trained in various digital and Information Communication Technology (ICT)-related skills by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC)  through the Digital Bridge Institute (DBI). DBI President, Prof Mohammed Ajiya, who spoke with reporters, said the sponsorship and training were done since the inception of the DBI in 2004. He added that more campuses of the DBI were to resume in Yola, Enugu and Asaba to add impetus to the operations of the ones in Abuja, Lagos and Kano. He said those who benefited from the training were drawn from across the country’s secondary schools and tertiary institutions as well government agencies.  He said the DBI, in partnership with Microsoft, Hauwei Technology and Global System of Mobile communications Association (GSMA), had the certification of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the accreditation of NBTE to run courses and programmes on digital and ICT-related fields to up scale the skills. Ajiya said the government was investing heavily on broadband expansion and provision of telecoms infrastructure for the transformation of the economy, adding that there is the need for the nation to leverage the e-governance platforms to meet up with the challenges of employment for youths.
