Our Reporter  Emirates Airlines has invested over $1 billion on its wine programmes. Its Regional Manager, West Africa, Afzal Parambil, made this known in an interview with The Nation at a wine tasting ceremony by the carrier at the weekend in Lagos. Parambil said a lot of investment has been made on the wine programme in the last ten years. He said Emirates established a robust win programme in the last 10 years. The airline, he said, sources its wines from 12 countries, including  Argentina, Australia, Austria, Chile, France, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Portugal, South Africa, Spain and United States. Parambil said: “Since 2006, Emirates has invested about $1 billion in its wine programme. As an airline, over 2.2 million bottles of champagne and wine have been served on First and Business Class, while 2.6 million bottles have been served in Economy class. Across the network daily, we offer 80 Champagnes, wines and ports, over 30 spirits, Aperitifs, and Liqueurs, and about 14 cocktails.  “In every aspect of our business, our aim is to provide the best experience for our customers and we have curated a wine programme that is reflective of that promise. We are proud of the fact that our wine lists are comparable to what you might find in a top restaurant in the best cities around the world.” “We serve 80 different champagnes, wines and ports on our flights on an average day in all classes across our international network. “The wines on each route are carefully selected to complement the menu and include exclusives found only on Emirates such as the Dom Pérignon 2005 Rosé champagne and 1963 Graham’s Colheita Port. A long term buying strategy also means that the airline has 7.4 million bottles of wines currently stored in its cellar in Burgundy, France, some of which will only be served in 2037.”
