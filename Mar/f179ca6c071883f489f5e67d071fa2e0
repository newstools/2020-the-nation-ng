Lagos State Water Regulatory Commission (LSWRC) has advised residents to pay attention to the use of clean and quality water to reduce their susceptibility to the COVID-19 disease and other waterborne illnesses. The Executive Secretary of the Commission, Mrs Funke Adepoju gave the advice today while speaking on the need for all residents to be safe during this period and also guide against avoidable deaths and diseases as a result of ignorance. She said that it is important for Lagosians to practice basic hygiene as already being advocated since the discovery of the index case of the COVID-19 in the country, stressing that the precautionary measures must be strictly observed to reduce the number of hospital patients during this period. While acknowledging the cases of shortage of water supply in some parts of the State, Adepoju advocated for conservation and effective usage of water, especially in a situation where water is scarce. In her words, “Lagosians should use clean water, preferably running tap. They should never recycle water for hand wash. It must also be stressed that joint hand wash in a bowl or even under a running tap or washing their hands in water used by someone else should be avoided”.
