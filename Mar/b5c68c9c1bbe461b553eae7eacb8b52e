Ishiaku Onatunde, a slaughterhouse worker, said the fence fell its foundation was  weak. “Ideally, the government should have constructed the fence on a strong foundation knowing that we use a lot of water in our daily routine as slaughterers,” he said. Onatunde said that the workers of the slaughterhouse had  met with the management of the abattoir, Harmony Abattoir Investment Limited, to ask for compensation for the victims  of the collapsed fence.
