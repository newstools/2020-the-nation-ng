My mom called me and said ‘Lizzie I don’t feel good, Rita don’t feel good, Tony don’t feel good. Can you come help us?’ I said absolutely ma. “It’s like the second we start to grieve about one the phone rings and there’s another person gone, taken from us forever. “By the time it settled in our brains about my first sister we got the next call [and] I listened to those doctors and those machines code my mother on the phone when she passed last night [Wednesday]. “I’ll never get over that but I never wanna hear that again. That’s why we are just begging for help. We never wanna get that call anytime soon ever again because of this. We’re lost.”
