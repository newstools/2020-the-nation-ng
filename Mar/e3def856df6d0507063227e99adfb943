 AKWA Ibom State Commissioner for Health, Dr. Dominic Ukpong, on Friday dispelled the widely circulated rumour that some allegedly infected Chinese nationals had brought the killer disease into the state. The rumour had generated fear and tension in the state, causing people to avoid public gatherings even as they started avoiding handshakes and physical contacts. However, despite the earlier panic the state government has not ordered the closure of schools and prohibition of religious gatherings of more than 50 persons as it is in other states in the country. Addressing a press conference in his office in Uyo, Ukpong, flanked by officials of his ministry, said: “You may have read a rash of misinformation and outright mischief peddled by certain individuals which went viral on the social media platforms about the status of the coronavirus in Akwa lbom State. “I want to assure the public that rumours and false information going around social media about some Chinese and coronavirus in Akwa lbom State is completely false. “For emphasis, let me state here categorically and unambiguously, that there is no confirmed case of Covid-19 infection in Akwa lbom State as I speak to you.” The health commissioner said the state governor, Udom Emmanuel, had weeks ago given him and the staff of his ministry the marching order to be on top of the issue. “As a proactive government, even before the first confirmed case in Nigeria was reported, Akwa lbom State Government had, through the Ministry of Health, initiated measures to prevent the outbreak and contain the infection in the event of an outbreak in Akwa lbom State,” he said.
