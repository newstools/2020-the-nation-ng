The Lagos State Commissioner for Health, Prof Akin Abayomi, has said the Italian who brought Coronavirus to Nigeria is still potentially contagious and will remain in isolation at the Infectious Disease Hospital, Yaba, until he no longer secretes the virus. Abayomi during a briefing earlier today said the Italian was recuperating  and in a stable condition he will continue to remain in isolation until he is no longer poses a health risk to other members of the community. “The Italian has continued to remain in excellent form; our last test on Monday shows he is still potentially contagious. We are going to do more tests. The global practice is to conduct two negative tests 48 hours apart before releasing the Coronavirus patient” “We are still going to test the secretion from his lungs and urine to make sure he does not have any virus from his secretion. As soon as he is negative, we will discharge him. “The secondary case first tested positive and later tested negative, he has been discharged yesterday (Monday) morning as he has recovered from the virus,” the commissioner pointed out.
