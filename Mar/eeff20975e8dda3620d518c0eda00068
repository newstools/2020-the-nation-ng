Juventus and Argentina forward Paulo Dybala has tested positive for coronavirus. The Juventus striker declared his diagnosis in a tweet, saying he and his partner, singer Oriana Sabatini tested positive for COVID-19 but are doing well. He is the third Juve player to be confirmed to have the virus, following centre-back Daniele Rugani and France World Cup winner Blaise Matuidi.  “Both Oriana and I have tested positive,” Dybala, 26, said. “Luckily we are in perfect conditions.” “Thanks for your messages.” Dybala’s girlfriend Oriana Sabatini – an Argentine singer, actress and model – is the niece of former tennis player Gabriela Sabatini, the 1990 US Open champion.
