A renowned property merchant, Sir Olu Okeowo, is set to join the growing number of privileged individuals complementing the efforts of the governments across the country to lessen the burdens of the citizens over the COVID-19 pandemic. Okeowo, through his foundation, Sir Olu Okeowo Foundation, has launched a food bank where 100, 000 people will be given assorted foodstuff and other items towards alleviating the hunger in Lagos State. The distribution venues, according to the Foundation, are on the Island and Mainland. The foundation further urged residents to call on it so it can extend the gesture to any identifiable flashpoint of hunger as well as ways of distribution without violating any health standards and regulations.
