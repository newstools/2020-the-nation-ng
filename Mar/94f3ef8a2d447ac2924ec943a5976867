The daughter of President Muhammadu Buhari, who returned from the United Kingdom (UK) on Wednesday, has gone into self-isolation. First Lady, Hajia Aisha Buhari, revealed this in a thread of tweets on her verified Tweeter handle, @aishambuhari. The First Lady clarified that her daughter’s self-isolation was not because she had displayed any symptom identifiable with Coronavirus (COVID-19), but a safeguard measure. The First Lady, who used the tweets to encourage Nigerians to be self-conscious and  avoid exposure  to the spiraling pandemic, said she had already shut her office down for two weeks. The tweets read: “Good afternoon Nigerians, early today (Thursday) my daughter returned from the UK being among the high burden-listed countries of COVID-19. “Based on the advice of the Hon. Minister of Health , Presidential Task force on COVID – 19 and that of NCDC (National Center for Disease Control), she is on self Isolation, not because she displayed any symptoms of COVID-19.. “Please, I urge all parents to do the same if possible as prevention is better than cure . “Similarly, I have shut down my office for two weeks with immediate effect while essential staff can work from home as a result of some staff who recently returned from the UK . “I commend the Northwest governors,  Niger and Kwara  state governments on preventive measures taken to curb the spread of COVID-19 at their security meeting yesterday in Kaduna. “Let’s keep following the advice of the Federal Ministry of Health and the NCDC, which encourages maintaining social distancing and  high hygiene culture through regular washing of hands with soaps and sanitisers. “Let’s adopt preventive measures and ensure the safety of our families and that of general public. “We will overcome the Covid-19 pandemic if we all take the necessary precautions at the same time.”
