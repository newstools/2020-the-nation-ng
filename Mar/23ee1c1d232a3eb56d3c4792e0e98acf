The dethroned Emir of Kano, Muhammad Sanusi, has stated that God approved his removal from the throne by Kano state government. He stated this in Awe while leading Friday Muslim prayers at the palace of the Emir of Awe with the Kaduna Governor Nasir El’Rufai in attendance. Sanusi, during the prayers, urged Muslim faithful to always obey God and accept his judgement in whatever happens. He stated that whatever happens to anyone of them is destined by God, if not there is no way it would happen. He explained that there is no way anything that God has not destined would come to pass. He underscored the needs for Nigerians to also continue to pray for peace and progress of the country. The dethroned Emir also urged Muslims to fear God in all their activities, reminding them they must give account of his or her deeds hereafter. El-Rufai, who was in Awe to visit the dethroned Emir, arrived the Emir’s residence at about 12:45pm. He was received by the dethroned emir where they quickly went into a closed- door meeting after which they drove straight to Friday mosque. Our correspondent gathered that it was the first time Sanusi was allowed to make a public speech after he was dethroned by the Kano State Government and banished to Nasarawa State. There was heavy security presence  during the prayer as armed policemen and other security personnel were deployed.
