  Three persons suspected to be hired thugs have been arrested with guns by irate youths of Nawfia community, Njikoka Local Government Area of Anambra State while excavating sand in the community land. Spokesman of the youths, Francis Onwubekwe, told newsmen weekend that the suspects were nine altogether, adding a gun was recovered from one of them before they were handed over to the SARS. He said, “On Friday, we got a tip-off that some thugs employed by one of our own, entered our community land called, Agu Uruoji, and started excavating the sand despite a court order that nobody should tresspass on the land. “As we got to the land the thugs started attacking us and we fought back and overpowered them. We arrested two with gun on the spot while others ran away.  “We later arrested the third person, our own son, Charles Okonkwo, their leader and they are presently cooling off at SARS Awkuzu.” Reacting, Traditional Ruler of Nawfia community, Igwe Chijioke Nwankwo, urged the police to ensure the suspects were prosecuted to serve as deterrent to would-be offenders. He said one of the suspects was recently shot dead by the police while robbing motorists along Onitsha-Enugu expressway. “They were thugs hired by a son of the community and armed to threaten the people,” Nwankwo said. Police Spokesperson, Haruna Mohammed said he was yet to be briefed. “I’m not aware of the arrest but will check and get back to you please,” he said.
