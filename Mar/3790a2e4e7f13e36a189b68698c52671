It was a full moment of bliss for students, heads of school, teachers and parents recently at the Lagos State University (LASU) Stadium in Ojo Lagos, as Solid Steps International School had its first inter-house sport. The school proprietress, Juliana Okpor, disclosed that the motive that attracted the school to sport is the proverb that says “all work no play makes Jack a dull boy”. It was all fun, dance and speech-making day with teachers seeing the glory of their wards on solid steps to life. Okpor expressed her determination in impacting modern day teaching aids and technology to a generation of young people who are thinkers, inquirers, articulate and confident to take to the world stage in academy and sport. “Solid Step International School with branches at Governors Road and College terminals in Ikotun was basically planted to see to the future right moulding for pupils and students by helping them to make bold steps into success through needed educational training and sport,” she said. At the tail end of the event, the Green House finished first, Yellow House came second and the Blue House finished third.
