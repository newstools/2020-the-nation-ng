Our Reporter  ODION IGHALO also expects a ‘tough’ game when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men tackle Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City in the Premier League derby tomorrow at the Old Trafford. “It is going to be a tough game because derby game is always tough,” the 30-year-old Nigerian striker who scored a brace in the 3-0 win over Derby on Thursday told Viaplay Football. “This is the first derby I am going to play, so we are working hard and we have to correct every mistake we made against Derby County. “We cannot afford to repeat them (mistakes) against Man City tomorrow, and so we are going to work hard from in today’s training and get ready for the game.” Meanwhile, the Nigerian striker is looking forward to playing in Wembley after featuring for Watford in their 2-1 semi-final loss to Crystal Palace in 2016 FA Cup.  Despite that defeat denying him his dream of coming up against Louis van Gaal’s side in the showpiece event, he has good memories of stepping out at Wembley Stadium and wants to repeat the feat later in the season. “That was my first time playing in Wembley, it was a great experience,” Ighalo said. “United got to the final that year, I remember because I was hoping we would win Crystal Palace so we could play against Man United in the final. “That dream did not come to pass but it’s a great experience, you know. Playing in Wembley, not every player has the opportunity to play in Wembley in their career. You have to play in a cup game, a cup final or play for the national team to play there. “I had the opportunity to play for Watford there in the semi-final, so it was a great experience and I’m looking forward, hopefully, to be playing there again.”
