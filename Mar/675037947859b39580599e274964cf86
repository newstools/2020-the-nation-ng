The Nigeria Immigration Service has suspended the processing of passport and migrant e-Registration across its offices. This was due to the current outbreak and spread of COVID-19, which has become a global issue that deserves urgent attention and approach. The Comptroller General of Immigration Service, Muhammad Babandede, disclosed this in a statement by Mr Sunday James, the Service Public Relations Officer, on Monday in Abuja. “The service has accordingly directed for the temporary suspension of processing of passport and Migrant e-Registration effective 23rd March – 23rd April, 2020 in line with government’s directives on Restrictions on International Flight.” Babandede said that the Service would use the period to process all pending passport cases, adding that the public would be informed when they are ready for collection. He added that the Service regrets any inconvenience caused the public within this period and assured Nigerians of its continued service delivery.
