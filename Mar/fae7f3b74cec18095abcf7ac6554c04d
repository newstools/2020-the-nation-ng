Justice Ahmed Mohammed, in a ruling on March 3, 2020, an enrolled copy of which The Nation obtained yesterday in Abuja, granted leave for the applicants – Incorporated Trustees of Kingdom Human Rights Foundation International and Rights for All International – to proceed with their matter. Justice Mohammed ordered the applicants to serve a copy of the order granting them leave and other substantive documents in the suit on the defendants. The judge adjourned till March 17 this year for hearing. Named as defendants are: the Economic and Finanacial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Okorocha, Zigreat International Company Limited, Eze Stanley Enwereku and Duru Cyriacus Onyeobi. The plaintiffs, who filed the suit through their lawyer K. M. Okere, are seeking to compel the EFCC to investigate Okorocha and others over sundry allegations of financial impropriety while in office.
