 ENGLAND teenager Jadon Sancho scored in a seventh consecutive home Bundesliga appearance as Borussia Dortmund beat Freiburg. Only Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang – now at Arsenal – has ever had a longer run for the club, with 11 home goals in a row. Sancho tapped home Thorgan Hazard’s cross from six yards out for the game’s only goal. The 19-year-old winger has now scored 14 goals and assisted another 14 in the league this season. Dortmund remain third, four points behind leaders Bayern Munich. In-form Erling Braut Haaland came on in the 63rd minute and failed to score in a home league match for the first time since September 2018 when his Molde side lost to Rosenborg in Norway’s top flight.
