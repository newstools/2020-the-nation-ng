 The Nigerian Electricity Regulation Commission (NERC) has said 17 deaths and eight injuries of various degrees involving employees, companies and third parties were recorded in third quarter of 2019. NERC stated this in its third quarter report made available on its website. The report said the commission received a total of 104 accident reports from the licensed operators during the third quarter of 2019. “The accidents, however, resulted to 17 deaths and eight injuries of various degrees involving both employees of the companies and the third parties. “In comparison to the second quarter of 2019 when 37 deaths and 18 injuries were recorded, there was a significant improvement in the health and safety performance of the operators in the third quarter of 2019. “In line with its mandate to ensure safe and reliable electricity services, the commission has commenced enforcement on some of the incidence involving various safety breaches during the third quarter,” it said. According to the report, the Commission is also developing a comprehensive penalty and compensation structure for health and safety breaches in Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI). It said the structure would stop the utilities’ discretionary payment of compensations to electrical accident victims or their families. “On account of the commission’s stand for zero tolerance on safety breaches in NESI and in line with its strategic goals 2017-2020, the Commission has intensified its monitoring and implementation of various safety programmes,” it said. According to the Commission, the safety programmes are aimed at reducing accidents in the power sector. It listed the safety programmes being implemented to include the standardisation of system protection schemes, and engagement of stakeholders on Right of Way (RoW) violation. Others are public enlightenment on the safe use of electricity and a review of an operational procedure for Distribution System Operators (DSO) on fault clearing.
