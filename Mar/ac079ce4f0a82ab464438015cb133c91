 SUSPECTED kidnappers have killed a retired soldier and kidnapped four others including an expectant mother in Kaduna, The Nation has learnt. It was gathered that the gunmen stormed Mahuta community, a suburb of Kaduna metropolis, in the early hours of yesterday and whisked away their victims in commando style. This is the second time in  five months that kidnappers have invaded Mahuta community. The first time was in November 2019, when two siblings, both lecturers, were kidnapped and a huge amount of money and a motorcycle were collected as ransom. In the latest incident, The Nation learnt that the expectant mother among those kidnapped was later abandoned in the bush due to her inability to walk. Police spokesman ASP Muhammad Jalige said he had no details of the incident at the time of filing the report. A source in the community said, “Whem the bandits came shooting, the old soldier  came out to see what was happening. They followed him into his house and killed him.”
