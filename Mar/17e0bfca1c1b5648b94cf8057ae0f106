Lagos State House of Assembly on Thursday urged Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to set up fire service stations in all the 57 council areas as part of measures to check fire disasters. The House also resolved that the governor should direct the Commissioner for Special Duties, Seye Oladejo, to ensure that all public and private institutions have functioning fire extinguishers in their premises. Akeem Shokunle (Oshodi-Isolo I), who moved the motion during plenary, said incidences of fire disasters were too frequent in the state. He said there was the need for drastic measures to curtail it. Shokunle said: “There have been incidents of fire disasters in the state. The government has expended huge amounts of money on every occurrence. “The House, therefore, calls on the State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu to direct the ministry of Special Duties to carry out sensitisation on inherent dangers in the failure to have fire extinguishers in schools, markets and others.”
