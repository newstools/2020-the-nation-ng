Zamfara State governor Bello Matawalle has said that his government has resolved with the military to resume attacks on unrepentant bandits in the state. This was contained in a statement signed by Zailni Bappa, Special Adviser to the governor on Public Enlightenment. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), reports that there has been a resurgence of armed banditry in the state in the last two months. According to him, the fire power which had already taken effect in the state had started yielding positive results. On Tuesday 14 persons including a districtÂ  head kidnapped on March 21 were freed. The resumption of military offensive became necessary after some bandits refused to leverage the window of opportunity for them to give up their unlawful business.
