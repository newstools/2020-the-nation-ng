Blessing Olaifa, Abuja  The Federal Government on Thursday created digital platforms for interactions and conferences among Ministries, Departments and government agencies. The Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Ali Pantami said the platforms were created as part of measures for social distancing and a necessary precaution to curtail the spread of coronavirus in the country. Dr Pantami said: “With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is highly recommended to exercise measures such as social distancing as a necessary precaution towards curbing the spread of the deadly and highly infectious virus.” With the disease known to spread primarily through contact with infected persons, surfaces or environments, there is a need for civil servants and the workforce in the country to minimize physical and face-to-face meetings, the Minister added. In a statement signed by the Minister’s media aide, Uwa Suleiman, Dr Pantami, therefore, encouraged MDAs and civil servants to use the Federal Government’s Unified Communication Services (UCS) platform available to provide reliable and secure audio and video communication within the 1Gov network. The Minister said: “The Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy through its parastatal Galaxy Backbone has provided video conferencing, telepresence and video IP phone facilities in most MDAs within its Abuja metro Fiber network, to provide a smart means of communication and collaboration within the public sector. “Platforms available to minimize the need for physical meetings while performing the day to day functions of government are: ” IP Voice and Video Telephony Services: About 16,000 unit have been deployed to provide users secure free voice & video communications over Galaxy’s network using physical handsets and software-based endpoints; and ” Video Conferencing/ telepresence Services: About 120 terminals hav been deployed to provide real-time video conferencing for users to meet and collaborate with colleagues and partners across various locations nationwide and internationally. “The Honourable Minister, therefore, calls on all MDAs and public officers that have these services deployed to use them by hosting remote meetings and conferences which will help limit the spread of the virus.”
