He added that the development of skills and workforce productivity is however critical to maximise the country’s large working populations, regrettably the greater percentage of this workforce is not engage because of the absent of requisite skills Speaking, the Director-General, Industrial Training Fund, (ITF) Joseph Ari said as organisation responsible for the development of the poor and the disadvantaged in our society as they are viewed as dirty, dreaded and dangerous. This perception has led to skills shortages in trades and vocational areas that Nigerians should be well equipped to perform. “My opinion finds support from a Skills Gap Survey in Six Priority Sectors of the Nigerian Economy that was conducted by the Industrial Training Fund (ITF) in liaison with the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO), which showed that despite rising unemployment, vacancies still existed in several sectors of the economy that are still reliant on foreign labour to be filled. “My understanding of this is that if over 20 million Nigerians are not employed and yet technicians are imported, the answer can only be that Nigerians have not fully embraced skills acquisition as a sustainable alternative to white collar jobs. This mindset and the perception that hands-on skills are for a certain group of Nigerians has to change,” Ari said. He said there were several other knotty problems highlighting the enormity of the hurdles confronting the entrenchment of skills acquisition culture in the country.
