 FOLLOWING complaints about the continuous presence of beggars in Niger State despite a ban, the state government has given beggars two weeks to leave the state or face prosecution. Commissioner of Information and Strategy, Alhaji Muhammad Sani Idris said the government is constituting a task force to ensure strict compliance to the ban on street begging. He said it would take about two weeks for the task force to begin its work, adding that the beggars have the grace of this period to leave the state. Idris said that the state would not become a dumping ground for beggars, adding that the ban would go further to safeguard the state from unscrupulous elements. He, however, said that the ban on begging does not mean a ban on the Almajiri system, stating that the Almajiri system does not mean children would go out to beg under any guise.
