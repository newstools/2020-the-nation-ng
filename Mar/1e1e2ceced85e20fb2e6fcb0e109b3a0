The only thing that may give an indication is her full name – but she is often addressed as Mrs. Akeredolu. Betty, who is cancer survivor, married Governor Rotimi Akeredolu 40 years ago and the union is blessed with four children. Social Circuit gathered that the couple met during their compulsory National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) scheme at a friend’s house in Enugu. The insider explained, “The governor accompanied his friend who visited his girlfriend and the rest is history. I think, for them, it was love at first sight because everything was so smooth. Even though the wife is three years older than her husband, she has always respected him. When they met, she was 25-year-old while he was 22-year-old But they respect and love each other a lot.”
