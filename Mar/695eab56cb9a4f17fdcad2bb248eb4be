In light of the rapid spread of COVID-19 around the world, the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) has decided to suspend all activities provisionally until the end of April 2020. Following the declaration by the World Health Organization of COVID-19 as a pandemic and the increased number of international travel restrictions, the ITTF has decided to suspend all activities provisionally, with the health and safety of athletes, coaches, officials and fans as the top priority. The suspension comes into effect from today, March 16, 2020 and relates to all ITTF sanctioned events, High Performance and Development activities and ITTF Foundation activities that had been due to start between the above date and the end of April 2020. The ITTF Executive Committee will hold an emergency meeting today to discuss the situation further and an announcement will be made next week regarding the ITTF World Tour Hong Kong and China Opens. The ITTF has also recommended to all Continental Associations to follow the ITTF’s decision. Also, the African Table Tennis Federation (ATTF) has postponed next month’s African Junior and Cadet Championships holding in Madagascar over the Coronavirus pandemic.
