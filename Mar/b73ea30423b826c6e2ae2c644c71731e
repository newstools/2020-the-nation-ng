Hours after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered pubs, bars, cafes and restaurants closed as part of the effort to check the spread of the coronavirus, Britons have stripped alcohol aisles bare in major supermarkets and stores. The alcohol aisles in several stores were conspicuously empty on Saturday, the morning after the Prime Minister ordered the closure. Social media users were quick to splash pictures of the empty alcohol aisles on Twitter and Facebook. Shoppers were also unrelenting in stocking up food items, toilet rolls and other essential items despite warnings from the government to stop panic buying amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Reports said booze has replaced toilet paper as the number one must-have product for customers.
