Worried by the spate of insecurity in the country, followers of the Brotherhood of the Cross and Star, religious movement otherwise known as ‘Olumba Olumba’ have converged on Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) for a national peace march slated for Saturday, March 14. The spokesman of the religious movement, Mr. Edet Achibong told newsmen during a briefing that the march is part of a weeklong programme of the organization tagged “Abuja 2020”. Achibong said: “an estimated number of about five thousand participants from Africa, Europe, North America, The Caribbean, South America and Asia will be attending. He added that: “With the menace of insurgency, kidnappings, armed robbery, inter-tribal wars and a host of other security concerns, most Nigerians are yearning for peace which will come from the eradication of these societal challenges. “The Abuja Evangelical Peace March is aimed at seeking the face of God to instill peace in the entire Nigeria. “And to draw the attention of Nigerians to the fact that, the giver of peace is physically in Nigeria. “Though God is present with us here, we have to identify him and present our problems before him to obtain the needed solutions”. The religious body also preached peace and love as the only solution to the challenges facing the country. He said: “The way out is to practice the teachings on love brought by the Holy Spirit Personified, Leader Olumba Olumba Obu and to surrender all thrones and dominions, for the owner of the world and Giver of peace has arrived”. It also warned that for Nigeria to move forward: “Religious and ethnic bigotry, ethnic sentiments and discrimination should be done away with. “We should have love for one another irrespective of religion, ethnicity, social status or gender. “If we have love for one another there will be no stealing, no kidnappings, no defrauding, no killings, no embezzlement of funds and no favouritism, in fact all vices will disappear.”
