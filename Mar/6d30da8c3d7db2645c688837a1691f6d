An Ilorin, Kwara state based private tertiary institution, Al-hikmah University management has warned its new students not to attend any ‘unholy gathering’ during their stay in the institution. Management specifically, cautioned “any student from attending a fresher’s night being put together by some useless elements,” it was gathered. The university added that it was aware of a surreptitious move by some people to organize what it called fresher’s night, warning that “any student caught attending the party will be summarily expelled from the institution.” This came as the institution matriculated no fewer than 905 students for the 2019/2020 academic session. Addressing the new in-takes, Vice Chancellor of the university, Prof Taofeek Ibrahim said that the institution had made giant stride in all fronts. Prof Ibrahim revealed that Al-hikmah University came sixth of the 78 universities sampled by the National Universities Commission (NUC) Assessment of Students Support Service. He added that the student population of the school had grown from 3,000 in 2015 to 5,000 with 18 departments and 169 academic programmes. Prof Ibrahin admonished the students to be good ambassadors of the institution, families and country wherever they found themselves. He counseled the students to shun all cultism and all forms of antisocial behaviour. “I urge you all to make judicious use of your time. And wait for your time too. It is about what you make of yourselves now that will determine the service you will give to Nigeria tomorrow. I charge you all to remain humble. It is the most valued treasure you will need to succeed in life,” he said.
