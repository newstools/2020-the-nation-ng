 Leader of Ohaneze Ndigbo, Lagos State chapter, Solomon Ogbonna Aguene, is happy about the enterprising nature of his people in the state. Recently, he took time to advise them on the need to insure their business against unforeseen circumstances especially the recent fire outbreaks which destroyed goods worth millions of naira. The impact of Nigerian traders within and outside the shores of the country over the years has been remarkable, according to Aguene, who is also a businessman. He declared that there is need to re-strategise in order to take their businesses to the next level. “They are very hard working and enterprising. They have put a lot of hard work into what they are doing and I am very proud of them. However, there have been a number of challenges that I have noticed since the beginning of the year. So, I would want to encourage them to continue to put in their best and not be discouraged.” One of the recent challenges is the fire outbreak in different markets and you can imagine the impact on their businesses.” The fire incident was awful, very bad, a lot of the traders lost goods worth millions of naira. Thank God, no life was lost in the incident. It is quite unfortunate and I sympathise with the affected traders,” stated Aguene. Aguene pleaded with Lagos State government and wealthy people to assist the traders in rebuilding their businesses as they pick up the pieces. “Fire outbreak just like every accidental event is unpredictable. However, it is important for us to always take measures to stem or avert such events, especially when traced to human error. We learnt that the fire was ignited while somebody was refuelling a running electric generator. It is unfortunate, and I hope people would avoid refuelling generators on operation. Even in our homes, we should turn off the generators before refuelling. If possible, allow the generator to cool before refuelling,” advised the businessman.
