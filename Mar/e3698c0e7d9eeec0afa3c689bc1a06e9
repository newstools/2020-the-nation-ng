Office of Education Quality Assurance (OEQA) has intensified its monitoring and compliance drive to ensure that all schools shut down to curtail the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19). Addressing newsmen during the exercise, the Director-General, OEQA, Mrs Abiola Seriki-Ayeni said the exercise, being done simultaneously across the state, was meant to ensure that all schools are closed following the directives of Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu. Seriki-Ayeni averred that while the majority of schools complied with the order, it was discovered that some boarding schools still had students awaiting their parents to pick them up. ”A few schools, especially some boarding schools have had issues with getting students to leave their premises or have not done a good job at communicating the emergency to parents”. “We have also noticed that other schools deliberately did not comply, as their students were still on campus taking examinations, but necessary actions have been taken against them”, she added. The Director-General expressed optimism that there will be total compliance by schools within a few days, emphasising the importance of continued sensitisation campaigns through the various social media handles, radio and television. The schools visited by the Director-General’s team include Vivian Fowler Memorial College for Girls, Oregun-Ikeja; Chrisland Schools, Opebi-Ikeja; Maryland Comprehensive Secondary school, Maryland; Jeco College and Homat Pivotal Schools both in Ikorodu area of the State.
