The Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, has said that Nigeria will not be given due recognition by other sporting nations if nothing is done to address the deficit in sports infrastructure in the country. The minister made this assertion in a chat with a team from the Bureau of Public Enterprises in his office in Abuja. He explained that the country is losing relevance in sporting activities as far as the world is concerned, missing out on hosting international events and will continue to do so if nothing is done. “We have lost two major international events this year as a result of this,”  declared Dare. “There must be deliberate efforts from public and private organisations to ensure there is timely intervention about the stadia the country. “This business model around sports can help to achieve the desired goal of sports in the country. When there are no good stadia, you can’t attract the investors. The investors need good infrastructure to enable them to market their product too.” The minister, who noted that the only good international stadium in Nigeria is in Uyo, added that concerted efforts were being made to upgrade some stadia in the country with the help of public spirited individuals and organisations.
