Worried by the incessant security challenges in the country, the Nigerian Communications Commission, (NCC) has collaborated with the security operatives to nab kidnappers and others who use SIM cards for wrong purposes. The Executive Vice Chairman of the commission, Professor Umar Danbatta made this known while speaking at the 41st Kaduna International Trade Fair organized by the Kaduna Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture, (KADCCIMA). The Executive Vice Chairman was represented by the Director Zonal Services, Hajia Amina Shehu at the event. O what NCC is doing to apprehend kidnappers using phone calls to demand ransom after kidnapping, she said: “NCC as a regulator is doing so much with the regards to security of lives of all Nigerians. “One of the fundamental things we are doing to nab all this evil perpetrators is to ensure that your SIM cards are captured and registered. “We also understand that there are those who evade the registration of sim cards. As a result of this, we have department in the organization, called a Code Compliance Monitoring and Enforcement department, responsible for making sure that people who registered wrongly or particularly with an intent to perpetrate evil act are apprehended. Once we get hold of them, we do the needful. We work in partnership with security operatives to be able to nab some of the people who registered wrongly.” Mrs Shehu assured telecommunications consumers of better services to improve their businesses, saying the NCC as a National Telecom Regulator is a consumer-centric organisation, poised to developing Consumer Protection initiatives like Complaint Channels. “We have developed the Do-Not-Disturb Code to stop all unsolicited messages, the Mobile Number Portability to enable changing from one service provider without changing ones’ mobile number.” He said.
