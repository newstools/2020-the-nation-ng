FOLLOWING recent exploits of Grange School at the 2020 World School Games in Dubai, Chairperson of  School’s Parents-Teachers Association (PTA) in Lagos State, Tairat Tijani, has urged curriculum experts to ensure sport gets its rightful place in the school system. Tijani said quite a number of schools were  not structured to encourage sporting activities, adding parents should support their wards with latent sporting skills. “I think the school curriculum has to change in order to change the mind-set of many people about sports and so that pupils can be identified and realize their potential in sports. Also, there must be recognition for schools doing well in sports,” she said. She also noted that schools were becoming more aware of the opportunity in sports especially with regards to overseas scholarship and are now beginning to implement better sporting activities. The PTA chairperson stressed that sport has great potential for pupils as it could spur them to success in other spheres of life. She explained: “There is something unique about successful people. They try and fail several times but they never ever give up. You can’t teach someone that but he or she must experience same to have an appreciation for what it takes to succeed. Sports teach you not to be complacent and not to give up.”
