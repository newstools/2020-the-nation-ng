 There was pandemonium in Lapai community as a tanker heading towards Bida from Abuja road knocked  down a man that the locals simply identified as Babangida, and critically injured two others, one of who is a student of Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University Lapai (IBBUL), Niger State. An eye witness who craved anonymity, recounted the scenario to CAMPUSLIFE. He said: “The driver of the trailer was reckless on the wheels. Sighting a bump ahead of him, he suddenly applied the brakes at breakneck speed, but the trailer skidded off the road and ran into people standing by the roadside, killing Babangida, and injuring several others.’’ CAMPUSLIFE gathered that one of the injured persons was a final year student of English Department, while the other is yet to be identified as at press time. According to a source, the student, who was initially taken to Lapai General Hospital, has been transferred to Minna General Hospital in the state capital due to severity of their condition. Meanwhile, the Chairman of Lapai Local Government Area of Niger State, Jantabo Amidu, has ordered the demolition of roadside shops as a means of reducing incessant road mishaps on Abuja-Bida road.
