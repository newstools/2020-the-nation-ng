 THERE was a rush by Lagos residents on Monday to stock their homes with food items as the lockdown begins today. There were long queues at various Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) monitored by our correspondents, with many frustrated by their inefficiency. Traders took advantage of the situation at hand to increase the prices of goods. A tuber of yam which sold for N300 last Tuesday has risen to N1,300. The Nation saw a woman negotiating a tuber of yam for N1,500, whereas the seller put N1,800 price tag on it. Two smaller tubers of yam were sold for N2,700. A woman said she bought a bag of Garri at Ipaja market for N12,000. According to her, the same bag of Garri was priced at N3,800 last Thursday. A medical practitioner, Dr Monsurat Kadri, said the lockdown destabilised her. Dr Kadri, who owns a medical centre in Ojodu, lamented that there will be difficulties. She said: “I need to think of how to keep the practice running knowing fully well that most of my staff are not mobile.” Vice-Chairman of Itire-Ikate LCDA Pastor Gbenga Oyebode said: “We have all known that it will get to this stage, so we are prepared by saving towards now.” Pastor Oyebode, who is the Chairman of Lagos State Association of Council Vice Chairmen (LASACVIC), said the Lockdown is long overdue. “If we have taken this decision a month ago, we will not be at this stage,” he said.
