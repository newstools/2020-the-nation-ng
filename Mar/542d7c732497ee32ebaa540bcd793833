Market leaders in Anambra State have threatened to close any market in the state that refused to comply with the directives on measures to prevent further spread of the coronavirus pandemic. President General, Anambra State Market Amalgamated Traders’ Association (ASMATA) Ikechukwu Ekwegbalu gave the warning in a statement on Wednesday titled “Directive from the State Government” and copied market chairmen and secretaries. He said all markets must as a matter of urgency provide hand washing centres with water, soap and sanitizer placed centrally for all to use. He said, “All lines in the markets must immediately place water, soap and sanitiser at the entrance of their lines and must encourage every customer to use same before entering the line. “Every shop in all the markets must provide buckets of water and soap with sanitisers and must encourage customers to use them. “Your phone is something you use most often. Please, endeavour to cleanse it with mild sanitiser like baby wipe. “Non-compliance to this directive will lead to the closure of the defaulting markets,” Ekwegbalu said, hinting that the state government had contemplated total closure of the markets, but had to resconsider the decision following appeal by the market leadership.
