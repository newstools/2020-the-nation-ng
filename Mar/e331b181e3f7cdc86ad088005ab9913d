 THE Lagos State Government says it will intensify the creation of awareness among residents on the devastating consequences of kidney disease. The governor’s wife, Mrs Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu, said this yesterday  during the commemoration of the World Kidney Day 2020. The theme of the commemoration is: ‘’Chronic Kidney Disease: Stop the Epidemic in Africa (Kidney Health for Everyone Everywhere)’’.  It was organised by the Kidney Foundation for Africa in Lagos. Sanwo-Olu said that kidney disease was widely acknowledged to be a major terminator of precious lives, hence, the need for the  government to intensify awareness. She said that hospital-based findings revealed that about 13 per cent of Nigeria’s population suffered from Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), which was capable of leading to kidney failure,  resulting in death. According to her, “this percentage does not include patients who lack access to hospital care. ‘’However, available data from the World Health Organisation (WHO) equally shows that about 2 million people in Lagos State are suffering from CKD. ‘’For the administration of Governor Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu, this is not acceptable and concerted efforts are being made to create awareness on the causes of the disease and the prevention methods to adopt to nip it in the bud and stop it from afflicting the people. ‘’The health and well-being of residents is paramount to this administration as aptly demonstrated in the Health and Environment component of the T.H.E.M.E.S agenda. ‘’The agenda is the policy thrust of Mr Governor’s vision for Traffic Management and Transportation; Health and Environment; Education and Technology; Making Lagos a 21st Century Economy; Entertainment and Tourism; as well as Security and Governance,’’ she said.
