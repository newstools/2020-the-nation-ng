  Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has yet given a clear indication that the club could make Odion Ighalo’s loan move from Shanghai Shenhua permanent. Speaking a day after the Nigerian striker struck a wonder goal in the club’s 5-0 thrashing of LASK in the Europa League, Solskjaer said Ighalo’s  has been a great addition to the club, adding his likeable personality has endeared him to the rank and file of Old Trafford. He said: “Odion has done really well since he came in and he’s enjoying himself. “And he will improve and get better but he has qualities we saw in him and we needed and we will still need those qualities for next season, so let’s see what we will do. “He’s a goal scorer and a striker, he doesn’t worry too much about all that nonsense; build-up play – that’s a joke, obviously. “He knows his job and what his role in the team is, and he’s very good with his back to goal, great link player, but maybe the best thing about him is his personality, so he’s got the whole lot really,” he said. Meanwhile, Ighalo has been included in the UEFA Europa League first leg round of 16 Team of the Week, following his impressive performance for his club against LASK. The Europa Team of the Week was announced on UEFA’s official website yesterday. Ighalo was included as a result of his superb goal which put United 1-0 up in the game which ended 5-0. After receiving a pass from Bruno Fernandes Ighalo juggled the ball twice in front of his marker before volleying a left-foot strike into the top corner. He also provided the assist for United’s second goal scored by Daniel James. Other United players who made the Europa list with Ighalo are Fred, Eric Bailly, Luke Shaw, Brandon Williams and James. It was Ighalo’s third goal in his third start for United and has now scored four goals in eight games in all competitions.
