Billionaire reality star and businesswoman Kylie Jenner, 22, is reportedly bankrolling her broke older brother Rob Kardashian. Rob, 32, has been shying away from the limelight for years now, dropping out of family reality show Keeping Up With The Kardashians and living away from the spotlight. But now, it’s said that his bills are spiraling so far out of control that he’s having to turn to his rich sister Kylie, 22, for some much-needed cash. A source: “He’s taken so much off his mom and Khloe over the years, so it’s been agreed far and wide that it’s Kylie’s turn to help Rob out.” The whole famous family is said to be reunited in helping Rob financially, but that it’s not just out of the goodness of their hearts. The insider added: “Everyone’s united in helping him get full custody of Dream, if only to stick it to Blac Chyna, whom they all loathe with a passion.” As it’s been reported already, Rob and Chyna, 31, are locked in a bitter custody battle over their three-year-old daughter Dream. Court documents filed on January 7 stated that the concerned dad had asked a judge for full custody. Rob also accused Chyna – real name Angela White – of spending £450 a day on alcohol, or abusing drugs and failing to keep their daughter well-presented. But she reportedly hit back at everything he was saying. Rob and Chyna got together in January 2016 and announced their shock engagement just three months later. Their relationship and her pregnancy was captured on their own reality series Rob & Chyna. But they split just one month after welcoming their daughter.
