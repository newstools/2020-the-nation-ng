 The League Management Company (LMC) has imposed sanctions on Wikki Tourists and Adamawa United for breach of some sections of the rules of the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) during their respective home games on Matchday 23 on Sunday. The LMC, in a release, said Wikki Tourists which hosted Plateau United in Bauchi were punished for failure to ensure adequate and effective crowd control when there was a clash among sections of supporters, which caused a delay in the match, violating Rule B13.52.1 of the rules of the NPFL. The LMC, thereby, levied a fine of N1, 500,000, to be paid by the club within 10 working days. Similarly, Adamawa United which hosted Warri Wolves in Gombe were penalized for the offence committed by some of their supporters for breaching security and harassed match officials, which resulted in the discontinuation of the match and having to be concluded the following day at a different venue (Bauchi) and with a different set of match officials.  For the offence, the LMC in exercise of summary jurisdiction imposed a total fine of N5, 000,000 to be paid within ten working days. The LMC also ordered that subsequent minimum of three consecutive home matches of Adamawa United shall be played behind closed doors. The LMC further order deduction/forfeiture of three points, the implementation of which is suspended until the end of the 2020/2021 season, provided that there is no similar or repeated breach within the period, in the event of which the points shall be deducted. The Clubs have 48 hours to respond in writing accepting the sanctions or electing to appear before a panel.
