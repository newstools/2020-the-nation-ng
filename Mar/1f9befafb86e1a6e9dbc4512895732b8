Forget the smile and the beautiful photos on social media, everyone has their personal battles. Until former Senator representing Bayelsa East Senatorial District, Ben Murray-Bruce, announced on Friday that he had lost his wife, Evelyn, to cancer, no one would have thought he had such a battle. The news hit the entire country like a storm. To many, the media mogul was living his best life and has little or no worries. The Chairman of Silverbird Group is vibrant, he has a beautiful family, looks dashing at all times and is a successful entrepreneur. On Twitter, he wrote: “I’m broken. Just lost my beautiful wife to cancer. She was my best friend for 43 years and my wife for 41 years. Cancer is real, but it shouldn’t be a death sentence – awareness, and early detection and treatment are key to survival. I miss her so much. I’m broken. “Our children are devastated, I am too. But I have to be strong for them. Please put our family in your prayers. Like the sun, my wife was a blessing and touched the lives of everyone she met. Though she’s gone, she’d remain alive in our hearts forever.”
