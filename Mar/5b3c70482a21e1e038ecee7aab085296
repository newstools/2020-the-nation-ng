The Edo State government has insisted that marketers of petrol across the state must dispense the product at the approved pump price of N125 per litre. Edo Commissioner for Minerals, Oil and Gas, Joseph Ikpea, who addressed reporters yesterday, while monitoring operations of petrol stations in Benin, stated that the essence of the exercise was to ensure that dealers comply with the Federal Government’s directive to dispense petrol at N125 per litre. He said the state government was not only concerned about the pump price, but the accuracy of metering of petroleum products to motorists. He said: “Complying with the new pump price is not the only issue, because some people can reduce the quantity of litres dispensed to motorists and adjust the pump price to reflect the N125 per litre. “Parts of the functions of the ministry is to ensure compliance among major and independent marketers. The level of compliance is commendable.” Among the filling stations visited, the dealers dispensed the product at the new approved pump price. An MRS service station manager, Sunday Adenuga, stated that the station adjusted its pump price a week ago, after the directive from the Federal Government, while urging other major marketers to comply with the directive, in the interest of members of the public.
