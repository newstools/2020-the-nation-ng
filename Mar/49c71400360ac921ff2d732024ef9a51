 The Funmi Ayinke Humanity Foundation, an organization that focuses on giving back to the society, hosted some students on Valentine’s Day at Mayfair Hall, Alausa, Lagos. Tagged ‘Charting Your Own Course And Destiny’, the event had a delegation of the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS), who came to honour  Funmi as their patron. The student leaders itemised Funmi’s interventions on behalf of her beneficiaries  in primary, secondary and tertiary schools who ordinarily would have dropped out of school. Engineer Funmi Ayinke Waheed thanked her husband, Prof Adekojo Waheed, a former DVC of the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta (FUNAAB), for his support and encouragement. She explained how the initiative had in the past been able to support widows and young people by increasing their earning capacity through the social development and empowerment programme. “Funmi Ayinke Humanity Foundation is primarily established to give back to society, improve the standards of living of those under our care. When it comes to helping someone, very often, we don’t weigh the potential thereof. My passion and desire for the vulnerable in society was borne out deep emotion and empathy for the socially deprived beings in our society today,” Funmi said.
