 HAS Nigerian government been complacent in its handling of the dreaded Coronavirus scourge? While the government may not want to agree that its handling of the developments relating to the pandemic had been less than proactive, developments across the country since Tuesday seems to suggest that the government has gone into panic mode, as fresh outbreak of the virus are being recorded with real fear that tracking the secondary contacts may become even more complex and challenging. And that is where the fear really is. Not only has the Federal Government banned all foreign trips by Ministers and other top government officials, a travel restriction has also been placed on 12 coronavirus burdened countries, even as more stiffer measures are been contemplated to reduce large gatherings thereby preventing communal transmission of the disease. Brig.-Gen. Shuaib Ibrahim, the Director-General (DG), National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), who announced the closure of camp nationwide said the Batch ‘A’ corps members will resume orientation camp as soon as the coast is clear over Covid-19. He said the management of NYSC decided to suspend the orientation camps against batch ‘A’ corps members across the country to curtail the spread of Coronavirus. The director-general said it was the same method the scheme employed during the Ebola epidemic which also threatened the health of the nation. Shuaib further said that the scheme had closed orientation camps across the country to safeguard the corps members.
