Elo Edremoda, Warri  Three persons reportedly died in a shootout by suspected cultists at a drinking bar in Agbarho, Ughelli North council area of Delta state, Sunday evening. Several others were said to have sustained varying degree of injuries and are currently receiving treatments at an undisclosed hospital. The Nation learnt that several youths had gathered to celebrate the birthday of a young lady (name withheld) at the bar that fateful evening. But while the celebration was ongoing, four unidentified boys stormed the bar with guns and opened fire on the group, including the celebrant, who was reportedly shot on both legs. Three victims of the attack were reported to have died at the scene of the incident, while others who sustained wounds, were rushed to a hospital. According to a source, “A girl was celebrating her birthday in the bar when the boys, about four of them, entered the place with pump action and shot at the people. The guy who sponsored the party was shot in the stomach, while the girl was shot on her legs. “Three people died instantly. The others were rushed to a clinic. We don’t really know why it happened, but might be all those their cult fights. The bar is kind of enclosed, that is why people could not really run away.” The Delta State Police Command confirmed the development to The Nation on Tuesday. Commissioner of Police, Mr. Hafiz Inuwa, said, “actually, I got a report that some people went to the bar and opened fire. As a result, one died in the bar. While two others were taken to the hospital, one died on the way and the other died in the hospital. Then two others sustained injuries and were taken to the hospital. “Three actually died and we are hunting for the perpetrators. It’s more like a cult-related issue, but we are not going to narrow our scope. We want to know the motive and those perpetrators. We are working hand-in-hand with some well-meaning members to get information.”
