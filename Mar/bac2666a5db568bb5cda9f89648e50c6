A source said, “The occupants of the Lexus SUV immediately  blocked him, disembarked and dragged him out, took his cell phones and forced him into their vehicle and zoomed off.” The eyewitness added that when the officers at the police divisional headquarterswere alerted, they came and pushed the victim’s abandoned vehichle to their station. Police spokesman Orlando Ikeokwu, who confirmed the incident, said that police have recovered the Beninese’s abandoned High Lander SUV. “It is true and we have recovered the victim’s High Lander Jeep but till now nobody has come to make an official report,” he said.
