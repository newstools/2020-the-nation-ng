Real Madrid defeated Barcelona 2-0 in the El-clásico match at the Santiago Bernabéu on Sunday to end its seven-match winless streak against its rival and return to the top of the Spanish league. Vinícius Júnior scored in the 71st minute and substitute Mariano Díaz sealed the victory in stoppage time to give Madrid a one-point lead over Barcelona and halt the team’s recent struggles. Lionel Messi had a quiet night, squandering a couple of good chances on one-on-one situations and being shown a late yellow card for a hard foul from behind on Madrid midfielder Casemiro. Former Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo was among the nearly 80,000 in attendance at the Bernabéu, as were players from the Wuhan Zall soccer team based in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus coronavirus outbreak.
