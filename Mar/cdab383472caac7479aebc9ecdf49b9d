 ROTARY International District 9110 has urged pupils and teachers to take handwashing very seriously to avoid contracting diseases, such as coronavirus and Lassa fever. District Governor Jide Akeredolu, a medical doctor, said water, sanitation and hygiene were among Rotary’s six focal areas. He spoke at a seminar organised by the District for schools in Ikeja. He said Rotary helps communities to get clean water and sanitation facilities to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. “When people have access to clean water and sanitation, water-borne diseases decrease; children stay healthier and attend school more regularly, and mothers can spend less time carrying water and more time helping their families,” he added. A guest speaker, Dr Femi Oloyede, who spoke on “Preventing the scourge of Coronavirus”, warned against touching the eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands. Regular hand wash with soap and water should be maintained, he advised. He urged people to observe personal hygiene by covering their faces when they sneeze or cough and to throw away used tissue papers. The pupils and teachers were also enlightened on how to prevent Lasser fever, which requires the eradication of rodents from homes, improved sanitation, safe food storage and preparation and proper hygiene. Rotary’s water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) committee Chairman Samson Okenyi said 17 of 20 schools invited for the programme attended.
