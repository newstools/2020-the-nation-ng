American gospel lyricist and singer, Bruce Baker, said Nigeria is the opposite of what people told him about while he was in America. Baker who was in Abuja at The Porch Omega Events Arena, Maitama, for a meet and greet with Abuja’s A listers, gospel artistes and entertainment pundits, gave examples of what he saw on television, and his experiences in the classrooms. The warm evening had some of the biggest gospel artistes who came in their numbers to celebrate with the American gospel rock artiste while they rendered guests with some of their top tunes from either their albums or singles. Baker, who said though he doesn’t know why God directed him to Abuja at this time, believed it’s been a worthy experience especially flashing back to what people have said about the largest black nation in the world. He said: “Everything changed when I came into the country, Nigeria is rich, it’s black owned, black power and that’s what everyone needs to see more in America.” Speaking further on his music and his reason for coming to Abuja, he said in the past three years, he has released over 15 tracks that were sold because he’s a professional lyricist. “This is my first single released as a non-lyricist. When the Holy Spirit told me to write music for myself this time; instead of creating sounds for people to purchase, I said God it’s a privilege because I’m so used to writing songs for other artistes. I said now it’s my turn and time, I’m going to create music in the universal and my voice is going to be heard.”
