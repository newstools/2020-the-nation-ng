 Journalists and other media workers in Lagos and Ogun states, as well as the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), have been advised to use their valid identity cards to access their places of work and assignment venues during the 14-day lockdown directed by President Muhamamdu Buhari. A statement in Abuja yesterday by Minister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed said the clarification becomes necessary in view of the inadequate time to properly accredit working journalists in the affected states and the FCT. He said members of the media are expected to continue to provide essential services during the lockdown to keep Nigerians well updated on the COVID-19 pandemic.
