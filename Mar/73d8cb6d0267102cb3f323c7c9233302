Ekiti State government on Tuesday announced that the only Coronavirus index case recorded in the state had recovered. Commissioner for Health, Dr Mojisola Yaya-Kolade, while briefing newsmen in Ado-Ekiti, said that the index case, who had been in isolation, was discharged after he had fully recovered. Yaya-Kolade said: “He has now tested negative. Everything is normal; we cannot continue to keep him. “What we told him was that when he gets home, he should still self-isolate and that if he is going out, he should wear face mask.” The commissioner, however, said that all the contacts, who were still in isolation, would remain there for the prescribed 14 days, adding, that all of them were stable and without any symptom. Yaya-Kolade said that the female care-giver of the late American, who had been in isolation, had also undergone tests for three times and that she was negative. (NAN)
