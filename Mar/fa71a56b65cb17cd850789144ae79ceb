In spite of the COVID-19 pandemic, members of the House of Representatives have started getting some of the 400 Toyota Camry 2020 as earlier decided by the lower legislative chamber. Although the decision to buy the vehicles was taken on February 5, 2020, the timing of distribution of the cars has attracted criticisms from different quarters. Apart from keeping the cost secret, the angst against the lawmakers was fuelled by the complacent display of the cars at the parking lots of the National Assembly. An angry critic, Frederick Odorige, said: “These legislators finalised plans to buy these vehicles during a closed door session on 5 February 2020 when COVID-19 was already spreading and other countries were planning and taking concrete actions against the deadly virus. “Nigerian politicians are very wicked and insensitive. Does it mean that they were trekking to the legislature or they had no personal vehicles before now? Did they swear an oath never to make a sacrifice for Nigerians? “They just approved N50 billion to be given to some Nigerians as loans because of Covid-19, which will attract interest. Not palliative measures. It means that Nigerians who are not in government can never enjoy from the country. “Sensible parliamentarians are currently donating their salaries in other countries. The ones in Nigeria receive the highest in the world and will continue to receive the same amount even as they stay at home because of the virus.”
