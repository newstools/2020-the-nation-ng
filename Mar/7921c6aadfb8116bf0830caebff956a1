Academics, spiritual leaders and other Nigerians have expressed concerns about the plethora of challenges facing the country. They called for concerted efforts to unite the nation for accelerated development and enduring peace. The eminent Nigerians spoke at the Ninth Rufus Okikiola Ositelu Foundation (ROOF) Colloquium, with the theme: Leadership: The Bane of Nigerian National Development, at the Aladura Comprehensive High School’s Multipurpose Hall in Anthony Village, Lagos. Most of the speakers blamed ineffective leadership for the nation’s woes. They called for the strengthening of national unity, raised concerns about the consequences of impunity and corruption at high places, as well as the prevailing insecurity and gross underdevelopment across the country. The colloquium was organised by the Board of Trustees (BoT) of the foundation. Its Chairman Dr. Olusoga Badejo said the foundation was conceived as an instrument for the promotion of democracy, freedom, human rights, justice and the rule of law in a non-partisan manner. Reverend Rufus Ositelu, the founder of ROOF and the Archbishop of Church of the Lord, said: “When we speak of underdevelopment, it is easy to point to obvious factors, like bad leadership, insincerity and corruption. However, a very important factor, which is basic to every practice in government, is decision-making process. “If the process of decision-making by a leader goes against the norms of rationality and dictates of conscience, then such a leader qualifies to be classified as a bad leader.” Venerable Professor Olufemi Onabanjo, the immediate past vice chancellor of Lead City University in Ibadan, Oyo State, noted that though good leadership was lacking in the country, the nations also needs good followers “We may not be lucky with the crop of leaders that we’ve had over the years, but the followership cannot be absolved. The followership is docile and unwilling to call leaders to account,” he said.
