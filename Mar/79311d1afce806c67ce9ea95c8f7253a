A statement by Chairman of the State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB), Prof. Francisca Aladejana, said the 30-minutes daily programme tagged ‘school on air’ is designed to positively engage pupils who are on indefinite break as part of government’s effort to contain the spread of Coronavirus.

Aladejana stressed that the programme would be interactive, adding that there would be a phone-in segment at the end of each edition which would allow for questions and answers.
