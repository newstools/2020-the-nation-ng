A fresh calamity hit China on Saturday after a hotel converted to Corona virus quarantine facility unexpectedly collapsed, trapping at least 70 people. The five-story Xinjia Hotel in Quanzhou city went down at about 7:30 p.m. local time. “I was just having dinner and I suddenly heard a loud bang and thought it was an explosion,” a man living across the street told the South China Morning Post. “It was not until I ran to my balcony that I saw that the entire hotel building had collapsed,” he said. A rescue operation got underway immediately with 38 already saved at press time. Officials could not confirm whether anyone died in the accident. Quanzhou authorities said over 700 rescue workers had been deployed to the scene along with ambulances, excavators and cranes. The 80-room hotel was recently converted to a quarantine facility for people who had recent contact with Corona virus patients, the People’s Daily state newspaper reported. Footage captured rescuers searching for injured people after the hotel collapsed overhead. The collapse, which was caught on camera, shows the hotel levelling to the ground as rescue workers battled on. No reason for the collapse was given. China which has been battling with the Corona virus outbreak for about two months now reported 99 new cases yesterday. This is the first time since January 20 that Beijing is reporting less than 100 new cases. The government reported 28 new fatalities, raising the mainland death toll to 3,070.
