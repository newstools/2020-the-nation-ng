Former internationals Mutiu Adepoju and Vincent Enyeama have lauded the calibre of players Gernot Rohr invited for the Super Eagles clash against Sierra Leone in the AFCON 2021 qualifier. Eagles’ head coach had on Wednesday released a 23-man list of players for the upcoming 2021 AFCON Qualifier against Sierra Leone in Asaba. Adepoju said that the players called up ‘are good enough’ to beat any team. “I think it’s a very good list of players, they are all doing very well in their various clubs,” he said.  ”The lads on the list merit their invitation.” In his assessment of the squad, Enyeama who helped Nigeria win a third AFCON title in 2013 said Rohr has assembled a good team that is capable of beating anybody. “This is a very good team. This generation can conquer everyone,” he tweeted. The Super Eagles are the leaders in Group L of the AFCON 2021 qualifiers after two consecutive wins over Republic of Benin and Lesotho. For the game, Rohr recalled Iheanacho who has been in and out of the squad since he was dropped from the AFCON 2019 squad. The 23-year-old is now back after his resurgence with the Foxes. Since December 2019, the forward has been a regular for Brendan Rodgers’ side and has scored some important goals. Also in the squad is Belgian-born Cyriel Dessers who is currently the highest goalscorer in the Dutch Eredivisie where he plays for Heracles Almelo and FC Cologne’s Kingsley Ehizibue. There are regulars in Rohr’s 24-man squad including captain Ahmed Musa, his vice, Troost-Ekong and others including Iwobi, Wilfred Ndidi, Aribo, Victor Osimhen etc. Victories in the doubleheader will guarantee Nigeria a spot at the 33rd AFCON scheduled for Cameroon in 2021. All invited players are to report in the Delta State capital on Monday, March 23.
