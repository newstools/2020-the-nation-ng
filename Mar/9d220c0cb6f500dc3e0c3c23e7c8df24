The Commonwealth on Tuesday said it has developed a Coronavirus tracker that shows daily cases in member countries which have recorded 12,707 infected and 340 dead persons as at Monday, March 23. The tracker, it said, collects data from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and show the total confirmed Coronavirus cases and deaths in affected member countries. According to a statement released Tuesday night, the organisation said the tracker would help.countries prepare and respond to the pandemic. Assistant Secretary-General Nabeel Goheer said: “Coronavirus has rapidly spread across the world affecting people, livelihoods and nations. “The Commonwealth, as an organisation that believes in innovation, has prepared this tracker that offers real-time and accurate insight for governments to make informed decisions on this worsening crisis.” A Commonwealth analysis suggests access to hospital beds and ventilators are limited in many countries, which could present a major challenge if Coronavirus is not contained early enough, it said. Kathleen McCourt, President of the Commonwealth Nurses and Midwives Federation, said: “Commonwealth nurses and midwives are at the forefront of the global Covid-19 response. They are reporting inadequate access to personal protective equipment, being asked to work in unfamiliar environments and inconsistent or absent access to testing for healthcare workers “We are encouraging national organisations to contribute data to the Commonwealth coronavirus tracker. This data will better prepare and equip healthcare workers to tackle this global emergency.”
