The Lagos State Vehicle Inspection Office said it has commenced the issuancof compliance letters to corporate organisations, associations, unions institutions and other professional bodies to present their fleet for the computerised vehicle inspection, the state VIO Director Akin George Fashola said on Thursday. Fashola, in a statement issued by the Head of Research, Planning and Development Olumide Olayemi said the move was in line with the vision of the Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-olu, in which Traffic Management and Transportation is one of the pillars of his administration. The letter titled statutory inspection of vehicles for road worthiness mandates all private sector players to present vehicles in their fleet for the computerised vehicle inspection. He stated that this measure becomes necessary as part of the drive to ensure that vehicles plying the state roads meet the minimum standards of safety as vehicles are expected to drive with a valid and updated Road Worthiness Certificate as well as MOT Test Certificate. He stated; “Fleet vehicles fall under the spectrum of commercial vehicles whose risks must be mitigated to ensure they are safe at all times for use by staff. This is why it is necessary to ensure that the vehicles must be inspected to determine its road worthiness status”. According to Fashola “recipients of the demand for compliance letters have been issued road worthiness certificates but are yet to present the vehicles at its Lagos Computerised Vehicle Inspection Service, LACVIS, test centres. Hence, administrators of fleet of vehicles have an obligation to carry out the statutory inspection and to be informed if there are any defects detected which will form part of their fleet policy maintenance routines.”
