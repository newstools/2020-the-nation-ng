Gunmen have killed four soldiers, including an Army captain, in an ambush at Sarkin Pawa in Munya Local Government Area of Niger State. Three other soldiers were injured. The deceased were a captain who led the soldiers in the operation, a staff sergeant and two corporals. The soldiers were said to have responded to distress calls from Gwar community in Munya Local Government where the gunmen had invaded and were carrying out a house to house raid. The soldiers, upon receiving the distress call, mobilised from their base at Zazzaga community and headed for Gwar community accompanied by some armed policemen in their armoured vehicle. It was learnt that the gunmen had taken off when they sighted the soldiers, but laid an ambush for them. The soldiers had followed them into the bush. The gunmen were said to have fired immediately the soldiers entered the bush, killing the captain on the spot. The other three soldiers were killed during the gun battle between the soldiers and the gunmen, which lasted for over an hour. The hoodlums burnt two Hilux vans of the soldiers and went away with the soldiers’ machine gun (MG) rifle. The Chairman of Munya Local Government, Alhaji Mohammed Garba Dazz, confirmed the incident to reporters, saying the over 30 gunmen invaded the village and held them hostage for hours before the soldiers rescued them. “I provided logistics to the soldiers before they left for the operation, but the soldiers and police were overpowered due to a large number of the gunmen. “One hour after they left for the scene, they came back with bullet holes in their armoured vehicle. The glass was shattered. “As I speak with you, they have killed four soldiers. Three others were seriously injured. They have also burnt the Hilux Van of the soldiers. “The bodies of the soldiers have been brought to the Sarkin Power Police Station and I’m just from there. That is all I can tell you for now.”
