Our Reporter  YORUBA actor, Yomi Fabiyi, in a recent Instagram post, has drawn the public attention to why most celebrities like to draw boundaries. The actor and producer said people are entitled to privacy, thus the need to stand up and say no to what you cannot take. “Draw the lines around yourself. Personal boundaries are the imaginary lines you draw around yourself that no one should cross either physically – unless invited in – or emotionally,” said Fabiyi. “You are entitled to respect, privacy, decency, kindness, love, truth and honour to name but a few rights. If people cross the lines, blur the boundaries, you are entitled to stand up for yourself and say, ‘No, I won’t put up with this.’ But do so with decorum, politeness and humility.”  He also noted that setting boundaries means one is no longer scared. “Setting personal boundaries mean you don’t have to be scared of other people anymore. You now have a clear idea of what you will put up with and what you won’t. “Once someone crosses the line between appropriate and inappropriate behaviour, it gets really easy to say, ‘No, I don’t want to be treated like this or spoken to like this.’ Setting personal boundaries enables us to resist pushy people, rude people, aggressive people, people who will take advantage of us. Successful people are the ones who can recognize emotional blackmail, people playing games with them, people who need to make you look small to make themselves feel big.
