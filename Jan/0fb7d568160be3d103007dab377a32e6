 AN Igbosere Magistratesâ€™ Court, Lagos, on Monday sentenced three cultists to one month in the Nigerian Correctional Services (NCS) centre for unlawful assembly. The convicts are Babatunde Oyekunle, 27, Ahmed Oyetunde, 27, and Ismaila Ayinla. Magistrate Mrs Folashade Botoku found the defendants guilty of unlawful assembly, parading oneself as member of a cult and belonging to an unlawful society brought against them by the Police. She sentenced them to one month on each of the three counts and ordered that the sentence should run concurrently. The magistrate said that the sentence would take effect from of the date of arraignment. Botoku advised the convicts to desist from life of crime otherwise would face the full wrath of law if caught committing any offence again. The convicts were first arraigned on December 24, 2019. They pleaded not guilty. They were granted N100, 000 bail each with two sureties each in like sum. However, at resumed proceedings on Monday, the trio could not perfect their bail. They also changed their plea of not guilty to guilty. They pleaded with the court to temper justice with mercy, adding that they had renounced cultism. The Prosecutor, Sgt. Chinedu Njoku, had earlier told the court that the trio committed the offences on December 13, 2019 at 10.00p.m. at Osho Langbasa Village, Ajah, Lagos. He said that the trio paraded themselves as members of cult, causing breach of the public peace.
