Renowned cleric, Pastor Mathew Ashimolowo and his wife, Yemisi, are to celebrate 21,000 widows at the annual widows’ event, which will hold at Kings University, Gbongan-Osogbo Road, Ode- Omu in Osun State on Saturday, from 8am. The event, the 14th edition, is a gathering of widows. It is unseen and unheard of anywhere and should make the Guinness Book of Record. The widows are from Ode-Omu, Ile-Ife, Modakeke, Oshogbo, Ikire, Ikoyi, Apomu and others. The Nation learnt that the 14th edition is to commemorate the 60th birthday of Mrs. Ashimolowo. It was gathered that the event is a personal, corporate, social responsibility of Pastor Ashimolowo and his wife, which has been held for the past 13 years to minister to the poor. “It is not a Kingsway International Christian Centre (KICC) project. The widows are given clothes, money and food. “Those expected at the event are Osun State Governor Gboyega Oyetola, monarchs from 15 towns, pastors, bishops, captains of industries, members of KICC in London who are coming to serve freely, as well as KICC members in Nigeria.”
