A member of the Rotary Club of Victoria Island East, Dr. Oluwaseye Yomi-Sholoye, has promised to foot the medical bills of 50 girls suffering from cervical cancer. Yomi-Sholoye will also partner the club on the adoption of the Aro Community at Jakande in Eti-Osa Local Government through the ‘Be A Guardian (BAG) project.’ The philanthropist stated this in her acceptance speech during her induction as a full member of the club. Yomi-Sholoye and 21 others were inducted as inductees and honorary inductees of the club. She promised to, alongside the new members, “…do exploits for humanity…under the leadership of our District Governor through whose cervical cancer initiative I have informed the president to sponsor the treatment for 20 girls today and another 30 girls later.” Dr. Yomi-Sholoye, who is also Deputy Primate of Faith Mission, Cherubim & Seraphim Church, Satellite Town, said this was part of her life’s goal to give back to the society, which was why she set up the Oluseye Yomi-Sholoye Foundation. She noted that the club had executed several projects in youth empowerment, development, education, scholarships and health and pledged to support this too and she would key into this. “I will partner the club in the adoption of the Aro Community at Jakande, Eti-Osa Local Government Area through the ‘Be A Guardian’ (BAG) project. There are about 7,000 inhabitants in this abandoned community close to most of us on this Lekki axis,” Yomi-Sholoye said. She said that the youth would get scholarships for education and vocational training among others. “I will call on my friends and partners to join me in this movement,” she added. Rotary Club of Victoria Island East President Otunba Gbemi Oyeneyin and Mr. Eyitayo Adebowale were host and chairman of the occasion, which was attended by the board, executive, members of the club and guests.
