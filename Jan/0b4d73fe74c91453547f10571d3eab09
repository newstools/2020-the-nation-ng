 Ondo State Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu on Thursday advised support groups in the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state to work together to achieve a common goal. Akeredolu gave the advice in Akure during a courtesy visit by Sunshine Integrity Movement, a group propagating the governor’s interest by showcasing his achievements in the public domain and sending responses to him. He stressed the need for all the groups to be consolidated under ‘Team Aketi’ in order to be successful in their common goal of seeking his re-election. He said: “There must be team Aketi. All the groups that want our success are part of the larger Team Aketi. “My advice to Team Aketi is that they should not drive others and say that the government is for them alone. “Most of us in this group have different backgrounds, but we are all here to work together. That is how it’s supposed to be.” The governor reiterated the commitment of his administration to ensuring that all nooks and crannies in the state witness unprecedented development. He said that there was no local government that had not got a touch of the SUBEB schools, promising that the government would start another set by March. Earlier, leader of the team, Prof. Olu Aboluwoye, lauded the governor for his commitment to the development of all parts of the state.
