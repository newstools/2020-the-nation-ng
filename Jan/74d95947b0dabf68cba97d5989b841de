Governorship candidate of All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2017 in Anambra State Tony Nwoye has empowered 600 youths in Nsugbe, his community, with materials worth over N80 million. Some items donated by Nwoye include over 150 motorcycles, 200 sewing machines, 200 grinding machines and N6 million naira. Nwoye said the gesture was part of his resolve to empower his people to reduce crime and unemployment. He said he was disturbed each time he saw people, especially youths, roam the streets because they had no jobs. President-General of the community Ikechukwu Nwalunor praised Nwoye for his magnanimity., saying the former lawmaker had endeared himself to the people. He urged him not to relent. A beneficiary, Okafor Cecelia, said if they had people like Nwoye in Anambra, the state would not have unemployment. The people honoured five of their sons and daughters, including Rear Admiral Perry Onwuzulike; Prof. Uju Dibua, of University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN); and Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) of Criminal Investigation Department (CID) in Sokoto State Charles Mozie.
