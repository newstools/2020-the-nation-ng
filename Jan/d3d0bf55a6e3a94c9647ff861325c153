Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has backed Manchester United for a top four finish in the Premier League this season. The Premier League clash between United and Liverpool at Anfield today (Sunday) could prove crucial to Champions League qualification as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side strive to haul in Chelsea in the race for fourth place. Chelsea’s 1-0 defeat to Newcastle on Saturday evening left them just five points ahead of United. Solskjaer’s men can close that gap to two with an improbable win against Klopp’s side, who have won every league game apart from one this term — the reverse fixture against United at Old Trafford. And the German manager believes United have the quality required to finish fourth. “United have a really good football team, talented and experienced,” he said.  “There is a lot of good potential on the pitch. “I think they will probably qualify for the Champions League this season. “So, of course they can beat us. But they can only play as good as we let them play. “If we are at our best it’s difficult for every team. It’s our stadium so we have to make sure everybody knows that.” Klopp has a poor record against United as Liverpool boss. He has only won two of 10 meetings with the Anfield club’s North West rivals. United will hope to repeat their previous two performances against Liverpool, which both ended in draws.
