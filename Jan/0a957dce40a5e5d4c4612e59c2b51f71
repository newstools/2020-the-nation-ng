 Free -scoring Super Eagles striker Victor Osimhen was on target once more on Saturday, grabbing a 92nd minute goal to hand Lille next round place in the Coupe de France. Osimhen, who has become a beautiful bride with top clubs seeking to have him for keeps, increased the tally for Lille after teammate and homeboy Loïc Rémy had grabbed the opening goal in the 69th minute of the match. Lille proved they were the better and more experienced side playing against a fifth division side Gonfreville, who only managed to keep 23% possession. Interestingly Osimhen started the game from the bench after replacing Luiz Araujo in the 61st minute, but got the consolidation goal that sent the fans into frenzy.
