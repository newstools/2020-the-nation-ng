 A HIGH Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) in Gwagwalada in Abuja has granted a N50 million bail to a former Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mohammed Adoke (SAN). In a ruling on Thursday, Justice Abubakar Kutigi upheld Adoke’s bail request and ordered him to produce a surety in like sum. Justice Kutigi also admitted Adoke’s co-defendants- Aliyu Abubakar and Rasky Gbinigie- to bail pending the determination of corruption allegations against them. He gave Abubakar bail at N50 million and Gbinijie got bail at N10 million. The judge said the sureties must be responsible citizens, who must depose affidavits of means. Justice Kutigi said the sureties must be resident within the court’s jurisdiction and must own verifiable landed properties worth the bail sum. The judge ordered the sureties to tender their three years tax clearance certificates, and ordered the defendants to deposit their international passports with the court. Justice Kutigi ordered the defendant not to travel abroad without first, seeking the court’s permission. The judge said the defendants must sign a written undertaking not to interfere with any of the prosecution witnesses and to make themselves available for trial at all times. Justice Kutigi said a breach of any of the conditions would warrant automatic revocation of their bail. The judge adjourned till March 26, 2020 for the prosecution to open its case. Adoke and six others, including four corporate organisations, are being tried on a 42-count charge brought against them by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over their alleged complicity in the $1.2 billion fraud allegedly associated with the Malabu Oil deal.
