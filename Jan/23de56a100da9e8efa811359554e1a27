Wydad Casablanca qualified for the quarter-finals of the African Champions League with a 3-1 win over Algeria’s USM Alger on Friday. The Moroccan club are second in Group C, two points behind leaders Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa, with one group match left to play. Sundowns had already booked their place before their 2-2 draw at Petro de Luanda on Saturday. Only the top two from each group can qualify for the quarter-finals. Wydad, under new coach Sebastien Desabre, took an early lead against USMA through Walid El Karti who scored after just seven minutes. Badi Aouk made it 2-nil to the hosts midway through the first half with Kazadi Kaasengu adding a third for Wydad just before the break. The Algerians fought back in the second half and were rewarded with a consolation goal from Mohamed Rabie Meftah. Mamelodi Sundowns went into their penultimate Group C match against Petro de Luanda on Saturday safe in the knowledge that they had already qualified for the knock-out phase. In an entertaining game, two penalties featured in the first half – Gaston Sirino putting Sundowns ahead from the spot early on with Job equalising four minutes before half-time. In the second half, Jacques Tuyisenge put the Angolans ahead but an injury time equaliser from Motjeka Madisha ensured Sundowns left with a 2-2 draw. In another match on Friday night, Egypt’s Zamalek could only manage a 0-0 draw with already-qualified TP Mazembe of DR Congo in Group A. It means Zamalek will confirm their place in the quarter-finals if Angola’s Primeiro de Agosto fail to win against Zambia’s Zesco United in the other Group A game on Saturday in Ndola.
