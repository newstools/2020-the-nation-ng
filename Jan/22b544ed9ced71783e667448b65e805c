 Isheri-OSUN near lsolo, Lagos holds a lot of promises for the young, not only because of the cheaper rents but its proximity to almost every point in Lagos. A business woman, Miss Favour Simeon, said if given the opportunity to live alone, she  would go for a self-contained apartment, where she would not share services with other occupants of the house. “Except I will be living with other people, if not, I think it is just good enough considering equipping it and managing the place alone. I will like the house to be  in a calm environment, possibly a bit closer to my place of work,” she added. She urged the government to provide the needed infrastructure,  especially good roads, electricity and green areas to enable the young to express themselves through sports and other activities that would keep them off from crime. A younger Murontayo Oyetunde, said: “ lf am to make choice of an apartment, I will want something not too big and something not poor a two room with toilet and bathroom or self contained. My reason is that, I don’t want to leave in a very big apartment that I won’t be able to keep up with the maintenance, except the person giving me the opportunity is ready to pay every bill.’’ The economy however, does not support such life style so l may  likely go for a self contain in a very good environment that doesn’t cost more than my budget, so that I can conveniently  pay my rent whenever it  is due” Valentine Chisom said “ If am given the opportunity to make a choice of house, I will like to stay in a very comfortable place like a three bedroom flat in a very good environment.” Zion Temitope also said: ‘’I will go for a mini flat because the location is very  close to my place of work and it  make  for easy accessibility.” Deborah Praise said the allure of Isheri-Osun is as a result of its moderate cost  and ambience for a young person starting life.
