Still trying to recover from the pangs of the last governorship poll in Kano State, ex-Governor Rabiu Kwankwaso has been singing lullaby in the last few days after the Supreme Court sealed the fate of his political godson, Abba Kabir Yusuf, by declaring Governor Abdullahi Ganduje as duly elected for second term. He was pained by the judicial verdict that a video in circulation confirmed his political frustration. In March 2018, he had boasted that he will retire President Muhammadu Buhari and Ganduje from politics. But his prophesy turned against him. And as if the judgment was not enough, the Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party in the state, Alh. Rabiu Sulaiman Bichi, defected from the opposition to the All Progressives Congress(APC) barely two days after the Supreme Court affirmed Gandujeâ€™s victory. The reality has dawned on Kwankwaso that for eight years, he has to be on the sideline in Kano politics. Will he regain his political grits?
