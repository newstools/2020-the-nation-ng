By Taofik Salako, Capital Market Editor  Nigerian equities rode on the back of year-end enthusiasm to rally net capital gains of N112 billion yesterday, the last trading session of 2019. Ace comedian, Bright Okpocha, popularly known as Basket mouth, beat the traditional closing gong to declare the equities market closed for the year. The last-day rally however appeared to be the comedy side of the market as benchmark indices showed average decline of 0.59 per cent for the month of December 2019 and full year return of -14.60 per cent for 2019. Aggregate market value of all quoted equities at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) rose from its opening value of N12.846 trillion to close yesterday at N12.958 trillion. The All Share Index-the benchmark value index, also trended upward from its opening index of 26,609.34 points to close at 26,842.07 points, representing average gain of 0.87 per cent. The last trading rally was symbolic of Santa Claus rally, the tendency for stock prices to go up in the week after Christmas, mostly in anticipation of expected positioning for dividends by the first month of the New Year. Quoted equities had after the yuletide holidays reopened on Monday to a bullish market. Average gain stood at 0.73 per cent on Monday, equivalent to net capital gain of N93 billion. With nearly two advancers for every decliner, all sectoral indices closed on the upside with the exception of the NSE Consumer Goods Index, which dropped by 0.23 per cent. The NSE Oil & Gas Index appreciated by 6.71 per cent. The NSE Industrial Goods Index rose by 2.17 per cent. The NSE Insurance Index rallied by 1.96 per cent while the NSE Banking Index posted average gain of 1.37 per cent.  There were 24 advancers against 13 decliners. Seplat Petroleum Development Company led the gainers with a gain of N59.80 to close at N657.80. Stanbic IBTC Holdings followed with a gain of N2 to close at N41. Lafarge Africa rose by N1.30 to close at N15.30. Guaranty Trust Bank added 70 kobo to close at N29.70 while Okomu Oil Palm chalked up 60 kobo to close at N55.60 per share. On the negative side, Nigerian Breweries led with a loss of 75 kobo to close at N59. UPDC Real Estate Investment Trust dropped by 45 kobo to close at N4.25. FBN Holdings and Dangote Sugar Refinery lost 20 kobo each to close at N6.15 and N13.60 respectively while Africa Prudential dropped by 18 kobo to close at N4 per share. Total turnover however dropped by 32.86 per cent with the exchange of 267.03 million shares valued at N5.50 billion in 2,445 deals. Access Bank was the most active stock with a turnover of 47.31 million shares. Analysts at Afrinvest Securities stated that the last-day rally was partly driven by portfolio rebalancing activities by asset and portfolio managers. “In the coming year, we expect the local bourse to resume trading on a weak note as investors remain averse to the equities market. However, in the near term, we anticipate that the impact of the low-yield environment in the fixed income space due to the CBN’s policy on OMO could drive buying interest in undervalued stocks,” Afrinvest Securities stated.
