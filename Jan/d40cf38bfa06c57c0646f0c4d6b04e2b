Kaduna State Police Command has confirmed the death of six persons during an attack on the Emir of Potiskum, Alhaji Umaru Bubaram, on the Kaduna-Zaria highway on Tuesday night. Spokesman Yakubu Sabo said that the incident occurred at about 11:00pm. It was gathered that several people might have been abducted by the attackers, as empty vehicles were left on the scene when government officials visited on Wednesday. It’s not clear as to the degree of injury sustained by the Emir, but Sabo said the monarch was at Barau Dikko Hospital in Kaduna and was “doing very well.“ He said four of those killed were aides of the emir, while two were commuters. Sabo said Police Commissioner Umar Muri had visited the emir in hospital. He said investigation has begun. Senate President Ahmad Lawan last night condemned the gun attack  on the convoy of the Emir. Special Adviser (Media) to the Senate President, Ola Awoniyi, in a statement said gunmen on Tuesday night attacked the convoy of the Emir around Maraban Jos on Kaduna-Zaria road, killing some of the Emir’s aides and leaving others injured. He said Lawan expressed his condolences to  the revered Emir and the families of those killed in the sad incident. He added that the Senate President also prayed for speedy recovery of the Emir and others who were injured. “Lawan called on the security agencies to ensure that everyone with a hand in the heinous crime is brought to justice. “He also called on the security agencies to ensure quick rescue of those who were abducted in the incident,” Awoniyi said.
