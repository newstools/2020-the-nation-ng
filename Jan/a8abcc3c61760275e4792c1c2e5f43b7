A Karu Grade I Area Court, Abuja on Friday sentenced an 18-year-old boy, Chidera Sunday, to two years imprisonment for posing as a woman to secure a maid job. The judge, Abdullahi Jibrin, sentenced Sunday without an option of fine, after the convict pleaded guilty to joint act and impersonation. Earlier, the prosecutor, Ayotunde Adeyanj, told the court that one Leonard Ezirike of Jikwoyi reported the matter at the Jikwoyi Police Station on Dec. 22. Adeyanju alleged that on Dec. 18, the convict was brought to his house to work as a maid. ”Little did he know that the convict conspired with one Happiness and one Chinedu and disguised as a woman. “However, on Dec. 21, an in-law called and informed him the convict was not a woman but a man,”Adeyanju said. The offence, he said, is punishable under the provision of sections 79 and 179 of the Penal Code. (NAN)
