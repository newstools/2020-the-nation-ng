Damian Duruiheoma, Owerri Three days after political thugs invaded Independent National Electoral Commission(INEC)’s collation centre and tore the election results in Orlu/Orsu/Oru East Federal Constituency, the Independent National Electoral Commission has declared Jerry Alagbaoso of the Peoples Democratic Party winner of the supplementary election held last Saturday in the constituency. The returning officer of the election, Emma Anakwuba, announced the results and returned the PDP candidate under tight security at INEC’s office in Owerri on Tuesday. The thugs had reportedly accused the electoral umpire of compromising the exercise. INEC had already collated results of 14 out of 18 polling units before the hoodlums struck. The results of the remaining four polling units were collated at the INEC’s headquarters in Owerri on Tuesday and thereafter, a winner was returned. The returning officer said that the PDP candidate scored 22,475 votes to emerge the winner. According to Anakwuba, the All Progressives Congress candidate, Eddy Iheanacho got 20, 814 votes while All Progressives Grnad Alliance got 5,099 votes. He said: ” That Jerry Alagbaoso of the PDP having scored highest number of votes and satisfied the requirements of the law is returned elected.” The winner, who was first elected into the House of Representatives 2011, was reelected in 2015 and was declared winner again in 2019. An appeal court in Owerri partially canceled his victory in 2019 and ordered a supplementary election in 18 polling units in the federal constituency.
