 THE Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has urged the Federal Government to ensure that it addressed the unemployment crisis facing the country this year. The union said it will mount a robust campaign for the generation of mass jobs and for existing jobs to be decent. Its President Comrade Ayuba Wabba said NLC was perfecting plans for a national job summit in 2020, adding that all stakeholders, including the government will be involved. He said “We will get stakeholders including experts, policymakers, concerned demographers and workers on a roundtable to find answers and solutions to Nigeria’s burgeoning unemployment crisis. “In the spirit of growing the economy and creating jobs, we urge our compatriots especially our elite to change our consumption habits. We must consume what we produce. “We must patronize “Made-in-Nigeria”. Workers under NLC’s leadership will continue to work assiduously towards the promotion of national security, peace and unity. “We will continue to put the needed weight on the things that unite us and hold in contempt the things that seek to divide us. “We encourage our political leaders to exemplify the same by their utterances and conduct. By so doing, we would be laying an enduring foundation for national peace, unity, and development.” Ayuba urged the government to prioritize the security of lives and property, adding that Nigeria has seen enough bloodshed. “While we commend the sacrifice and commitment of our soldiers and other security personnel in the war against insurgency and other violent crimes across Nigeria, we urge government to do all it takes to end the bloodletting and brigandage in different parts of the country,’’ he added.
