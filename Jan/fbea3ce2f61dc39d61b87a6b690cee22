National Drugs Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) says it will partner with Adamawa Government in the rehabilitation of victims of drugs abuse. State Commander of the agency, Bello Idris, disclosed this in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday in Yola. Idris said the command rehabilitation unit needed working collaboration with the government and interested Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) to strengthen the effective rehabilitation service. “The Command is making contact with the State Ministry of Sport on the rehabilitation of victims of drugs abuse. Also, the Command is making effort to collaborate with some NGOs in strengthening the activities of the Command,’ Idris said. He expressed concern over the stigmatisation of rehabilitated drug victims in the society, explaining that drug victims were same as sick person that needs medical attention. The commander noted that among the major constraints affecting the effective service delivery of the command was inadequate manpower. Idris said that the command could not succeed alone in fight against drugs, hence he solicits for the support of citizens of the state.
