 The 2019 Lagos Governor’s Belt winner Abdulafeez Osoba has been ranked the eighth best amateur boxer in the Welterweight division in the world, according to yourboxingclub.com. Osoba, who won the silver medal at the 2019 African Games, is now the second best Welterweight in Africa, two places behind Clair Merven from Mauritus. He lost to the Africa Games final to the popular Merven on points in his first international competition for Nigeria. The 24-year-old electrician won a gold medal at National Sport Festival in Abuja in 2018 and was voted the winner of the Lagos Governor’s belt last December. Osoba has now set his eyes on qualifying for the Olympic Games by winning the welterweight class event at the African Olympic Qualifiers in Dakar, Senegal next month and believes he can still grow as a boxer. “I am currently working towards securing the number 1 spot in the continent at the African Qualifiers in Senegal next month and qualify for the Summer Olympics in Japan where I hope to win at least a medal.” Osoba said in a chat with NationSport. “Boxing changed my life, most definitely. My confidence has improved, and I feel I still can grow as I continue in this sport.” Other Nigeria boxers ranked includes Africa Games women’s middleweight bronze medalist Toyin Adejumola (13th), two-time Governor’s Belt winner and women’s flyweight Ayisat Oriyomi (19th) and Bolanle Shogbamu who is 12th and first in Africa in the women’s welterweight division.
