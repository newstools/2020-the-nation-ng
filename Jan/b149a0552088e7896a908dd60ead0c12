 GUNMEN have attacked a former Attorney-General and Commissioner of Edo State, Barr. Henry Idahagbon. The gunmen were said to have arrived Idahagbon’s office along Siluko road in Bénin City and started shooting sporadically. People relaxing at a restaurant in the ground floor of the building were said to have scampered for safety. Some witnesses said shots were fired at the building. Idahagbon was said to have ran out through the exit door of the two storey building. Speaking in a chat with reporters, Idahagbon alleged that the attackers used a state government Hilux vehicle. He said he was inside the building when the shooting started but he narrowly escaped being hit. His words, “It was the state government vehicle that they used. They came in a government Hilux van and started shooting at the building. “They broke everything at the restaurant. It was a government vehicle. “The President should declare a state of emergency. They have turned their gun barrel against their citizens”. But Special Adviser to Governor Godwin Obaseki on Media and Communication Strategy, Mr. Crusoe Osagie, said the alleged attack on Idahagbon, was one of the latest step in the plot by National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, to disrupt peace and safety in Edo State.
