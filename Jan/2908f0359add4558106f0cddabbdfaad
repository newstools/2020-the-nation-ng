A 26-YEAR-OLD woman, Amarachi Akomas and two teenagers, who allegedly stole a woman’s underwear, on Monday appeared at a Yaba Chief Magistrates’ Court in Lagos. The police charged Akomas, Chidinma Obiefuka, 18 and a 15-year-old girl with three counts of conspiracy, theft and breach of the peace. They pleaded not guilty. Prosecuting Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Thomas Nurudeen told the court that the defendants allegedly committed the offence at about 5am, on January 10, at 15, Olabulo Street, Ojo, Lagos. He alleged that Akomas sent the two teenagers to the neighbourhood to “gather” women’s underwear from the cloth line. Nurudeen alleged that the third defendant (the minor), was caught by the complainant, Mrs. Agu White, while removing her bras and pants that were spread outside her house. Nurudeen told the court that the third defendant (Ezeigbo), stole seven pants and a black bra valued at N9,500. “We recovered some of the underwear, but we are yet to figure out what they intend to do with them,” the prosecutor said. The offence, he said, contravened sections 168(d), 411 and 287 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State 2015 (Revised). Chief Magistrate K. B. Ayeye admitted the defendants to bail in the sum of N20,000 with two sureties each in the like sum. She said the sureties must be employed with evidence of three years tax payment to the Lagos State Government.
