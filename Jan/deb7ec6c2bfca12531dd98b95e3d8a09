 Minister of Works & Housing Babatunde Fashola said the Apapa- Oshodi Expressway will increase the economic fortunes of the country as Apapa is one of the economic power house of the nation. He spoke on the sidelines of his recent inspection of the expressway with the Federal Controller of Works in Lagos, Adedamola Kuti and Alhaji Aliko Dangote, whose firm is co-financing the construction of the road. Kuti, who said the expressway is a key factor to the country’s development, added the government is committed to completing in record time. Fashola said though the public  may be seeing just a road, the government is  seeing an added economic value to the country.  He said this was a strategic economic intervention,  noting that the materials used are all local in origin, including the cement. He promised intervention in other roads across the country. A truck driver Sule Tayo, who spoke to The Nation, said  the congestion on Apapa-Oshodi road is alarming. “There are over 20 bonded terminals but only Apapa port that is working and this is the result of the road congestion,’’ he stated . Another driver Henry Okonkwo also said he had been driving on the Apapa-Oshodi road for the last 20 years and pleaded with the government to provide refuse dump and  toilets at strategic points on the expressway, adding that it is the only way it can be preserved. He regretted that a port that should be a unique place is looking tattered and filled with  human waste. He said: “Let them give us a refuse dump and a toilet facility so that if anyone is caught defecating openly he can be  rightly sanctioned.’’
