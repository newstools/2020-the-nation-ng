Our Reporter  A Hip hop act Mr P, has shared an image of two fans that raided his shoe closet for 30 seconds. This was in keeping to a promise he made some weeks ago. On Thursday, Mr P shared an image on Instagram where the fans were standing, clutching the shoes while he was in the middle. “So last week The Raider @johnsnizzofficial came with his friend and raid my closet for 30 seconds,” Mr P said. “Can’t wait to show you guys how its all went down. Chai! see my White louboutin Shoe. Posting Video soon. Who is the Next RAIDER? Guess what the next Raider is Raiding? Trust me it’s a Big One! Wait for it #ZoomRaider.”  Last month, Mr P, who broke away from his twin brother Paul four years ago, took to Twitter to say he looks younger following the split. He had tweeted: “By the way! Did y’all notice that since I went solo, I started ageing backwards; it is called “PEACE OF MIND” and drinking more water and minding my business. Can you beat that? More of it biko. Mr P still trending on twitter.” However, the tweet did not sit well with some of his fans and Mr P blocked them on Twitter.
