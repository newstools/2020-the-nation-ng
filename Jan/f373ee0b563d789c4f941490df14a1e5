Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) is set to name a substantive coach for Super Falcons with the senior national women’s team in race against time for the forthcoming West African Football Union (WAFU) Women’s Cup of Nations to be held in Sierra Leone between February 25 and March 7. Organisers of the sub-regional tournament last week confirmed the new date since the designated hosts, Sierra-Leone Football Association (SLFA) were unable to meet up the earlier December 2019 kick-off date. Speaking on the latest development, NFF scribe Dr. Sanusi Mohammed said effort was being made by the Technical Department to ensure the Super Falcons are called to camp as soon as possible. “The federation is aware of the new date for the WAFU Women’s Cup and we have been contacted by the organisers,” Mohammed told NationSport. “The Technical Department is in charge and I can assure you very soon, the team would be called to camp. “The tournament is not new to us and Sierra Leone has similar wealthier condition with us.  Our girls are experienced and whoever is going to handle the team will give us the best. Sanusi hinted that a new head coach for the Super Falcons will be named by the end of the month by the NFF Technical Committee headed by CAF Technical Committee member Ahmed Yusuf Fresh. He also informed that the federation was finalising the process of recruiting other national team coaches with PricewaterhouseCooper (PwC) Nigeria.
