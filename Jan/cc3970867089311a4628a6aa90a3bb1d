The founder and CEO of Omoshola’s Empire, Deborah Erioluwapo, has emphasised the needs to develop healthy sexual lifestyles. He said they need to enjoy total sexual wellness through massage therapy that will improve the quality of their lives. Erioluwapo, in a statement, explained: “Couples these days take their sexual wellness as seriously as they take their physical appearance too. “Every couple wants a relationship that will thrive in all aspects both outside the bedroom and inside it too.” She said most men and women are no longer content with just sex as a relationship or marital duty that isn’t meant to be enjoyed or savoured. As a result, she stated they are looking for ways to spice up the intimacy between them and heighten the pleasure they derive from being sexually active. She assured Omoshola’s Empire offers all- round wellness services that clients find restful. According to her: “Omoshola’s Empire is to help customers experience and enjoy the benefits of total sexual wellness and massage therapy which includes but is not limited to improved libido and circulation, increased immune efficiency, heightened intimacy pleasure and more. “Appointments for consultations and treatments can be scheduled online on the website or by calling the dedicated customer lines or contacting them via direct messaging on any of their social media pages. Walk in customers are also welcome at their offline offices.”
