 The Lagos State Environmental Sanitation Corps (LAGESC) has started arresting people crossing the highway indiscriminately. This, according to the agency, is to ensure free flow of vehicular movement. A statement yesterday by Adebayo Taofeek, Public Affairs Unit said the Corps Marshal of the agency, CP Gbemisola Akinpelu (rtd) stated this during the monthly interface session with senior officers of the agency at the Command Headquarters, Bolade-Oshodi yesterday. According to her , the agency is focused to attain total compliance on road crossing and use of pedestrian bridges in line with the mandate of the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on the enforcement and prosecution of the offenders”. Akinpelu emphasised on the risks associated with crossing the highways where pedestrian bridges are built, as crossing of highways impede free flow of traffic and unnecessary loss of lives as a result of ”hit and run” motorists. She also said the distance from the pedestrian bridges where arrests can be made by LAGESC officers against erring is pegged at 200 metres. She noted that the Lagos State Government is interested in ensuring that citizens do not endanger their lives by crossing highways and advised them to resort to the usage of pedestrian bridges. She said the agency is currently carrying out the total enforcement in some of the identified areas such as Ikeja Along, Ikorodu Road, Ojota, Berger, C.M.S amongst others. Thirty-six persons, according Mrs. Akinpelu,  have been arrested for prosecution and the exercise will continue and will extends to all part of the state.
