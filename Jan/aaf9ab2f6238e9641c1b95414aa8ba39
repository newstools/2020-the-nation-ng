 Kano High Court on Wednesday fixed January 27 for hearing in the motion on notice filed by some elders seeking an order stopping the implementation of a new law creating four new Emirates in Kano. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the suit, filed by Alhaji Bashir Usman-Tofa and 19 others, is challenging the law that created the four new first class Emirates. The defendants in the suit are: Kano State Governor, Speaker Kano House of Assembly, Kano State House of Assembly, Attorney General of Kano, Tafida Abubakar-Ila, Ibrahim Abdulkadir-Gaya, Dr Ibrahim Abubakar II, Aminu Ado-Bayero and Kano Emirate Council. Justice Nura Sagir fixed the date after counsel to the plaintiffs, A.B. Mahmoud, SAN, prayed the  court for an adjournment because the respondents served them their preliminary objections only last Tuesday at 6.30 p.m. Responding, Attorney-General of Kano and counsel to the respondents, Ibrahim Mukhtar, apologised to the court for not serving their response on time. NAN reports that the plaintiffs under the aegis of “Kano Elders” in their suit, prayed for an interlocutory injunction restraining the respondents or privies from further giving effect to the purported Kano State Emirates Council Law 2019, pending hearing of the motion on notice. They further prayed the court to restrain the first, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eight respondents from convening the councils of chief or taking any steps. They further prayed the court to restrain the Kano State governor and his privies from continuing to give recognition or any decision in any way to the Emirs of Rano, Gaya, Bichi and Karaye.
