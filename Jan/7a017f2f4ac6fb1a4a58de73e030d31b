 AKWA Ibom State projects to make about N100 billion from Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) following its industrialisation drive, it was learnt on Monday. Commissioner for Finance Linus Nkan said the government would leverage on its five functional industries to realise this objective. According to him, the Jubilee Syringe Manufacturing Company; Metering Solutions Manufacturing Company; Kings Flower Mill and Plywood Company and Ibom Airlines were initiated by the government to boost the economy. He hinted that the state’s IGR witnessed a boost in the last two years. Nkan, who did not give the figure, however, said the IGR generated in 2019 was twice that of 2018. He said: “Our efforts to boost the economy have boosted our IGR. That of 2019 was almost double what we got in 2018. We shouldn’t do anything less than N100 billion in 2020. As we are establishing these industries, they will pay tax and employees will also pay taxes to the government.”
