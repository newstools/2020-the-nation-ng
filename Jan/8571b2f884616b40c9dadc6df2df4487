By Dupe Ayinla-Olasunkanmi  Since his 2016 auto accident, much has not been revealed concerning the present condition of veteran actor Victor Olaotan. But all has changed now, following the repost of celebs coming out in a video to seek support to treat the actor. Actress Ihuoma Linda Ejiofor, who refers to the actor as ‘Big Daddy’ lent her voice to the society to come to the aid of the actor. Coming on her Instagram, the actress stated “Victor Olaotan, but to me BIG DADDY.” She said. “We need your Help PLEASE, 0001101396 Stanbic bank Julia Olaotan.” “We all heard the news that gusty morning in October 2016. Victor Olaotan, whom we all called, Big Daddy had been in a near fatal car accident on the way from a movie set. Recalling that morning is still traumatic for all of us. The result of the ghastly car crash has remained truly disheartening for his family of viewers, colleagues and his young children. He loves his children they are growing up without him.  “His wife daily bears the burden of standing in faith. Working with a heart struggling to continue to believe. Yet we can only trust and believe that through you God will raise an army of givers whose drops will quickly become a great ocean that amounts to $250,000 that is required to continue and possibly conclude the treatment of bringing him back to us. We miss the overwhelming presence that he brings to our screens. We miss the aura that only Victor Toye Olaotan has. We miss the effervescence of his art and the timelessness of his craft. Together we can bring BIG DADDY back to his family and to us!!!.” Also actor Seun Ajayi wrote as he shared photos. “Please let’s help Uncle Victor Olaotan get back on his feet.”
