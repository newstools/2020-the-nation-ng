By Emma Elekwa, Onitsha  Spiritual head of Soul Revival Ministry, Okpuno-Egbu, Nnewi, Anambra state, Pastor Iyke Uzukwu on Sunday advised politicians of Igbo extraction to jettison the 2023 presidential ambition. He said it was revealed to him in prophecy that such aspirations would not work. Addressing newsmen after his ministration, the cleric further said it was revealed to him that the travails of former Governor of Abia State, Dr Orji Uzor Kalu was as a result of his ambition to contest for the presidency in 2023. He claimed that any other Igboman who might declare serious ambition for the 2023 presidential race would likely suffer persecution. He said: “Kalu’s case lasted for over ten years and why is it now that Igbo are insisting that the next Nigerian president would come from their zone come 2023 and Kalu was said to have shown interest only to be jailed?” While charging the Igbo to read between the lines and draw a logical conclusion, Uzukwu
also warned that many top politicians across the Southern and Western parts of the country needed prayers to avoid assassination. He further warned that there would be more protests during the year which would be difficult for the presidency to control because of hard times, unless urgent measures were taken to cushion the effect of economic hardship across the country.
