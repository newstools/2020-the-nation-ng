 MIXED reactions on Monday trailed the ban on commercial motorcycles and tricyclists on major highways, bridges and corridors in Lagos State. Lagosians on social media read different meanings to the order, with some accusing the government of insensitivity. Those against the policy felt the government did not take into consideration the frustrating traffic situation in areas such as Apapa, before taking the decision. Uche Fortunate, who claimed he worked at Apapa, said: “Okada ban in Apapa? This seems laughable. Roads in Apapa, from Mile 2 to Warehouse Road, have been bad for years due to the activities of articulated truck operators, who spend almost a month before they can cover a 10-minute drive. How do you expect people to go to work?” Joseph Onyeanu said the government should have first provided alternative means of transportation before the total ban. He wondered what would become of commuters, who would be stranded at bus stops. “It cannot be a right move without measures to cushion the effect of this. There are no sufficient vehicles to convey the many commuters, who will be stranded at bus stops,” Onyeanu said. John Ogunsemore said: “But really, a lot of people will suffer needlessly because of this ban. Many appointments will be missed too, especially in Apapa.” Supporters of the ban said it would reduce accidents and other dangers associated with motorcycling, adding that the menace of the okada riders would also be curtailed.
