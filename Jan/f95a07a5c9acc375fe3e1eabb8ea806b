 BENINESE ace singer Angélique Kidjo won her fourth Grammy award at the 62nd Grammy Award. The ceremony, acclaimed to be world’s most prestigious music honours, held on Sunday night at the Staples Centre in Los Angeles, United States. Nigerian Afro-fusion singer Damini Ogulu, better known as Burna Boy lost the Best World Music Album trophy to Kidjo, whose grandmother is Nigerian. The highly coveted Best World Music Album is an honour presented to recording artists for quality albums in the world music genre at the Grammy. Burna Boy was nominated for the category for his ‘African Giant’ album alongside Altin Gun (Gece), Bokante and Metropole Orkest Conducted By Jules Buckley (What Heat), Nathalie Joachim With Spektral Quartet (Fanm D’ayiti) and Angelique Kidjo (Celia). The Grammy Award nominees are albums containing at least 51 per cent playing time of new vocal or instrumental World Music recordings. Kidjo, now  with her fourth Grammy win overall in the category, is a 59-year-old singer-songwriter, actress and activist noted for her diverse musical influences and creative music videos. She is known for her hit songs “Agolo”, “We We”, “Adouma”, “Wombo Lombo”, “Afirika”, “Batonga” and “Celia”, which clinched the fourth Grammy for her and  was  named “Africa’s premier diva” by Time magazine in 2007. During her acceptance speech, Kidjo dedicated the award to Burna Boy and celebrated a new generation of African artists coming up to represent the continent. “This is for Burna Boy,” she said, lifting up her award to cheers, and declaring the “African Giant” as part of the new generation of African musicians that are changing global perception of Africa and its music. “Four years ago on this stage, I was telling you that the new generations of artists coming from Africa gonna take you by storm and the time has come,” Kidjo said.
