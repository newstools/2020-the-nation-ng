 The police in Bayelsa State have rescued a kidnapped victim, Master Antonio, the six-year-old son of the Commissioner for Water Resources, Nengi Talbot. The little boy was abducted on December 22 by four gunmen, who stormed the commissioner’s home at the New Commissioners’ Quarters in Yenagoa. The gunmen broke into the home of Talbot at the quarters located in Opolo and demanded money from the commissioner. The assailants seized the boy and whisked him away to an unknown place when the commissioner insisted that he had no money. It was, however, gathered that following investigations by the special police crack team, Operation Puff Adder, the boy was freed. Police Commissioner Uche Anozia received the abducted victim at the command’s headquarters in Yenagoa. He said the boy regained freedom following sustained efforts by the police, who were on the trial of the kidnappers. Anozia said the kidnappers moved the victim from one creek to another, adding that the police adopted high level of intelligence and professionalism to free the boy unhurt. He said the suspects were arrested and would undergo further investigations. Talbot thanked the police for their efforts, saying he paid no ransom to get his son back. Describing the experience as traumatic, he said the kidnappers initially demanded N50million, but the police ensured no ransom was paid.
