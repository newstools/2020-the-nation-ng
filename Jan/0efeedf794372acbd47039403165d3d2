Activists under the aegis of Nigerians Unite Against Terror (NUAT) on Monday urged the Federal Government to hasten the release of Leah Sharibu from the hands of her abductors. NUAT Convener Dr Joe Okei-Odumakin made the appeal in a statement in Lagos. The activist expressed worry over reports that Leah Sharibu “has given birth to a baby boy, fathered by a Boko Haram commander”. “It’s not too late to rescue Leah Sharibu, who remains a blight on our collective conscience,” Okei-Odumakin said. The NUAT convener also expressed concern over the recent killing of Rev. Lawan Andimi, the Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in Adamawa State. She urged the government to re-jig its security architecture to address the current security challenges. Okei-Odumakin noted that religious institutions – mosque and churches – which were easy targets of terrorist attacks, be well protected. “We condemn these killings and are worried that despite serial claims by government to have decimated Boko Haram, it continues to inflict maximum damage on the psyche of the country. “We mourn with the families of the killed, just as we call on the government to be more committed in dealing with the menace of Boko Haram,” Okei-Odumakin said. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Leah Sharibu was abducted on the night of February 19, 2018, by Boko Haram terrorists from Government Girls Science and Technical Secondary School in Dapchi, Bursari Local Government Area of Yobe State.
