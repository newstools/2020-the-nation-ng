 Kelechi Iheanacho has warned Leicester City’s teammates not to expect another Southampton stroll. The Foxes equalled the Premier League record with a stunning 9-0 win at St Mary’s in October. But Saints visit the King Power Stadium today having won six of their last nine games in all competitions. “It is football – anything can happen – but I think they’re going to come at us strongly this time,” Iheanacho said. “So we’ve just got to focus on our jobs and the things we’ve got to do and make sure we get the three points. “Obviously we have to look at that side of it as well. We showed our quality at their home, but I think it will be a tough game as well. So we need to focus on getting the three points. Iheanacho netted his sixth goal in eight games this season in Leicester’s 1-1 Carabao Cup semi-final first leg draw with Aston Villa on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Brendan Rodgers has confirmed that Wilfred Ndidi’s knee operation was successful, but the hard tackling midfielder will be out for at least three weeks.
