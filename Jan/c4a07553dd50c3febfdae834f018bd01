The Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Otunba Adeniyi Adebayo on Monday said President Muhammadu Buhari has given the ministry a marching order to drive economic growth, diversify the economy, create jobs and boost export. The minister spoke during a meeting with the leadership of the four unions of the ministry in Abuja,  assured that the ministry as an engine room of the economy is fully ready to embark on intense economic diversification from oil to non-oil, and job creation for the youths. He added that the ministry is contributing to the promise made by Buhari on lifting 100million people out of poverty in the next 10 years, assuring that the ministry is working assiduously towards that direction in achieving that mandate. Full diversification of the economy is key, as this will not only generate revenue but woo investors from different parts of the world to the country thereby making the country a hub for different businesses. With all these, nothing can be achieved if the four unions refuse to resolve their difference and come together as a team to move the ministry forward. The four unions that came together as a team include Association of Senior Civil Servants of Nigeria (ASCSN), Nigeria Civil Service Union (NCSU), Amalgamated Union of Public Corporations Civil Service Technical and Recreational Service (AUPCTRE), as well as Nigerian  Union of Public Service Reportorial Secretarial, Data Processors and Allied Workers (NUPSRAW). Adebayo assured the unions of government support and urged them to work with the Permanent Secretary, Nasir Sani Gwarzo in the area of staff welfare as well as general wellbeing of the staff working in the ministry. Speaking, Sani-Gwarzo assured he will support the minister to achieve his goal by creating an enabling working environment, investing in the welfare and general wellbeing for all the staff. He said he has observed that in spite of all the differences the intension is to move the country forward.
