 The Senior Staff Association of Nigeria Polytechnics (SSANIP) has issued a seven-day ultimatum to the management of the Federal Polytechnic Bida to meet with their demands, failing which its members would down tools. This is coming on the heels of the strike action taken by the Institutionâ€™s Academic Staff Association of Polytechnic (ASUP) which is yet to be called off. The seven-day ultimatum commenced on the 9th of this month and will lapse on the 16th of the month. The strike notice was signed by the chairman of the Union Ruth Bawa and Secretary Salihu Mohammed Almustapha after its congress where the decision was taken after deliberations. Although the association did not give the reason for the ultimatum, but at the peak of the crisis last year, between the School management and ASUP, the Union had called on the School management to resolve the differences it had with ASUP. The Ultimatum is apparently in sympathy with the Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics that has been on strike since November last year. According to the Union, the ultimatum is being given following an order to proceed by the national leadership of the association as they stated that it is in line with the SSANIP constitution. The Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics (ASUP) had demanded the payment of lingering shortfall in salaries of members, non-payment of allowances, the reversal of the secret recruitment of 141 staff without following due process as well as the withdrawal of queries issued to some of its members before they will call off their strike.
