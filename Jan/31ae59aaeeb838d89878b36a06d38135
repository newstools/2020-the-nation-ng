At least two foreign coaches from France and Germany are among the notable names being considered as the next coach of the national women’s team, the Super Falcons. The Super Falcons post is one of the prime positions  being jostle for after the exit of Swede Thomas Dennerby  and other indigenous coaches in the mix include former international and former Falcons assistant coaches, Maureen Mmadu and Ann Chiejinne; with others being past handlers of the  team including Bala Nkiyu, Christopher Danjuma and Edwin Okon. NationSport gathered that the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) is also in receipt of four applications from foreign coaches desirous to replace Gernot Rohr in case the incumbent Super Eagles handler fails to agree terms with NFF for contract extension. “What I can tell you is that all former national team coaches applied for their former positions but the NFF Technical Committee is making consultations and looking at the applications submitted and very soon the successful coaches will be announced. You know we have World Cup qualifiers for the women’s U-17 national team (Flamingoes) in the last week of February and U-20 (Falconets) in March this year,” the source who pleaded anonymity said. However, NFF General Secretary, Sanusi Mohammed, flatly refused to comment on the engagement of national team coaches, saying the technical department along with the consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) has been saddled with the responsibilities of recommending capable hands for vacant national team positions.
