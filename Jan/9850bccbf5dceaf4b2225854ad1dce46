Kwara State Police Command on Wednesday paraded 18 suspected criminals, including a kidnapper, a murderer and land grabbers in Ilorin. Commissioner Kayode Egbetokun said that the suspected kidnapper, Adamu Alhaji Bawa and the suspected murderer, Jamiu Sulaiman, relocated from Katsina and Lagos states after allegedly committing the crime. He alleged that Jamiu connived with others to kill his friend, out of envy, adding that he collected his lorry and relocated to Ilorin from Lagos State. Egbetokun said the suspected kidnapper, Adamu Alhaji Bawa, was an indigene of Katsina State, who, he said, ran to Tsaragi town, Kwara State, for cover after he committed the alleged crime. He said that 16 suspected land grabbers were arrested at Egbejila community in Ilorin West Local Government for allegedly disturbing public peace, after a disagreement on land ownership. The police commissioner, who said nobody died, added that the suspects attacked a policeman with a machete, who was at the area to discharge his duty. However, the suspects alleged that a group of people, led by a resident of Osere community, attacked them in a bid to take over their land. Egbetokun said that the suspects would be arraigned after investigation.
