Our Reporter  Dean of Student Affairs Usmanu Dan Fodiyo University, Sokoto (UDUS) Prof Aminu Mode, has said there is no going back on the recent hike in hostel accommodation and introduction of sundry fees by the institution. It will be recalled that the university had increased accommodation fees from N 7,090 to N10,090 for students staying in the hostel and also introduced Tertiary Health Insurance Program charges for all students of the institution. Mode made this known during a stakeholders meeting with student leaders initiated by the management to explain reasons  for the action. According to Mode, despite the increments, UDUS still remains one of the few institutions that charges lowest  hostel fees. “When the review of hostel fee came up at our meeting, I requested from the management to allow me hold meeting with the student leaders.  Then, few students were present because many were on break. The amount we agreed on was N10, 990 and which the vice chancellor approved. Even if you take a look at hostel charges of some other universities, you will realise that UDUS still charge lesser,” he said. Mode also added that the purpose of increment was to boost the maintenance of all university hostels and address accommodation problems for students. He continued: “It’s not possible for the university to accommodate all students. We have more than 27,000 students; yet about 7,000 students that stay in hostel cannot be fully accommodated. That’s why when you go to Bakassi hostels, you will see that some piece of land has been cleared, the school has intended to build hostels there.” “The school does not have money. Those buildings you see around the school premises were being funded by TETFUND (Tertiary Education Tax Fund); that’s why the management resolved that private owners will be given pieces of land around the school stadium upon meeting the standard and requirements by the school.
