Our Reporter  THE  Board of Trustees and Management of Fountain University has appointed Chairman, Jaiz Bank Plc, Dr. Umaru Mutallab, as the new Chancellor of the University. Mutallab’s conferment was held during the university’s ninth convocation at the school auditorium in Osogbo, Osun State. The board had earlier announced Mutallab as Chancellor during a  visit to his Abuja office by the executive of NASFAT and management of the university last year. Speaking during the convocation, Mutallab said he was honoured,  promising to deploy his wealth of experience and resources to foster the growth and development of the institution.  He said: “This is indeed the right moment for me to publicly acknowledge the honour accorded me. I consider this a privilege to serve my dear community and humanity. It comes to me after a modest five-decade career in the corporate world, and at a time that a retiree of my age is willing to commit more of his energies to charity and every possible way of pleasing the Almighty. I consider this a call to serve the young generation of youths to whom we all owe a duty of facilitating a brighter, prosperous and rewarding future.’’ The President, NASFAT Worldwide, Alhaji Niyi Yusuff appreciated the chancellor for accepting the offer, stressing the institution is lucky to have such a prominent personality with wisdom, networks, and resources on the school’s board.
