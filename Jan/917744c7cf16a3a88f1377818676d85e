Governor Babagana Umara Zulum on Tuesday was at Jakana and Mainok towns, located on Maiduguri-Damaturu highway to reassure their residents. Both towns had come under threats from Boko Haram early this week. In both places, the Governor encouraged the people on the need to take security measures seriously. He urged the residents to be vigilant and report any suspicious persons or movement to the army and any other security officials they can reach. Zulum strongly warned that anyone aiding criminal activities will be made to face the full wrath of the law. He also said that the state and federal governments will work together to make sure there is no compulsive basis to relocate more than 30,000.
