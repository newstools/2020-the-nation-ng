Our Reporter  INSPIRED to connect Africa through music, singer and songwriter Swagga Don believes that his new album, ‘Mother Africa’, will unite the continent, even in the face of xenophobia. Speaking recently in Lagos, Swagga Don, who is also a producer, said: “With Africans spread all over the world, we need a unifying force to connect the Africans in the diaspora and music and culture is the tool.” He said that his mission is to fuse music of African origin to appeal to the world.  “So, in the album coming “Mother Africa” you have reggae Makosa, the first track is a mixture of Soucos, contemporary African music, Makossa and all that embodies the fusion of Africans as a people,” said the artiste who is managed by Majek Fashek’s manager, Uzoma ‘Day’ Omenka. Swagga Don, who is also called Avatar and Spirit of Africa said he is inspired by the need to produce long-lasting music. “Inspiration is God-given. If it is not ‘throwaway’ music, it’s inspired. Music is message and musicians are messengers. Our great singers and songwriters have been inspired one way or the other.”
