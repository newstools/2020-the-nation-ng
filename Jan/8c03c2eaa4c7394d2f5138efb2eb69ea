These are not the best of times for the Minister of Power, Sale Mamman. Twice within two weeks did he suspend a subordinate and twice was his decision reversed by the Presidency. First was the minister’s suspension of the Managing Director of the Rural Electrification Agency (REA), Damilola Ogunbiyi, which the Presidency reversed via a tweet in which it explained that President Muhammadu Buhari had accepted Ogunbiyi’s resignation to enable her take up an appointment with the United Nations Organisation (UN). The reversal of Ogunbiyi’s suspension was followed by President Buhari’s reversal of Mamman’s dismissal of the boss of the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Company Limited (NBET), Marilyn Amobi. Findings made by Sentry, however, revealed that the Minister lost out in the power game at the Presidential Villa because he drew the ire of the fabled cabal in the Buhari administration with a statement he issued alleging that the sacked bosses of REA and NBET were members of the cabal. Members of the said cabal were said to have been peeved that Mamman, who himself is a beneficiary of the cabal, could turn round to taunt them, hence their decision to show him the red flag. At press time, the minister was battling for survival because the ‘cabal’ was said to be out for a fight-to-the-finish. Already, he has lost the control of NBET to the Minister of Finance, Hajiya Zainab Ahmed. But will he also lose his office? Only time will tell.
