Jigawa State Police Command arrested 32 armed robbery suspects and four kidnapped suspects last year. Commissioner Usman Sule Gomna, briefing reporters on Monday in Dutse, said: “Between January and December last year, the command recorded 54 culpable homicide cases. “In the year under review, the command received 61 rape cases and one child stealing case.” He said that the command received 28 theft cases “an all the 32 armed robbers and 28 theft suspects were charged to court.” Gomna said that 119 fatal accidents were recorded, adding: “Eighteen people were arrested for breach of public peace and unrest last year. “As you’re aware, I am barely one and a half month old in the state, but I have had enough briefs from my predecessor and officers on ground to prepare me fully for the challenges of tackling crimes, especially the ones peculiar to the state. “On my assumption of office and assessment of the crime situation on ground, particularly in the rural areas where crime is pronounced, I evolved intelligence-driven crime combating strategies. “All the strategies were tested and proven to be effective, and have thus given us substantial progress and success within the short period of my leadership.” He said that the effort of the government and other sister agencies in collaborating with the police in fighting crime could not be overemphasised. Gomna said the police had adopted community policing as one of the most effective ways of crime control, noting that communities would be engaged in dialogue to resolve civil cases out of court.
