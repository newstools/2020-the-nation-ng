Russia’s Maria Sharapova will compete at the Brisbane International this month after receiving a wildcard. The 32-year-old former world number one played just 15 matches in 2019 because of a long-term shoulder injury. Five-time Grand Slam champion Sharapova last played a competitive match in the first round of the US Open in August. “Brisbane, I’ve missed you and I’m so excited to be starting off my year 2020 at your tournament, in your city,” Sharapova said in a social media video. “I’ve missed the fans, I’ve missed the event so much, and I am so looking forward to seeing everyone.
