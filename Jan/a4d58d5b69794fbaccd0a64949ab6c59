 OYO State Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) Mr Mutiu Agboke, has said the continuous voter registration will start soon. Agboke spoke on Tuesday at a stakeholders’ meeting in Iseyin. He said the exercise would capture new registrants and those that have issues with their Permanent Voter’s Cards (PVCs), such as replacement of lost or defaced cards and transfers from former locations. The REC said no fewer than 700,000 PVCs were still in the custody of the commission. Agboke implored political leaders to start sensitising their members and supporters on the need to obtain the PVC, saying the card was the only requirement for voting. The REC also warned leaders of political parties to start educating their members to refrain from violence and violation of electoral laws. “Also, politicians who have plan to contest for political positions in 2023 should start to familiarise themselves with their constituents rather than wait till the last minute to impose themselves. “Year 2023 looks as if it is far but it is not. That is the reason the INEC is making early preparation, such as the stakeholders’ meeting we are holding now, to engage all stakeholders on how to improve our electoral processes,” he said. Agboke also admonished political parties to follow electoral laws and guidelines while conducting party primaries. A member of the House of Representatives, representing Iseyin, Itesiwaju, Kajola and Iwajowa Federal Constituency, Shina Peller, said inadequacies in the nation’s electoral system had contributed to the challenges in conducting elections in the country. He called for electoral reform that would proffer solutions to the challenges.
