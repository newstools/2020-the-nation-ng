Anthony Joshua would be willing to accept a 50-50 split of the fight purse to set up a bout with the winner of Deontay Wilder and Tyson Fury fight, according to promoter Eddie Hearn. Fury and Wilder will lock horns on February 22 and Joshua will be keen to face the winner to give himself a shot at becoming the first undisputed heavyweight champion since the turn of the century. Hearn told Sky Sports, as per The Sun: “We have to try and make that happen. “Right now, the fight that Anthony Joshua wants is the winner of Wilder and Fury. We’ve been there before. Both guys have turned down 60-40 for that fight and now we have no other option, but to offer them 50-50, because the fight will never happen, subject to the boss giving the thumbs up, which I think he knows that’s the way to make this fight. Hearn also confirmed that any fight would be likely to take place in Saudi Arabia after the success of Joshua’s ‘Clash on the Dunes’ against Andy Ruiz Jr. “We have a huge site offer in place for that fight to take place. A big option. We have a partnership out there in Saudi Arabia. “They put the money up for the Andy Ruiz fight. Everything they promised, they delivered. They want this fight bad and when they’ve got that kind of attitude and mentality, it’s going to be difficult to beat.”
