The Senate will, on resumption of plenary on Tuesday, January 28, 2020, constitute its penal on the review of the 1999 Constitution, The Nation learnt on Thursday. Chairman of the Senate Committee on Media and Public Affairs, Godiya Akwashiki, broke the news yesterday in Abuja. He said Senate President Ahmad Lawan had given his word that the committee would be constituted on resumption of the Senate from the Christmas and New Year break. Akwashiki described Constitution amendment as very important, considering that various sections of the country were clamouring for a review of the nation’s laws to tackle insecurity and other social and economic challenges. Many senators across party lines are also known to be agitating for the immediate composition of the panel on Constitution Review. Some of the senators are said to have sponsored Bills aimed at amending sections of the Constitution. The composition of the Constitution Review panel would, no doubt, be a welcome development to them. Akwashiki said: “The Senate President has promised to address the issue of Constitution Amendment when we resume from our current break. “I believe that he will honour his word by announcing the committee once we resume because of the enormous work it is supposed to handle. “There are issues that needed to be addressed by amendment to the Constitution. Hence the committee is very important to us in the Senate.” Top on the agenda of the constitution review panel include: Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (Alteration) Bill, 2019 (SB. 109), Senator Babba Kaita Ahmad (Katsina North).
