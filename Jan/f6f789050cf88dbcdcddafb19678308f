LUCAS AJANAKU  Market analysts predict that interest in IOT will increase in the Middle East and Africa (MEA) region, with revenue expected to more than double by 2023, reaching an expected value of over $20-billion. This is according to the Telco IOT Offerings and Market Opportunity Assessment in AME report released by global market analysis firm GlobalData. The report suggests the MEA region will be the second fastest growing region for IOT revenue, second behind the Asia-Pacific. While it is acknowledged that the technology is in its early stages of uptake across a number of vertical markets, utilities, government and manufacturing have been identified as the main drivers behind the revenue growth.  A statement by GlobalData quotes Houda Bostanji, EMEA Telecoms Director at GlobalData, said: “IOT expenditure in the region reflects the Gulf Cooperation Council’s (GCC’s) primary investment areas. With some of the most high-profile smart city programs, government and transportation, spend is high. There is a commonality across leading vertical industries, such as government, utilities and manufacturing in many regions. These verticals account for significant spend, which is expected to continue throughout the forecast period.’’
