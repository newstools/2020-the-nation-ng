Damisi Ojo, Akure  The Founder of Sotitobire Miracle Centre, Prophet Alfa Babatunde will remain in detention of Olokuta Correctional Service facility (formerly known as Prisons) in Akure pending the issuance of hearing notice on a case of Kidnapping of one-year-old Boy, Gold Kolawole. The case was filed against him and five other members of his church. The Sotitobire Church founder was docked before an Ondo state Magistrate court sitting at Oke-Eda Akure alongside five of his church members on a six -count-charge of alleged felony, conspiracy and Kidnapping of the boy, Gold Kolawole inside the church on 10th November, last year.  The court presided over by Mrs Charity Adeyanju however gave an order that Prophet Babatunde should remain in prison pending the time the State High Court will issue the hearing notice, where his bail application could be taken. Magistrate Adeyanju had earlier restricted Journalists from covering the session. No reason was given for her action.
