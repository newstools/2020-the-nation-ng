 CHAIRMAN, Senate Committee on Army, Senator Mohammed Ali Ndume, has called on the authorities of the Nigerian Army to redeploy additional troops to Maiduguri in order to beef up security in the area. Ndume, in a statement in Abuja, noted that two women on suicide mission detonated bombs on Sunday in a mosque located in Bulabulum ward in Gworza town within his senatorial district of Borno state. He said that according to the account of the Brigade Commander in the area, the two women slipped into the mosque pretending to be there for early morning (Subuhi) prayer. “They detonated the bombs simultaneously leaving two people dead and 12 others severely injured, with the mosque razed. Because the people were alerted early enough, the casualty was, however, minimised,” he said. He said, “The Nigerian Army thereafter swung into action, cordoning off the mosque and stepping up patrol of the area as well as mounting road blocks to search motorists to prevent further explosions. “However, I wish to call on the military to step up security in the area, just as I enjoined the Gworza people to be more vigilant, cooperate with the military and also supply information to them, in order to forestall re-occurrence of the suicide attack. “I wish to also call on the federal government to strengthen the military by ensuring that the Chadian forces which were withdrawn recently are returned “It has become necessary for the Army to redeploy more soldiers to Maiduguri-Damaturu road which has been notorious for Boko Haram and kidnapping in the recent days. “That road used to be saver and it is the only outlet linking Maiduguri to other states in the country,” Ndume said.
