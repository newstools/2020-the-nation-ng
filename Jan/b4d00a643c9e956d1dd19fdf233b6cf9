Gunmen suspected to be assassins on Wednesday killed a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Oyo State, Alhaji Babatunde Oreitan. Oreitan, one of the leaders of the party in Ona Ara Local Government, was reportedly killed by the gunmen yesterday afternoon. Sources said the APC chieftain was murdered in his house at Oremeji Agugu, Ibadan. Although details of his death were sketchy, it was  gathered that the APC chieftain was murdered after Dhur prayer in a mosque located in his house. Efforts to get the reaction of police spokesman Mr. Olugbenga Fadeyi proved abortive, as calls put to his line were not successful. But, the Deputy National Youth Leader of the party, Afeez Mobolaji Repete, confirmed the killing in a post. Repete, a former special adviser to ex-governor Abiola Ajimobi on Youths and Students Matters, described the deceased as a devout Muslim. He said: “The leader of APC in Ona Ara Local Government, Alhaji Babatunde Oreitan, has been murdered. “Alhaji Oreitan, you were a principled politician, a devout Muslim and a political leader. “Those who killed you will never have peace. Rest in peace Baba Gbemisola, Baba Lateef.”
