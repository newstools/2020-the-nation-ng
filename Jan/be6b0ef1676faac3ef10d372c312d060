Popular fashion entrepreneur, Temi Otedola, took to her Instagram handle @jtofashion to share a photo celebrating her three-year-old relationship with lover, Eazi. The shared photo by Temi shows the couple `loved-up’ in a lovey-dovey mood with Mr Eaz, placing a soft kiss on her shoulder while she stares at him. Unlike other celebrities, who tend to show off their glamorised writing skills during celebrations like this, the billionaire’s daughter only went straight to point to caption the photo with “3 years”. This act has been said not to be the first time the couple had taken to their social media platforms to share photos of their lovelife. Back in 2019, Temi took to her Instagram handle @jtofashion where she shared a post about the surprise gift she gave her boyfriend and music star, Mr Eazi. According to Temi, when she started dating Eazi, she realised that he was a huge fan of Andrea Bocelli, so she decided to get him tickets to go watch him perform live. Evidently delighted by her kind gesture, Eazi took to her Instagram comment section where he professed his undying love for her. In 2019, Mr Eazi took to his Instagram handle @mreazi where he shared a photo of Temi and himself as they enjoy their vacation in Greek Island, where they both had a wonderful time together. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Mr Eazi gained international audience following the release of the Efya-assisted single “Skin Tight” NAN also reports that Temi Otedola is a fashion blogger and social media personality, who rose to fame with her excellent sense of clothing and wardrobe style. Temi was born in Nigeria on March 20, 1996, to Femi Otedola and Nana Otedola. (NAN)
