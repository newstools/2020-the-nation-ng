Basketball legend Kobe Bryant has died in a helicoper crash in Calabasas Sunday morning ,TMZ Sports has confirmed. Kobe was traveling with at least three other people in his private helicopter when it went down. A fire broke out before emergency personnel responded but nobody on board survived. It was gathered Vanessa Bryant was not among those on board. The cause of the crash is under investigation. Kobe has famously used a helicopter to travel for years — dating back to when he played for the Lakers. He was known for commuting from Newport Beach, CA to the STAPLES Center
in DTLA in his Sikorsky S-76 chopper. KB is survived by his wife Vanessa, and their four daughters — Gianna, Natalia and Bianca and their newborn Capri. Kobe has recently been spotted out at NBA games with his daughter Gianna — a rising star basketball player herself. Their youngest daughter, Capri, was just born in June 2019. Kobe is widely considered one of the greatest NBA players of all time — making 18 All-Star teams during his 20 year career with the Lakers. He was a first-round pick in the 1996 draft,
winning 5 NBA championships, 2 NBA Finals MVPs and he was the league MVP in ’08. The Lakers famously retired both of Kobe’s jerseys, number 8 and 24 … the only player in the team history to receive that honor.
Kobe’s accomplishments stand far outside of the basketball world. He won an Oscar for his short film, “Dear Basketball,” in 2018.
