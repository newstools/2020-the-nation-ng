The Nigeria national men handball team lost to Olympique Souliman of Tunisia 23-21 on Wednesday in a preparatory friendly match in the city of Sulayman, Tunisia ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations. The Nigerian team lost out to the Tunisian Top flight handball team as they continue to work hard ahead of the Nations Cup which begins on January 16. The team had earlier played Morocco in another friendly tie. Despite the latest setback, Technical Director of the Handball Federation of Nigeria (HFN) Ferdinand Emeana is optimistic that the team will get better after acclimatising well with the weather and assured the team were having the best preparation for the continental championship which also serve as a qualifier for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. He also revealed that Nigeria would certainly play two more friendly matches against Cameroon today and DR Congo tomorrow.
