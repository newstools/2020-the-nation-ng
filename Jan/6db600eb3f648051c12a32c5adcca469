 Ogun State government on Wednesday said that there is no confirmed case of Lassa Fever in the State. The Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) erroneously listed Ogun as one of the affected states. But reacting, the Commissioner for Health, Dr. Tomi Coker, in a release, said there is no case of confirmed Lassa Fever in Ogun, adding that government had however put its health officials on red alert in the event of a suspected case. Coker therefore allays the fear of residents of the State, advising them to avoid contact with rodents and ensure personal as well as environmental hygiene. Describing Lassa Fever as an endemic acute viral hemorrhage illness that is transmitted from rodents to human, and human to human, the Commissioner advised health workers across the state to maintain a high index of suspicions for Lassa and treat all cases of fever symptoms with caution. She added that all suspected cases of Lassa Fever should be reported to the Local Government Area Disease Surveillance Notification Officer (DSNO) or call 09099140121 and 09099140122.
