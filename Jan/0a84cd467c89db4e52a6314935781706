A professional body, Nigerian Institution of Civil Engineers (NICE), Osun State chapter, has advocated for knowledge transfer through mentoring in both the private and public sectors to upcoming engineers. Elders of the body, who spoke separately at the 6th Public Lecture and Award Presentation of the Nigerian Institution of Civil Engineers (NICE) in Osogbo, Osun State capital, said knowledge transfer would go a long way in bridging the gaps being recorded in the profession. They also blamed the decay in infrastructure and spate of building collapse on poor maintenance culture, corruption and use of sub-standard materials for construction. At the event, some of their distinguished members, including the Commissioner for Works in Osun State, Oluremi Omowaiye, the national vice president of the Nigerian Society of Engineers and Special Adviser to Osun State Governor, Felix Ibitoye, and the Commissioner for Special Duties, Olalekan Badmus, were given awards of honour. A retired Permanent Secretary for Works in the state, David Olusola Oni, who acknowledged that good maintenance culture is germane to sustainability and development. He said that decay and deficit in infrastructure had retarded the nation’s growth by making Nigeria unattractive to local and foreign investments. He therefore charged those in authorities to imbibe the spirit of maintenance culture to bring a desired change to the country. However, he said the poor quality of construction materials was not solely responsible for building collapse, adding that the experience input in handling the projects and how professional the company involved is must not be overlooked.
