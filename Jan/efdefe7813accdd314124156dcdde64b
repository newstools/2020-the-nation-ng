Our Reporter  Nigerian Correctional facility in Ikoyi, Lagos last week received an unusual guest as a Lagos Magistrate Court order the detention of an old man, Tunde Kekere-Ekun, popularly known as “Baba Orobo – the Night Climber.” The suspect was arrested in the wee hours of January 20 while carrying out the nefarious activity that has earned him the name “the Night Climber.” His arrest was made possible while illegally reconnecting EKEDC debtor-customers at Rockville Estate, Badore. Luck, however, ran out of the 62-year-old “night climber” as he was sighted by the estate’s Chief Security Officer at the top of an electricity pole trying to illegally carry out his operation. It was gathered that the estate’s security detained Mr Kekere-Ekun before contacting Eko Distribution Company that then informed the Police about the incident.  Due to Kekere-Ekun’s age, he was granted bail on light terms and remanded at Ikoyi prison pending the perfection of his bail in the sum of N20,000 and one surety. EKEDC spokesperson, Godwin Idemudia, in an official statement praised Badore community for their help and encouraged other communities to follow their example. He stated that the company and customers are both after the goals of improving power supply and 100 per cent customer satisfaction hence their cooperation is imperative in order to achieve this drive. Idemudia went further to advise all who engage in such acts to desist forthwith or face the full wrath of the law.
