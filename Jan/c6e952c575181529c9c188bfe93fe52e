Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State alleged on Saturday that some political forces were plotting to  hijack the state during the 2023 elections. But he vowed that such plots would not come to fruition. Speaking at the  funeral service for a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic party (PDP) in the state, Dr.Ferry Gberegbe ,Wike challenged the people of the state to get ready to defend their votes during those elections. Gberegbe ,the PDP agent in Khana Local Government area during the 2019 governorship election was allegedly killed by FSARS operatives  at the Bori collation centre during the polls. Paying tribute to the deceased,Wike said: “”He (Gberegbe) did not die because of sickness; he did not die because he was doing something illegal. He died in defence of our votes. The only crime he committed was to defend our votes. ‘’It is only in this part of the country that you defend your votes and they say that you have committed an offence. Our friend and brother is gone, but he paid the price for democracy to survive in Nigeria. ‘’He paid for democracy to survive in Rivers State. As for those of us who have that spirit, he has laid the foundation for the defence of democracy.” Continuing,he said: “I heard someone say two days ago, somebody in China told somebody in Port Harcourt that what happened in Imo State, that is what they will do in 2023. “They said they will write results and the court will accept the results. I said Rivers State is a different state. If you write results, you face the consequences. I am not worried because these people are always boasting. “In 2015, they said nobody would be governor; somebody became governor. In 2019, we will see what will happen and you will not even see electoral material, but today, we are governor. ‘’Now, to give their people hope, they are talking of 2023. As a result of this young man, they will not see the Government House in 2023.”
