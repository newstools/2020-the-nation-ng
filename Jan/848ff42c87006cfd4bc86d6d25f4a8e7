Mrs. Bola Adeeko has claimed that she never knew that the concoction served her, which she ate, was prepared with Miss Favour Daley-Oladele’s heart, breasts and other vital organs. She said that she even vomited hours after eating the strange preparation by Pastor Segun Philip. The woman told reporters at Eleweran, the headquarters of the Ogun State Police Command, while being paraded by the police with her son, Owolabi and Pastor Philip that the duo (Owolabi  and Pastor Philip), deceived her into believing that the concoction was prepared with goat organs. She also denied knowing or participating in the killing of Favour, lamenting that she was touched as a mother that someone’s daughter could be slaughtered and her organs used to prepare a delicacy, which she unknowingly ate. Mrs. Adeeko, however, admitted that she went to Pastor Philip for solution to her financial problems, saying that she paid the pastor N200,000:00 to carry out the rites to redeem her from poverty and persistent business failure.
