They were arraigned by the Police Special Fraud Unit (PSFU), Ikoyi, Lagos, on August 22, 2019 before Justice Nicholas Oweibo, The PSFU, in a charge marked FHC/L/292c/19, alleged that the defendants committed the offences while operating under the names of Regis Bureau De Change, Jayjibs Ventures, Johim Ventures and Jajibs Bureau-De-Change.
