Niger Governor Abubakar Bello has deployed land and air surveillance by security personnel to the affected community attacked by bandits in the early hours of Saturday. The security agencies have been directed to fish and flush out the bandits terrorising the communities. The Governor, who condemned the renewed banditry attacks on Kudodo, Nakpala, and Gulapai communities of Shiroro Local Government Area, said that stringent military action would henceforth be taken to bring an end to the persistent attacks in the state. The Governor, who lamented that the bandits are taking advantage of the vastness and difficult terrain of the forestland to unleash terror on innocent people, stated that the state government is fully supporting the joint security task force to chase the armed bandits out of the state. While sympathising with victims of the recent armed banditry attacks in the affected communities, Bello called for calm appealing to them to cooperate with and assist security agencies by providing credible intelligence reports that will uncover the hideout of the bandits.
