The discovery of the dead body of Amos forced the neighbours to report to the palace of the ward head who took the matter to the police, who in turn traced the father to his house in Bachure, a community separated from Ali’s Damilu by a major street. He said they called her line later on Sunday but it was not going through, informing since that day, they heard nothing from her until four days later when a police officer came and informed him of her death. Sources suggest that Ali Wakil is a hardened man who went about his normal life even as the body of his girlfriend, with whom he is said to have been together for a long time, was in his room decaying. He was said to have been seen even near the home of the girlfriend’s father at Bachure a number of times.
