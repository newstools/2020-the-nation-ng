By Okorie Uguru  1.5 billion international tourist arrivals were recorded in 2019, globally. A four per cent increase on the previous year which is also forecast for 2020, confirming tourism as a leading and resilient economic sector, especially in view of current uncertainties. By the same token, these calls for such growth to be managed responsibly so as to best seize the opportunities tourism can generate for communities around the world. According to the first comprehensive report on global tourism numbers and trends of the new decade, the latest UNWTO World Tourism Barometer, this represents the tenth consecutive year of growth. All regions saw a rise in international arrivals in 2019. However, uncertainty surrounding Brexit, the collapse of Thomas Cook, geopolitical and social tensions and the global economic slowdown all contributed to a slower growth in 2019, when compared to the exceptional rates of 2017 and 2018.  This slowdown affected mainly advanced economies and particularly Europe and Asia and the Pacific. Looking ahead, growth of three per cent to four per cent is predicted for 2020, an outlook reflected in the latest UNWTO Confidence Index which shows a cautious optimism: 47 per cent  of participants believe tourism will perform better and 43 per cent  at the same level of 2019. Major sporting events, including the Tokyo Olympics, and cultural events such as Expo 2020 Dubai are expected to have a positive impact on the sector.
