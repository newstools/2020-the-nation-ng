 WITH a view to ending the continued bloody rivalry between supporters of Kano Pillars and Katsina United, the League Management Company (LMC) has ruled that subsequent Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) matches between Kano Pillars and Katsina United will be played without fans until both clubs and other stakeholders reach an understanding that will guarantee peaceful behaviour of the fans and respect for public order during the matches. As part of steps to put an end to the unhealthy rivalry, the LMC has also elected to supervise meetings and engagements between Katsina United and Kano Pillars management and their respective supporters clubsâ€™ leadership to discuss the persistent rivalry between the two clubs fans with the objective of curtailing any future occurrences of breaches and ensure peaceful engagement between the two clubs. Katsina United were fined N3.5million for various offences while Pillars were fined N1.2million. Both clubs are required, within 48 hours of the date of the notice, to either submit in writing to the summary jurisdiction and the sanctions or elect to be dealt with by a Commission.
