 LEADER of a faction of the Pan-Yoruba socio-political group — Afenifere— Chief Reuben Fasoranti on Thursday berated the Federal Government for declaring Amotekun illegal. Speaking with reporters at his Ijapo residence in Akure, the Ondo State capital, the Afenifere leader hailed the Southwest governors for inaugurating the security outfit. He said: “Operation Amotekun is a welcome development, but they were being asked not to do it. The Governor of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu, insists that they would do it. “I want them to go ahead and do it in the interest of our people; we cannot leave ourselves here, and be helpless in the face of incessant onslaught. He observed that the silence of the Presidency on the matter meant they were behind the minister’s pronouncement. He urged the South-West governors to continue with the plan, saying  they should not be intimidated by the federal government’s pronouncement. The Afenifere leader said it would be illogical to leave the people helpless without any protection.
