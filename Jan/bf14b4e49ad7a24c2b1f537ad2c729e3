By Akinola Ajibade  The National grid on Thursday experienced its first collapse in 2020, resulting in power outage across the country. This is the eleventh time, the country is experiencing grid cocountry, in a spate of thirteen months. In 2019 alone, the county witnessed collapse of its grid ten times, following major faults discovered in many of the electricity sub-stations in the country. The system was said to have collapsed on yesterday afternoon, a development, which has resulted in power failure in some parts of the country. The development, was confirmed in a message sent by Eko Electricity Distribution Company(EKEDC). The message reads:”Power outage affecting all is Transmission Company of Nigeria(TCN) System Disturbance on the grid. Power to be restored soon.  The outage,which occurred last night was due to TCN System Collapse, affecting Lekki, Ibeju and environs. TCN’s Spokeswoman, Mrs Ndidi Mbah, when contacted, said only a section of the country was affected by the issue. According to her, there was no grid collapse in the real sense of it. Mbah said: ” What really happened was that the country experienced  a system disturbance. The issue did not affect most parts of the country. Even, electricity supply has been restored in Abuja and TCN is working hard to restore supply in other affected areas. It takes a whole lot of time to rectify issues that are affecting the grid and hopefully, things would comeback to normalcy soon.
