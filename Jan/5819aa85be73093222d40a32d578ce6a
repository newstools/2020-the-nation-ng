Our Reporter  Zambia hip hop artiste Jack Lumbeta Kafukwilwa, also known as Jay Trigga, is relishing his collaboration with Davido’s DMW rapper Dremo. According to the artiste, “one of my most memorable accomplishments among many that is very special to me is when I heard Dremo wanted to do a remix of my song. What makes this one a major one for me is because I have always been a fan of his.” Jay Trigga has also featured another Nigerian artiste, Ice Prince, on his song: Money. He thinks highly of the Afrobeat genre, and fancies Wizkid and Burna Boy. “I regard Wizkid and Burna Boy as my role models, they took Africa to the world in their own way, so I look up to them. I hope to have the same impact with my music,” he gushes. Tracing his interest in music, he said: “I always loved music. My father played a lot of music around and my mother hosted a few of the coolest parties in her community where I usually performed as the DJ. Music always surrounded me but when I saw Kanye West make beats and rap on them, I got inspired and started producing my own music.  However, I was still a little shy on the microphone until I came across Nasty C, whose success as a young artiste built my confidence. ‘’Seeing him as a young artist like me made me believe in myself. Now, music and I are inseparable because I breathe, live, talk and walk music.” Born in Solwezi, Zambia, Jay Trigga spent most of his childhood in Kitwe, Zambia, till secondary school where he relocated to the capital city, Lusaka. He recalls: “Childhood was fine. I lived in between places as my parents are divorced, so I lived in between the Copperbelt Province and Lusaka Province. I graduated high school from Pemba Secondary Province in 2014 and graduated from Liaoning Shihua University in China 2019 with a Bachelor’s degree in Petroleum Engineering.”
