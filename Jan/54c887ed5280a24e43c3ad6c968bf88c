By LUCAS AJANAKU  Smartphone manufacturer, Vivo, said it will consolidate its market this year having done so well last year. It said having started the year on a high note in the local market and across other mobile phone markets globally, it is bent on consolidating on its achievments and scaling it further this year through innovation, design, partnerships, consumers satisfaction and engagement. A statement recalled that last July, Vivo ventured into the local market with its Y series (Y15, Y17, Y11, Y12, Y90) and a few weeks later, it unveiled its flagship product – the V17Pro. “Despite being new in the market, it is worthy of note that the brand was able to sell all the devices that were shipped into the country in record time.  The reason for its successisnot far-fetched – Vivo, is a premium mobile phone brand with its unique selling points being its innovativeness, strength and fascinating aesthetics. “Vivo prides itself as the first smartphone brand to launch the in-display fingerprint sensor on a smartphone. The feat came at a time when the industry standard was having the sensor either at the rear of the device or on the home button. Also, its V7 and V7plus devices, which were launched at the Mobile World Congress were the first smartphones to spot an elevating 24MP front camera from APEX,” the statement added.
