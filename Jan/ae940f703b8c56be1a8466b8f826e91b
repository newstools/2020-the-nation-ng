 THE Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) has extended the deadline for the verification of contractors and consultants till February 7. Only 770 out of the 2,500 companies have been verified so far. NDDC’s alternate Chairman of the Contract Verification Committee, Dr Emmanuel Audu-Ohwavborua, announced the extension. He said: “The Chairman of the Contract Verification Committee, Cairo Ojougboh, has directed that we let the people of the Niger Delta know that the management of NDDC has graciously approved an extension of one week for the exercise from February 3 to February 7, 2020. “We urge all contractors that have businesses with NDDC that are still ongoing to use the opportunity of the one-week extension to come for documentation. “We have been receiving a series of messages from contractors pleading for extension of time for the exercise so that everyone concerned will be captured. “For instance, in our database in River State, we have about 2,500 contractors and suppliers, but as at today (yesterday), we have captured and processed the documents of just 770 companies.” The alternate chairman warned that any contactor that fails to be captured in the exercise would be deemed not to have any business with NDDC.
