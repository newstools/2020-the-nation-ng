BARCELONA are planning to intervene in Liverpool and Real Madrid transfer plans for Lille striker Victor Osimhen. Reports claim that Barcelona are thinking about the Nigerian striker, Osimhen, as a long-term center-forward replacement for Luis Suarez as the youngster has displayed immense potential to grow. Express Sport claims that Lille are prepared to sell their starlet but only in the summer transfer window, which could prove to be perfect for Barca as they have decided to refrain from making any January transfers. The Nigerian international moved to the French side in July 2019 for a transfer fee of  £10.8 million from Charleroi, a Belgian football club. The 21-year-old’s price tag has skyrocketed since, having scored 13 goals in 24 appearances, including 2 in the Champions League, this season and many European clubs are said to be monitoring the youngster’s progress. Report from Sport claiming Bayern Munich and AC Milan along with Sky Sports report of Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham’s interests proves that Victor Osimhen is a highly demanded striker and thus the French side want to wait until the summer to demand a higher fee. Jurgen Klopp has planned to bring the Nigerian to Anfield during the January transfer market but both Real Madrid and Barca, along with many others, have entered the race for the young prodigy. Osimhen signed a 5-year contract with the French side and although it remains to be seen if they would entertain any January deals, they will surely demand a high fee for the youngster.
