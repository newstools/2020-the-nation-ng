 THE President of Old Grammarian Society (OGS), of C.M.S Grammar School, Bariga, Lagos State, Mr. Olu Vincent has called on the government to bring together the critical stakeholders who have ideas to proffer solutions to the challenges confronting the education sector. He urged stakeholders in the sector to work harder at motivating teachers. He made the call during a presidential luncheon and thanksgiving to appreciate God for the lives of its old boys who are 70 years and above. “When you pump money and the teachers are not motivated, you cannot get the best of results, let them feel that they are part of the system and appreciate what they are doing so that they can put in their best. Their salaries might not be sufficient but let them feel important. We must also pay more attention to practical skills acquisition and vocational education in our schools so we will make the students future employers of labour rather than job seekers. Many of our graduates are jobless because they lack vocational skills. Once they can start, many people will not be running after white collar jobs again,” he said. He explained the role of the OGS in helping the government and other stakeholders to improve the sector.  “That is why the OGS is passionate about the school, government alone cannot fund education, it is a big business and the government is not putting sufficient funds into it. So what we try to do is to augment what the government is doing, build the capacity of our teachers and enhance the infrastructural development of the school. We are the oldest secondary school in Nigeria, so we want to continue to be the best in academics and infrastructure, that’s our target,” he said.
