After earning a goalless draw against FC Nouadhibou in Nouachott, Mauritania, Rangers International midfielder Chiamaka Madu  says the team’s focus is now on getting all the three points when they take on neighbours, Heartland FC in a match day 11, NPFL fixture in Okigwe. Madu made this known on Wednesday in Enugu as the seven time Nigeria league champions continue preparations for the ‘Oriental Derby’ scheduled for Sunday at Okigwe Township Stadium. “Surely, we are worried by our current position in the league and we have vowed to turn around the bad patch. It started with the result we got in Nouachott and we are taking that form to Okigwe for all three points at stake,” stated the all action midfielder. He further said, “The seriousness which we (the players) attach to this game made us to shelve all celebrations of the season and in training on a New Year day so as to propel our club to an enviable position which will make our fans, management and government happy. “I appreciate the fact that our opponent, Heartland is not too comfortable but that is for them to worry about as we have resolved to grab the maximum point at stake. By God’s grace we shall achieve our target in Okigwe.”
