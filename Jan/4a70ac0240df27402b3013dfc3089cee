Onimisi Alao, Yola  The Adamawa State Police Command has appealed for information that could lead to the arrest of the persons who assaulted a journalist, Maxwell Nashion, an assault which led to his death. The Command’s Public Relations Officer, DSP Suleman Nguroje, said Thursday that the Commissioner of Police, Audu Madaki, had directed the homicide unit of the command to swing into action to find the killers. Nguroje said a 24-hour surveillance had been directed around the area of the crime by the Command with a view to finding the assailants. Maxwell Nashion, a staff of Radio Nigeria’s Fombina FM in Yola, was found half-dead on Wednesday morning after he had been beaten up and inflicted with machete cuts by persons that are yet to be unearthed. Women going to farm had found him tied up in an isolated place close to the Fomhina FM complex after he had reportedly been dragged from his house about 2 am Wednesday. He had been rushed to the hospital in nearby Jimeta, Yola, where he died shortly afterwards. Although the Police Command is yet to speak on the motive for the attack on the late broadcaster, sources close to him have suggested it might have to do with a stolen phone which he was said to have been striving to track. A source said he hurriedly wrote a text to a friend, giving him instruction on how to retrieve the pack of the said phone from around his house, even as his assailants stood outside his house threatening him to come out. Aged 32, the late Maxwell was a staff of News and Current Affairs Department of the Fombina FM, Yola. He was reporting for the FM station from the State House of Assembly. Late Maxwell who is said to have been earnestly considering taking a wife, is survived by his father, mother and other relations.
