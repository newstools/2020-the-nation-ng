By Robert Egbe  The National Industrial Court of Nigeria has ordered Notore Chemicals Industries Plc to pay its former Group Chief Operating Officer Mr Ayodele Balogun N20,525,999.60 owed him as  balance of his gratuity since 2013. Justice Nelson Ogbuanya made the order on December 2, 2019 while delivering judgment in a suit marked NICN/LA/192/2015a between Balogun and Notore as sole claimant and defendant respectively. Balogun filed his suit through his counsel, U. U Njoku. He testified before the judge that he was employed by Notore, a fertilizer production and other agro-allied services firm, on October 1, 2008, as Chief Marketing Officer. At his resignation on October 1, 2013, he was its Group Chief Operating Officer. He said when he planned to resign to focus on personal business, sometime in June 2013, he informed one Mr. Jite Okoloko, the Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, who told him that his effective date for resignation should be October 1, 2013. This would entitle him to certain terminal benefit as gratuity in line with the gratuity policy of the defendant company. Furthermore, he said the Group HR Manager, Onome Agomate, also informed him that once he tendered his resignation, he would be advised on his terminal benefits which would be computed and paid to him. Based on the said information, by a letter dated June 14, 2013, sent via e-mail of Wednesday June 19, 2013 to Agomate, he tendered his resignation, indicating that it would take effect on 1st October 2013. That the e-mail was received and immediately accepted via the Reply e-mail by Onome Agomate. He said he thus became entitled to payment of gratuity and N41, 049,999.20 was communicated to him via e-mail of 4th September 2013, out of which only 50 per cent, which is N20, 525,999.60 was paid on June 15, 2014. But the defendant, through his counsel I.O Uwaifo sought a refund of the 50 per cent gratuity already paid. Its main contention was that the claimant did not attain the threshold of ‘continuous service greater than 5 years and up to 10 years’ to be qualified for monetary payment in addition to ‘Testimonial of Service’, which is the only package available for those who were in ‘continuous service up to 5 years’, under the Defendant’s gratuity policy. In upholding part of the claimant’s reliefs, Justice Ogbuanya held: “The Defendant is hereby ordered to pay the Claimant the outstanding balance of the sum of N20,525,999.60k owed to the Claimant as  balance of his gratuity payment due to him since 2013. “Reliefs (2) and (3) are not successful, same fail and are hereby discountenanced and dismissed.  “Cost of N1, 000,000.00 is hereby awarded in favour of the Claimant payable by the Defendant, pursuant to Or. 55 Rules 1& 4 of the NICN (Civil Procedure) Rules 2017. “The Counter-Claim fails as lacking in merit. Same is hereby dismissed. “The above sums shall be payable to the Claimant by the Defendant within 1 (one) month of this Judgment, failing which it attracts 10 per cent interest rate per annum until fully liquidated.” The judge also noted that there was a discrepancy surrounding the threshold of ‘continuous service. He held: “I find also an apparent conflict between the prescription of the table in page 4 and that of the policy prescription in page 3 of the exh.CB8. While the policy statement in page 3 has only threshold of 5 years of continuous service, the table not only has a threshold of 5 years continuous service, but divided the 5 years threshold into two folds; one is without cash payment if it is only attaining 5 years, and the second is 5 years plus up to 10 years i.e continuous service period of above 5 years up to 10 years, and that is the one attached with monetary payment. “In resolving this issue, I have formed the view that although a court of law does not form the habit of making agreement for the parties while embarking on interpretative duty in construing an agreement, yet, where parties in their own agreement are not in tandem as to the exact intention of the parties therein, the court in invoking its interpretative jurisdiction, is empowered and is at liberty to distil the contract with aim of finding out and bringing to the fore the true intention of the parties.”
