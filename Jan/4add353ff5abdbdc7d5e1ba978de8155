The General Overseer of Gospel Power Ministry, Rev Friday Bekee has said that 2020 will be a better and fruitful year for Nigerians if only they can embrace Jesus and show selfless love that is expressed in His birth and death on the cross for the redemption of mankind. He said this at the 2019 Chronicles of Nativity, an Extra Ordinary Christmas Concert organised by the church at Dansol High School, Ikeja. He said that Jesus Christ remains the greatest gift from God to man as his birth opens up a new chapter of hope of making heaven after life. He asserted that God will change the fortunes of Nigeria and the country will be a better place to live if we can appropriate the nature of God which is evidence in Christ. He challenged the leadership in the country to embrace the grace of God into their lives and allow the word of God to guide them as they paddle the canoe of the country. In her words, the Team Lead, 2019 Christmas Carol Concert, Njoku Patricia said that this year event focuses on Righteous people that lived in the land of Nazareth, with special emphasis on Joseph, the carpenter.
