 A 61-YEAR-OLD businessman, Steve Ayedun, was on Monday arraigned at an Ogudu Magistrates’ Court in Lagos for alleged perversion of justice. He was arraigned following his failure to produce his wife, a suspect, in a case of ‘obtaining under false pretence and stealing’, for whom he stood surety. The businessman, of no fixed address, is facing a two-count charge bordering on alleged conspiracy and perversion of justice before Magistrate Mrs. Bukola Mogaji. He pleaded not guilty. Prosecuting Inspector Donjour Perezi told the court that the defendant allegedly committed the offence last September 4 at Ifako Police Station, Gbagada. He alleged that the defendant conspired with another person at large to obstruct and pervert the course of justice. Perezi alleged that the defendant stood as a surety for his wife, Rachel Ayedun, who was arrested for obtaining under false pretence and stealing. The prosecutor said following his assurances, Ayedun was granted bail in the sum of N500, 000 and released to the defendant who promised to always produce her whenever she was needed and until the case was finally disposed of. He said the defendant got his wife out of custody only to enable her abscond and escape prosecution. Perezi said:” The defendant is hereby called upon to show cause why the N500, 000 bond executed by him should not be forfeited.” Magistrate Mogaji granted the defendant bail in the sum of N100, 000 with one surety in the like sum. She adjourned the case till February 21.
