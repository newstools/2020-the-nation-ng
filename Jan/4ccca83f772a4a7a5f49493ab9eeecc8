The Lagos State Fire Service on Tuesday cautioned Lagosians to be careful in handling things that could ignite fire. Acting Head of Lagos State Fire Service Mrs. Margaret Adeseye said 70 per cent of fire outbreaks were caused by carelessness. She spoke at the Deputy Governor’s Office in Alausa, Ikeja at the launch of this year’s Evacuation Drill Exercise for public servants. The theme of the exercise is: “Zero tolerance for an uncontrollable fire outbreak.” The fire service team was received by the permanent secretary in the Deputy Governor’s office. Mrs. Adeseye said the annual exercise is geared towards acquainting civil servants with the ‘dos’ and ‘don’ts’ of fire safety, what to do in case of any such eventuality as well as a safe escape from hazardous environment, among others. “The exercise will also be taken to all ministries, departments and agencies at different dates at the main and old secretariat, including the House of Assembly and other agencies of the government outside the secretariat,” she added.
