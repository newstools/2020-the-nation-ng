 Youths suspected to be sea pirates in Gbagira, Ilaje Local Government Area of Ondo State, have reportedly killed four naval ratings. The naval men were killed while trying to rescue three foreigners from being abducted. It was learnt that the suspected killers also stole their victims’ rifles and seven magazines. One of the culprits was however arrested in a suburb of Awoye community in Ilaje council. A source said the suspects came from Bayelsa State. The Commanding Officer, Forward Operating Base (FoB) in Igbokoda, Navy Commodore Danjuma Ndanusa, said he has directed community leaders to produce the stolen weapons or face the wrath of law. Ndanusa said the arrested suspect confessed that the missing rifles were in the community “We intimated the community leaders on what is at stake. It is like sleeping on a time bomb,” he said.
