The Kwara State Police Command has absolved itself of complicity in the Thursday demolition of structures on parts of the Ilofa Road, GRA land of the late Dr Olusola Saraki earlier revoked by the state government. There were reports to the effect that about 50 policemen were drafted to the area to mount security and prevent the breaking down of law and order during the demolition of the structures. Eyewitnesses said that they started hearing sound of gunshots at about 3am to scare away elderly women who were keeping vigil on the property, adding that several teargas canisters were also fired to eject them from the land. But a police source said that that the state Commissioner of Police, Kayode Egbetokun, declined the deployment of policemen to the scene of the demolition. Two days before the demolition, the command deployed policemen as well as two patrol vehicles around the precincts of the disputed land. But the command’ spokesman, Ajayi Okasanmi, said then that the action of the security men in the area was meant to prevent the breakdown of law and order. He said “it is important to forestall breakdown of law and order in the state, following perceived media war trailing the issue and various reactions from politicians on the matter.” Mr. Okasanmi told our reporters on Friday that “when the command was contacted for drafting of policemen to the demolition, the command did not accede to their request. “Police are not meant for those kinds of things,” he said.
