Agency Reporter Coalition of Societies for the Rights of Older People in Nigeria (COSROPIN) has urged Kwara Government to build befitting homes for the aged before demolishing existing ones. COSROPIN President Sen. Eze Ajoku, made this call in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja on Sunday, while reacting to plans by the state government to demolish the old people’s home in Ilorin. Ajoku said old people’s homes were necessary to advance love and care for ageing citizens. “Old people’s homes are needed in all states and communities. The old people who have no one to look after them need help from government and stakeholders. “Senior citizens centres are necessary as day cares for older persons, civilised nations have Homes Care for the aged where government and families pay for old people to be looked after,” he said. Ajoku appealed to Gov. AbdulRahman AbdulRasaq to consider the old people as his parents, urging him to desist from inflicting pain on the vulnerable. He said that COSROPIN was committed to defending its members using legal means in event of violation of their rights by organisations or government. According to him, the coalition will not stop demolitions of property in the state, but it is appealing to government to provide another home for the old people before demolishing their home. Ajoku commended Lagos State Government for providing, sustaining and servicing the old people’s homes in Yaba and called on other states to do the same. “The Lagos state government is presently constructing three new day care centres for old people, why should one governor be building for older people while another is destroying,” he said.
