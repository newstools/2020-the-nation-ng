The Lagos Internal Revenue Service (LIRS) has assured taxpayers that it has implemented additional security measures designed to prevent breaches and ensure total protection of personal information of taxpayers. Executive Chairman, Lagos Internal Revenue Service (LIRS), Ayodele Subair said it had undertaken a review and subsequently strengthened its data protection system after the agency discovered an inadvertent exposure of personal information of some taxpayers. In a statement, LIRS notified all taxpayers of a data security incident that involved inadvertent exposure of personal information in our possession. According to the agency, on Friday, December 27, 2019, in the course of a review, the agency noted a data breach on one of the payment platforms on the LIRS portal that was recently upgraded to facilitate the payment of taxes by members of the public. Subair explained that it was discovered that a ‘search’ feature recently added on the application functionality on its platform, which was designed to enable customers to search their personal payer IDs inadvertently exposed personal information of some other taxpayers. He pointed out that the data exposed did not include any financial information and the portal was disabled immediately the error was noted. “Investigations are ongoing, and taxpayers will be duly informed of all developments. The Agency is conducting a review of affected records in consultation with the Data Protection Regulator, National Information Development Agency (NITDA). The outcome of the investigation will be shared,” Subair said. He reiterated the commitment of LIRS to safety of records and confidentiality of information in its custody. “At LIRS, we respect the privacy of all taxpayers’ personal data. Our esteemed taxpayers are hereby assured of our unwavering commitment to data security and protection,” Subair said.
