Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq of Kwara has said that the re-introduction of the state sports festival is a demonstration of his administration’s determination to bring youth to limelight and ensure their talents are identified and nurtured. The governor, who was represented by his Deputy, Kayode Alabi, stated this at the flag off ceremony of the Torch-of-Unity for the 7th Kwara State Sports Festival tagged: “KWASFEST 2020” in Ilorin yesterday. He explained that the re-introduction of KWASFEST which has been moribund for almost two decades represented a progressive transition from decadence to reasonable, responsive and responsible governance that would offer entire citizens ample opportunities to be engaged meaningfully. The governor added that apart from the festival, the State Government was taking various steps and initiating numerous schemes to mould youths in the right way. This, he said, would be achieved through the Ministry of Sports and Youth Development to ensure that the instrumentality of sports was deployed to better the lives of the people.
