 Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun will tomorrow inaugurate Governor’s Elders Advisory Council (GEAC). The ceremony will hold at the Obas Complex inside the State Secretariat in Abeokuta. The governor said the composition of the 48-member Council was part of the government’s desire to tap from the fountain of wisdom of the elderly in our society and to give the state the benefit of the knowledge garnered over the years by these statesmen and women. “It is in order to walk the talk about our commitment to inclusive and participatory governance that we are doing this. We stand to benefit from these elders in our midst,” a statement by Abiodun’s spokesman, Kunle Somorin said. The newly constituted GEAC comprises critical stakeholders in the All Progressives Congress (APC) and outside the main political parties in the state. Members of the Council include statesmen and women who have the requisite governance, business and political experience necessary to deliver the dividends of democracy to the people, the statement added.
