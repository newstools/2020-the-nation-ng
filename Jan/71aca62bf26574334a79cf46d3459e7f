A middle-aged man was yesterday crushed by a mini bus, fondly called Akoto on the Ado-Iworoko road. It was gathered that the deceased, said to be supervising a renovation project around the area, stepped out to eat when the mini bus hit him. Sources, who pleaded for anonymity, said the driver was reckless. A source said: “The Akoto driver, coming from the Ado-Ekiti and headed for Iworoko was speeding when he hit the man. “The driver, seeing he had killed the man, ran into the bush. An irate mob, however, burnt the bus.” Police spokesman Sunday Abutu said: “I can confirm that a mini bus crushed a pedestrian. The man was confirmed dead and his remains had been taken to the morgue. The driver of the bus is still at large” Abutu, however, said investigation has begun to unravel the cause of the accident.
