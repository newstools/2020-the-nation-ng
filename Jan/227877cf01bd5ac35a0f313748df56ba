 Cross-over actress Toyin Abraham has come out to clear air on her health products that have stopped sales at the moment. According to the mother of one, her slim tea is still up for sales. “For the purpose of clarity, @curveslimmingteabytoyin is not the same as Toyin herbal,” she posted. “It is Toyin Herbal that was stopped not the @Curveslimmingteabytoyin. Please continue to patronize the slimming tea, it is my product. This is January, you people need to buy the tea to wash wash off the detty December fat.” This is coming up few days after the actress/producer posted on her Instagram handle that the Toyin Herbal products will be stopped due to some structural disagreement with her partners. She however, assured her clients that all pending orders will be attended to and necessary refunds made. But she did not disclose when the herbal products will resume sales. In October 2019, after Toyin delivered of her son, she diversified into the herbal medicine business by launching Toyin’s Herbal. Revealing that her journey to motherhood was challenging, Toyin said that she started the business to empower women suffering from the anxiety that comes with wanting their own children and other diseases.
