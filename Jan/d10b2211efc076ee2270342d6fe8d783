The management of Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) said it has energised a new 100MVA 132/33kV power transformer installed in Ogba transmission substation, Lagos State. The energised transformer, which was installed under the supervision of TCN’s engineers, has increased the capacity of the substation from 165MVA to 265MVA. TCN General Manager, Public Affairs, Mrs. Ndidi Mbah, disclosed this on Thursday. She said prior to the installation of the 100MVA power transformer, Ogba substation had a total of two units of 60MVA 132/33kV power transformers and one unit of 45MVA 132/33kV mobile power transformer. To ensure optimal utilisation of the newly installed power transformer, new switchyard made up of 132kV, 33kV  three  33kV feeders were equally installed and commissioned. She said the increase in the substation’s capacity from 165MVA to 265MVA means that the substation has more bulk electricity available for Ikeja Electricity Distribution Company (DisCo) to take to its customers within Ikeja industrial area including Ogba – Ijaiye, Agege Pen Cinema, Magoro Cement, Ojodu and Ifako-Ijaiye areas of Lagos State. She added that to optimise the capacity of the newly commissioned 100MVA at Ogba and other substations feeding Ikeja Distribution Company, TCN has already imported high capacity conductors and would soon conclude on re-conducting contract that will expand the transmission lines under IKEDC. This will more than double the current capacity of the lines, Mbah said. Mbah said TCN is religiously implementing the Transmission, Rehabilitation and Expansion Programme (TREP) under which the capacity of the company will be expanded to 20,000 megawatts (Mw) by 2023.
