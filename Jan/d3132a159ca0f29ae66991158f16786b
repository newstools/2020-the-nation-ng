 Some subscribers to the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) on Thursdays shut down the clinic run by the scheme at the UNIMED Teaching Hospital Akure, Ondo State capital. They were prostesting poor service delivery by the management of the hospital. They paralysed activities at the clinic, as they chased out all the staff. The protesters, who were led by the Director, Federal Scholarships Board, Mr Michael Ogunwale, lamented that for almost one year the NHIS clinic at the UNIMED hospital had been “maltreating” them. According to Ogunwale, the clinic has not been providing prescribed drugs to enrollees in the past seven months and has also failed to provide doctors, a development he claimed had resulted in the death of many patients. He said they could no longer tolerate the poor service they were getting from the UNIMED teaching hospitals, hence the protest. Ogunwale called on the NHIS and the Ondo State Government to do the needful in the interest of all enrollees, who relied on the scheme to get health care services. Chairman, Medical Advisory Committee (CMAC) of UNIMED Teaching Hospital, Dr. Gbala Michael, who held a closed-door meeting with the protesting patients for almost an hour, promised to address all issues raised.
