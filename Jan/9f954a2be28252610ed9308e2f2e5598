 Ogun State Government is set to inaugurate the newly reconstructed Osi-Ota-Ikola-Navy, Ray Power roads. The roads are links that connect Lagos State and Ado/Ota Local Government area of the state. Works and Infrastructure Commissioner Ade Akinsanya, in a statement made available by the ministry’s Press Officer, Olayinka Olufemi, said that the Governor Dapo Abiodun administration prioritised the roads due to his determination to further open up the state for economic development. Akinsanya, an engineer, added that Ado -Odo/Ota would be the first council in the state to have its roads inaugurated by the present administration. He said construction of the link road had reached an advanced level and receiving finishing touches, which included street lighting, painting of kerbs, road signs and road medians, among others. He said that on completion, people’s quality of life would be improved, as travellers would have alternative routes to ply, and it would also create mutual economic benefits to both states.
