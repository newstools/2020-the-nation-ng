The Port Harcourt International Airport has been plunged into darkness, following a bush fire that engulfed part of the airport’s surrounding bushes on Tuesday, an official said. The Manager of Corporate Communications at Port Harcourt Electricity Distribution Company (PHED), Mr John Onyi, confirmed the development on Thursday to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital. NAN reports that the fire occurred in the late hours of January 28, several weeks after a similar incident at the same airport, which resulted in flights delays. But normal flight operations later resumed at the airport after three-days of closure, when the fire had been extinguished. According to Onyi, the Tuesday fire destroyed PHED facilities, resulting in power cuts at the airport. “The bush fire damaged over 14 high tension poles supplying electricity to the airport’s 33kv feeder. “However, PHED technical crew have been mobilised to the site, with a view to erecting the poles and restoring power supply to the airport,” he said. The spokesman urged airport authorities and travellers to be patience throughout the period repairs of the facilities would last.
