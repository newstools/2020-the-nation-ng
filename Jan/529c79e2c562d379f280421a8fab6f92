Oke–Irhue, an agrarian community in Uhunmwode Local Government of Edo State has been connected to the national grid. The community enjoyed electricity for the first time on Sunday.  A statement by the Benin Electricity Distribution Company (BEDC) said connecting Oke–Irhue was in furtherance of its mandate to light up communities in its franchise states. It added that connecting Oke-Irhue to the grid demonstrated BEDC’s resolve to partner these communities to address their power challenges having fulfilled necessary preconditions for energisation. President of OCGA National Assembly Douglas Agbonleni said: “The people of Oke-Irhue are happy in that 15 months after the community’s general assembly took up the challenge and struggle…God finally answered our prayers …by granting our village the opportunity to be connected to the … today, December 29, 2019, a project which has been ongoing since 2002.” Agbonleni praised the people for their patience, commitment and cooperation in ensuring that the energisation project became a reality. He urged them to guide ‘this noble project jealously against vandals’. The community leader noted that there would be re-awakened socio-economic advantage engendered by the new status. He thanked BEDC for its guide, support and understanding, and promised that the OCGA would ensure safety of the equipment and meet its financial obligations.
