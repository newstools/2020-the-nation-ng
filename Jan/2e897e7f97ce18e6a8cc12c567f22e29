Akpabio and his party, the All Progressives Congress(APC) had Friday withdrawn from the rerun citing irregularities by the Independent National Electoral Commission(INEC) led by its resident electoral commissioner in the state, Mr. Mike Igini’s. However, despite the withdrawal, there was palpable tension at Akpabio’s polling unit as heavily armed security operatives and armed thugs barred journalists and persons without permanent voters card(PVC) from passing through the gate of the school. Our correspondent observed that voting was going on in the three polling units located within the premises of the Independence High School, Ukana West. There was a general low turnout of voters for the rerun.
