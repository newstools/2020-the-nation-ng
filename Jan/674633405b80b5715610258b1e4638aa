A lone Robert Firminoâ€™s strike in the first half was enough to earn high-flying Liverpool maximum three points in a keenly-contested match with Tottenham. With the victory, Liverpool have won 20 out of the last 21 games in English Premier League. The Jose Mourinho-coached Spurs did all they could to equalise with strikers Son and Lucas Moura, losing clear chances. Substitute Le Coslo had frittered away a golden chance to equalise. At the end, the Jurgen Kloop-trained team held on to add to their winning streak, which has lasted for over a year.
