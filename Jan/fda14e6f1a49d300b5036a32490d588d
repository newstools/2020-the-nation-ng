Nigeria international Henry Onyekuru has become father of two after his wife welcome their baby girl. Onyekuru shared a post on his official Instagram status with the caption: “My princess is here.” He added: “I love you”. The 22-year-old left Everton in August 2019, two years after joining them due to his failure to secure a work permit in England. He was sent on loan to RSC Anderlecht and Galatasaray. Onyekuru won the Super Lig and the Turkish League Cup in his first stint at the club in the 2018-19 seasons. The Super Eagles winger recently re-joined Turkish League giants Galatasaray on a short term loan deal from AS Monaco after he made only four appearances for the French League side with one assist credited to him in the first half of the season.
