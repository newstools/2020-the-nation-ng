Emma Elekwa, Onitsha  Vice Chancellor, Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, Anambra state, Prof. Charles Esimone on Monday vowed to expel students of the institution with forged or mutilated certificates. He said certificate forgery and mutilation of any form remained a criminal offence in the university with its attendant penalties. Addressing fresh students during a 4-day orientation course ahead of their matriculation, the VC advised the students to ensure the genuineness of their certificates to avoid regrets. He said, “If the certificates you submitted at the Admission Office are forged, my candid advice to you is that you pack your bag and baggage and leave now. “There is a standing Senate Committee that does the verification and if your certificate is forged or mutilated even for one subject, you’ll be expelled and handed over to the police.” Esimone further announced plans by the university to install Close Circuit televisions (CCTV) in all the examination halls to assist the institution in dictating culprits for immediate sanctions. “The university does not condone examination misconduct in any form and takes strong disciplinary action as soon as it is detected. “You are not allowed to sit for any examination for anybody or ask someone to write any exam for you. You’re not allowed to talk to anybody except the invigilator. While congratulating the students for the feat of gaining admission, Esimone urged them to take advantage of the exercise for maximum productivity. The Dean, Students Affairs, Prof. Chinonso Achebe said the orientation course was to acquaint the students with the university’s vision and mission, including its ranking among the top 200 universities in the world.
