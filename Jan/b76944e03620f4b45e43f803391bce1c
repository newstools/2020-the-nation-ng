A member of the Abia State Vigilance Service aka Bakassi has been arrested for allegedly killing a boy in Aba, Abia State, over an argument. The deceased, Chinemerem Ifeanyi, 17, an indigene of Anambra State, was allegedly stabbed in several parts of his body by the suspect, Sunday Kalu, aged 37. The Nation gathered that the incident, which occurred around 8pm on Agu Road, Ndiegoro in Aba South Local Government, was prevented from degenerating into a crisis by the police from Ndiegoro Division. Residents told our reporter that Ifeanyi was returning home from work when he had a misunderstanding with Kalu. A source, who preferred anonymity, said that he overheard the late Ifeanyi and Kalu arguing over the ownership of a phone. He said: “I overheard Ifeanyi saying ‘leave my phone’, while the man he was arguing with (Kalu) was struggling to take the phone. “At that time, I never knew the man was a Bakassi member. I thought the argument was between street boys. “Later I heard a scream. Me and some people rushed to the scene and found Ifeanyi in a pool of blood, stabbed in the neck and shoulder. “The whole place was becoming dark. The man quickly abandoned the phone and tried to escape. “Some people, who recognised him, called the Cameroun Barracks Police Station and they went after him and arrested him. “The unfortunate thing was that we later found the receipt of the phone on Ifeanyi and it bore his name. This means, he bought the phone and it was still new.” Police Commissioner Ene Okon confirmed the incident. He said the case had been transferred to the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (SCIID).
