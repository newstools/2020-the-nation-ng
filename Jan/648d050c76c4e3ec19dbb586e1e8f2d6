Lagos State Government has said it has begun mass recruitment in the health sector. The government, through the Lagos Health Service Commission (LHSC), said the recruitment was meant to address deficit in manpower requirement in the public health institutions. LHSC’s Permanent Secretary Dr. Ademuyiwa Eniayewun spoke about the steps being taken by the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration to revamp the sector and improve health care services. He said this was a fulfilment of the promise made by the governor to Lagosians, “having vowed during the campaigns that he would make health care services more qualitative and accessible to all and sundry.” Eniayewun said it was in the light of the pre-election promise that Sanwo-Olu approved the recruitment of large numbers of health workers, while directing that exit replacement be ensured as at when due in order to cushion the effects of brain drain that occurred in the health sector regularly. The permanent secretary said that the recruitment would not only take immediate effect, but would also continue in phases in the next few months in order to bridge manpower gap in the system. “The quantum of workers to be recruited as we speak is phenomenal. This move is an indication of the commitment of Mr. Governor to ensure prompt and quality service delivery in hospitals at all times,” he said. Eniayewun said to apply for positions, applicants should forward their applications by printing the forms online via www.lagosstate.gov.ng
