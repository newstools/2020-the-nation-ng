 Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Minister of State, Dr. Ramatu Aliyu, has urged the United Nations (UN) to rid the world of terrorism, climate change, discrimination, food insecurity and other challenges confronting human race. Aliyu spoke on Wednesday at the opening plenary session of the fifth Abuja International Model United Nations conference as part of activities to commemorate the UN at 75. Represented by the Director of Gender at FCT Social Development secretariat, Dr. Agnes Hart, the minister noted that the UN anniversary should help to renew hope for the future. Aliyu said: “There is no better time to address these global challenges confronting the human race, especially terrorism and other vices associated to it. To most of us, there is hope that we have all learnt that we are too interconnected and interdependent today for the era of unilateralism of the past, a cause of needless conflicts and destructions, to remain attractive to anyone. “The hope that as we take steps to correct our mistakes of the past, we are laying the foundations for new beginnings, the responsibility for which we are indebted to our children and children’s children. “I say these with all sense of responsibility because the United Nations Organisation was created 75 years ago for these same reasons, in the wake of a global conflict whose scars are yet to completely heal.” A statement on Wednesday by her Special Assistant (Media), Austin Elemue, said the minister hailed the UN for bringing different nations together to voice out their concerns, grievances as well as pool their ideas and resources together to carry every nation along in the processes that lead to decision making on issues that concern their existence.
