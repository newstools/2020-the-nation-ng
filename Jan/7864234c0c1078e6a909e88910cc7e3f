James Azania, Lokoja  Pa Adamu Aduku, presumably Nigeria’s oldest war veteran, has passed on, at the age of 101. He died at his country home Abejukolo-Ife in Omala Local Government Area of Kogi State, on Tuesday. Aduku, a World War II (WWII) veteran, hailed from Abejukolo-Ife in Omala LGA of Kogi State, died on Tuesday at the age of 101. The Kogi State Governor, Alhaji Yahaya Bello extolled the virtues of the late Payment Aduku, Nigeria’s oldest military survivor of the Second World War, which was fought between 1939 and 1945. Governor Bello, in his condolence message which was made available to meet, yesterday, in Lokoja, described the late Aduku as a true patriot who gave his service to the fatherland and was blessed by God to witness its blossoming. He added that the late war veteran died a fulfilled man and remained a worthy ambassador of Kogi State. He said that such was the spirit, passion and zest of the people of the state, in their endeavours, as they often seek to stand out. He commended the Federal Government and the Nigeria military for recently honouring the late Pa Aduku, while he was still alive and not posthumously. The governor condoled with the family and the loved ones of the late soldier, noting that his passing was not one for mourning, but rather a celebration of a life of sacrifice well lived. He condoled with the people of the state, particularly the people of Omala LG, in Kogi East, over the “glorious exit of their worthy son of the land who brought his people and locality to limelight.” While praying for the repose of the deceased’s soul, Governor Bello noted that the late Aduku, alongside those who had rendered service to the fatherland be forever remembered in the history of our dear country.
