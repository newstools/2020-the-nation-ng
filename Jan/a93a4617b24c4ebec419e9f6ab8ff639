By Julius Okorie  Super Eagles striker Kelechi Iheanacho produced a master class goal to hand Leicester City FA cup victory over Brentford on Saturday. The Nigerian international, who some say is returning to his early Manchester City days, shot Leicester City into the lead as early as the 4th minute before even Brentford knew what hit them. The goal turned out to be the only goal of the match as the Foxes advanced in the FA cup. Some analysts said they were not surprised that Iheanacho got the goal describing the FA cup as one of his hunting ground. Although Championship side Brentford put up spirited efforts, it failed to stop the Foxes from running away with a lone goal victory thanks to Iheanacho who was in action for 68 minutes before being substituted by K. Dewsbury-Hall. Only few days back Iheanacho saved Leicester from defeat the league cup clash against Aston Villa that ended 1-1 with Iheanacho getting a 74th minute goal after the visitors had shot into the lead in the 28th minute. With Saturdayâ€™s goal Iheanacho has extended his goals in the FA Cup to nine. The foxes will again be banking on Iheanacho to finish what he has started when they face file out on Tuesday against Aston Villa in the League cup replay.
