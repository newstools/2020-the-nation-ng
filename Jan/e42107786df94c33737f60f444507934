 Nigeria women team has been handed a tough task on their quest to berth at Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games as the West African side will slug it out against Poland in the first round of the competition holding in Portugal. The women’s team led by Edem Offiong and Olufunke Oshonaike will face a star-studded Polish side which has Paralympic gold medalist, Natalia Partyka. Oshonaike is optimistic saying they would surely give their best against the Polish team. “It is not going to be a walk-over for us against the Polish team because we know the players and we are not going to respect them too much. As long as they are eager to make it to Tokyo 2020, we are also willing to be part of the party in Japan,” Oshonaike told NationSport. Being the first international tournament of the year and the most important; the 2020 ITTF World Team Qualification tournament, serves off in Gondomar as it provides a passport to the most celebrated sporting event of all, the Tokyo Olympic Games. Elsewhere in the men’s event there are 34 teams registered; thus an opening round comprising four outfits is required. Italy, the no.26 seeds, meet Malaysia, the no.34 seeds, the winners confronting Belgium, the no.12 seeds; Poland, the no.23 seeds, face Lithuania, the no.33 seeds, the successful team meeting Nigeria, the no.14 seeds. Notably for the winners of the latter exchanges, Chinese Taipei, the no.2 seeds, could await; in the opening round they meet Thailand, the no.28 seeds. For Nigeria’s Segun Toriola, seeking an eighth Olympic Games appearance, a tough task awaits.
