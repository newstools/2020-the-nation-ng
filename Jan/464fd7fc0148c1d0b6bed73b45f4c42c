After an eventful five years, EduTech has recorded its first batch of graduates in its degree programme. The 37 graduating students took part in the recent 44th Convocation Ceremony of Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) and bagged B.Sc degrees in Accounting. Expressing delight at the successful completion of the degree programmes, General Manger, EduTech, Femi Shonubi said the graduation ceremony was a validation of the firm’s e-learning platform and its ability to provide students with a robust system leading to the award of a degree. “We are grateful to our partners -the OAU Management -as well as the students for trusting our solution,” Shonubi said. Introduced in 2014 to deepen the experience of the university’s part-time learning programme, the EduTech platform replaced the erstwhile weekend learning mode with an online blended mode that is accessible to students remotely through an internet connection. Through this epoch-making partnership with OAU, EduTech successfully launched B.sc degree programmes in Accounting, Economics and Nursing; with other courses of study in the pipeline. “EduTech is pleased to contribute its quota to nation building by providing seamless platforms for students to conveniently take part in course work from their homes or offices and earn a full degree. We are happy to work with a progressive-minded institution like the OAU Center of Distance Learning to facilitate their Accounting, Economics and Nursing degree programmes. We are also very excited on our soon-to-be launched partnership with the Babcock University Centre for Open Distance and e-Learning where prospective students will be able to leverage our platforms to study for degree awarding courses from the university,” Shonubi said.
