 Renowned banker and founder of the First City Monument Bank (FCMB) and also head of Funsengbuwa Ruling House, Otunba Olasubomi Balogun has distanced himself from the rumours being peddled by some people that he is interested in being the king of Ijebuland. Subomi, who is also the head of princes in Ijebuland (the Olori Omoba of Ijebuland), and also the Asiwaju of Ijebu, said this  during the Arojojoye ruling house of Ijebuland annual general meeting at Fusengbuwa Family Museum, Ijebu-Ode, Ogun State. He said “I have no interest in Ijebuland kingship or the throne of Awujale of Ijebuland. Oba Sikiru Kayode Adetona is still alive and we must fear God. “I am content with what I have and none of my children is eyeing any kingship even though they are boys, but we are okay with what we have. It is a taboo in Yorubaland to be scheming for Oba’s successor when a reigning monarch is still alive. “Awujale happens to be my friend and he’s the one that named me as Olori Omo-Oba in 1985 and I will never arm my fellow human being,” he said.
