Fundamentals are not strong enough to drive a natural correction in the equities market, however, recent policy directives from the CBN might offer some respite to the domestic bourse in the absence of much needed market friendly reforms,” Cordros Securities stated. Analysts at Afrinvest Securities stated that recent price appreciation might trigger profit-taking, which expectedly will moderate price rally. “In the coming week, we expect mixed performance in the equities market due to profit-taking activities and investors’ positioning in undervalued stocks,” Afrinvest Securities stated.
