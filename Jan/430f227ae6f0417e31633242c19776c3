The leadership of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has pleaded with both Adamawa and the Federal government to further intensify efforts to secure the release of Chairman of Adamawa State CAN, Rev Lawan Andimi. The CAN chairman was abducted by Boko Haram terrorists few weeks ago when the predominantly Christian community in the state was invaded. The cleric, in a video footage released by his captors days after he was kidnaped, appealed to the Federal Government, the Adamawa State Governor and the leadership of CAN to come to his aid. But, up till now the cleric is still in captivity. Pastor Adebayo Oladeji, Special Assistant on Media and Communications, to the CAN President, Rev. Samson Ayokunle who spoke with The Nation on the development said: “no information on him yet. But it is our hope that he will be released. We are still praying and trusting God that the government of the day will help us to rescue him and other people in the terrorist camp”. A source close to the Adamawa State government told our correspondent that the Adamawa State governor and the CAN leadership currently met in the state to fine tune measures to ensure that the man regains his freedom. The source said: “what I can tell you is that the state governor and top leaders of CAN met in the state recently and discussed how to rescue him. But, I will not tell you what they discussed and the next move of the state government to rescue the man of God from captivity. I know that government is not resting on its oars in ensuring that the CAN chairman regains freedom. ” I can assure you that soon, he will be rescued”.
