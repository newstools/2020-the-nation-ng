Blessing pour even more for nine-time African champions, Blessing Oborududu, after she bagged a degree in Business Administration (BADM) from Niger Delta University (NDU) Wilberforce Island, Bayelsa State. The Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games gold medalist was among the 15,811 graduates at the combined 5TH  convocation ceremony comprising  students from the 2014 through 2019 academic sessions of the University , The ceremony and awards of degree was conducted held at the Amassoma campus of the institution last weekend much to the delight of the multiple national champions. She said it was not easy to have been able to combine wrestling with her education even as she advised other wrestlers to adopt her style. “Combining wrestling and going to school was not easy at all,” an overwhelmed Oborududu said in an interview with NationSport. “But as time goes on, it becomes part of things that my body system got used to. So after training, rest for some time then go to school. That has been my programme. “I always want to go to school. My late elder brother wanted me to go to school and not be a wrestler. So I promised him I will go to school no matter what. After wrestling for some time, I decided to go to school in 2012. “I really wanted to have different knowledge outside wrestling. I also receive motivation from the President of the Nigeria Wrestling Federation, Daniel Igali who emphasised the importance of education to us. “I thank God for giving me the grace to complete my degree. My gratitude also goes to the wrestling federation president, my supervisor, Dr. Chris and my classmates for their support all these years,” she told NationSport.
