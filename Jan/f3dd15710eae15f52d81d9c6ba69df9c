 Kano State Public Complaints and Anti-Corruption Commission says it recovered over N256, 014,170.00 in 2019. Executive Chairman of the Commission, Muhuyi Magaji Rimin Gado, who briefed reporters yesterday, explained that the anti-graft agency received a total of 3, 192 complaints. He added that while 608 of the complaints were resolved, 72 were withdrawn and 220 were declined within the year under review. He also said 196 plots of land, 14 houses and 15 farmlands of different sizes and status were also recovered across the state. Muhuyi, who is on the verge of completing his five-year tenure as the Executive Chairman of the Kano anti-graft agency, noted that the Commission witnessed a sharp decline in recoveries due to the level of awareness and campaign against corruption launched by the agency. According to him, the agency has been able to establish branches across the 44 local government areas of the state in its bid to rid Kano of corruption and corrupt practices. Muhuyi, who emphasized that the Commission exhibited both civil and criminal powers in its investigations, insisted that Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje did not at any time interfered in its activities. He also recalled how he was able to sanitise the Commission, which according to him, was comatose when he assumed office in 2015, adding that the Kano anti-graft Commission had remained a referrence point in the fight against corruption in the country and beyond. He also dedicated his achievements to the staff and officers of the Commission, who he said were subjected to frequent training and re-training to boost their manpower resources. He commended Kano residents for their cooperation and advised government agencies, citizens, corporate bodies and the general public to shun corruption and make the state a corrupt-free society. Muhuyi thanked Governor Ganduje for giving him free-hand to serve the state and humanity.
