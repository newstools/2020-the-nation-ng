An angry husband has reportedly butchered his mother-in-law, to death in Arubayi Street of Warri, Delta state ( both yet-to-be identified). The incident was said to have occurred few hours after the shout of the New Year. It was gathered that the assailant later drank poison after committing the act and died as a result. A witness who spoke with The Nation said the suspect had gone to the victim’s house, cutlass in hand, with the intention to harm her daughter, his estranged wife. However, the daughter whose identity could not be ascertained, was said to have taken to her heels on seeing the husband. According to reports, the couple whose marriage was not supported by the deceased mother-in-law, had been separated, but the man not wanting to let the woman go, decided to attack her. They have two children together. A Keke Napep rider who witnessed part of the incident narrated thus: “she ran away. But her mother could not run because she had pains on one of her legs. This man faced the poor woman and cut her severally until she died. “The neighbours all ran away. They said they were afraid. But the man later took poison and died this morning near Island Clinic. He wore a green native and canvass. But the body has been removed.” Sources at the ‘B’ Division of the Warri Area Command, confirmed the incident, disclosing that both corpses have been deposited at the Central Hospital, Warri, morgue. The Delta State Police Command confirmed the development. The Commissioner of Police, Mr. Adeyinka Adeleke, said “yes, it is true. The Man has also killed himself.”
