Former Oyo State governor Senator Abiola Ajimobi has condoled with the All Progressives Congress (APC) members in the state over the brutal murder of a chieftain of the party, Alhaji Babatunde Oreitan. Oreitan, 74, was murdered in his house at Oremeji Agugu in Ona Ara Local Government on Wednesday. His killers were said to have strangled him before cutting off the veins in his right hand and leg leading to exsanguination. A statement from the former governor’s media office signed by Bolaji Tunji said Ajimobi, who visited the family of the slain APC chieftain, was accompanied by the state Chairman of the party, Chief Akin Oke, party EXCO members and former commissioners in the last administration. Ajimobi, who said he received the death with disbelief and shock, described the killing of Oreitan as a dastardly act and urged the police to work assiduously to unravel the motive behind the killing, with a view to arresting the perpetrators. “It is unfortunate that some people will take the law into their hands to kill a man as old as this. What could have been his offence?” The ex-governor prayed for the repose of the soul of Oreitan and urged his family to take consolation in the fact that he lived a good life. “He lived a life of service to the people. He served his community and the party well. He was a progressive politician to the core and held onto the ideals of progressive politics until his death,” he said. Ajimobi described the late politician as humane, kind hearted, humble and pleasant, stressing that his approach to issues had proved him to be a patriotic citizen, who used his potential to promote the cause of APC in his local government and the state. While praying for the repose of the soul of the deceased, the governor beseeched God to grant his family the fortitude to bear the irreplaceable loss.
