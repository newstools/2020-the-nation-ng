The Civil Liberties Organisation (CLO) in Anambra State has urged Nigerians to be patriotic by supporting the Federal Government in nation- building. Chairman Vincent Ezekwueme, in his New Year message, said: “Nigerians who have God’s love and grace to celebrate New Year should embrace positive change for the betterment of the country. For us to get it right, we must love one another and the country. “Let us use the New Year to foster love, peace, unity and empathy. We must make necessary sacrifices for the much anticipated peace; while common interest and social well-being of the people should supersede personal or selfish interest.”
