  THE Apapa-Iganmu Local Council Development Area in Lagos has presented three vehicles to the police. This, the council said, was to enhance the police security of lives and property. The council Chairman, Dr Funmilayo Akande-Mohammed, praised the security agencies for curbing violence in the council. She said the presentation of official cars to the Divisional Police Officers in the council was to aid their duties and boost their job performance. The three Divisional Police Officers – CSP Olufemi Akinola -Ijora Badia, CSP Folashade Daniel – Orile and Kadiri Saheed received the vehicle keys. Dr Akande-Mohammed advised them not to relent in putting in their best and put the vehicle into good use. She said: “I want to thank our Police officers for doing their best to ensure that Apapa Iganmu LCDA is properly policed. We will want you to continue to do more; this is why we are presenting you these mini-buses to help you discharge your duties effectively.” Earlier before the presentation, Dr Akande-Mohammed during a Budget Retreat, expressed his satisfaction towards the residents and stakeholders in the council for their continuous belief in her administration. She promised to deliver more infrastructures and implement developmental programmes this year. The council boss warned the residents against indiscriminate dumping of refuse as relevant Bye-laws are on ground to punish offenders.
