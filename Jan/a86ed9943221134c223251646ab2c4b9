The Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare on Thursday inspected the Sunday Dankaro House in Abuja, which is the new home of the Nigerian Football Federation (NFF). The minister, however, expressed satisfaction with the level of work while saying that he had to visit to ascertain the state of the building. “It is a working visit for me, my first time of inspecting Sunday Dankaro building and I feel it is important to see what is going on with the building. This is a befitting building. I am impressed with what I have seen so far, this building should be functional in two weeks and it is a befitting structure for Nigeria’s football,” Dare said. “The building is long overdue and that is why the Sunday Dankaro House must be put in place so that the Moshood Abiola Stadium will be busy once again”, the Minister added. It would be recalled that the building was named after the late Sunday Dankaro who until his demise was an industrialist, businessman and former NFF boss cum sports administrator.
