The Turkish Football Federation have issued a license to Nigeria international Henry Onyekuru to enable him play in the country. The license is a seal of approval from the football regulator that he is now a bona fide player of Galatasaray and eligible to represent the Turkish champions in their upcoming matches, allnigeriasoccer.com reports. The player’s license number 16956 issued yesterday showed that he joined Galatasaray on January 5 and the agreement between the parties will end on May 31, 2020. Onyekuru has been ruled out of Galatasaray’s first league game of 2020 against Eddy Onazi’s Denizlispor as he is recovering from malaria he contacted while holidaying in Nigeria. The former Everton winger is expected to resume training with his teammates next week, assuming he does not suffer a relapse, which means the earliest date he can make his second debut for the Lions is January 23 when they face Rizespor in the Turkish Cup. Meanwhile, a license has not yet been issued to another Nigerian winger Jesse Sekidika amid speculation linking him with a loan move before the close of the transfer window. The 23-year-old terminated his contract with second-tier Eskisehirspor on January 8 before sealing a transfer to Galatasaray the following day.
