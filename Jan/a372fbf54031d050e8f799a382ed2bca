The Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) has called for a law that would protect health workers against assault while on duty. The association made the call in a statement jointly signed by its President, Aliyu Sokomba; the Secretary General, Bilkis Muhammed and Publicity and Social Secretary, Egbogu Stanley. In the statement made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Kaduna on Sunday, the association decried the rising incidences of assault of health workers while carrying out their legitimate duties. The doctors suggested that governments should pass the law to make any attack on doctors a non-bailable offence with a minimum of one-year jail term. They lamented that the health professionals were being threatened and attacked, even while providing life-saving emergencies. According to them, there was a dire need for legal protection that would ensure a secure working environment for doctors and other healthcare providers in the country. “We condemn in very clear terms the recent assault of a female doctor at Maitama District Hospital, Abuja, who was violently attacked and stripped naked by relatives of patients she was treating. “It is disheartening that a female doctor will be physically abused in such a dishonorable manner. “In another incident on Jan. 14, at Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital Nnewi, two male doctors on a call at the Special Care Unit were beaten mercilessly by patient relatives. “The assailants attacked the doctors after losing a newborn baby to neonatal asphyxia after several efforts to resuscitate the baby failed.
