 TRAFFIC controllers under the aegis of the Nigerian Traffic Wardens Service have decried poor conditions of service and dearth of personnel. The service also rued over accumulated arrears of promotions and retirements, calling on President Muhammadu Buhari to bail them out of the stranglehold of the Nigeria Police Force. In a letter to President Buhari entitled: Traffic Wardens Service Appeal to Mr. President to come to their rescue, the traffic wardens bemoaned their subjugation to the NPF. The letter signed by its national president, Ojalatan Ireti Raphael, also enjoined the president to assent to the Traffic Wardens Bill 2019 (HB 596) passed by the 8th Senate on May 22nd, 2019. The letter reads: “The entire traffic wardens service acknowledges your love for Nigerian youths and strongly believes that you are a man of your words. Establishing traffic warden service will have a great positive impact in the lives of thousands of unemployed youth as current personnel are very few in numbers. Decree 21 of 1975 that establishes the Traffic Warden Service has subjected us to untold hardship and total lack of recruitment, promotion, accoutrements, discrimination, oppression, unnecessary detention, training and retraining and other welfare packages under the police force. “Since 200 till date no recruitment has been done and thousands of our senior officers had retired. Those that are recruited in 2007 and 2008 are still stagnated with corporal ranks while the conventional police who are recruited at the same 2007/2008 are now hanging their inspector rank. Even those that were enlisted into the job in 1989 are still inspectors, they only enjoy three time promotions over 28 years in service, while conventional police counterparts have hanged assistant superintendent rank over six years now. It is pathetic to be in our fatherland serving our nation and be oppressed and denied our right and joy of being Nigerians.”
