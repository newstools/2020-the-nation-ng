An Iwo Road Magistratesâ€™ Court sitting in Ibadan, Oyo State, on Tuesday sentenced a 45-year-old scavenger, Kamorudeen Salau, to a 30-working day jail term for stealing Christmas decorations worth N25,000, property of Oyo State Government. Chief Magistrate Mr. Taiwo Oladiran, in his judgment, said that the defendant was found guilty as charged. Oladiran, who said the convict must spend the jail term at Agodi Correctional Centre, however, gave him an option of N20,000 fine. Prosecuting Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Sunday Ogunremi said that the convict, on December 26, at about 11:30am, allegedly stole some iron rods, valued at N20,000 and some Christmas decorations valued at N5,000. He said the total value of stolen items, being the property of Oyo State Government, was N25,000.
