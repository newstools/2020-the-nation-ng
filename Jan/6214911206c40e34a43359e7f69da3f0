Daniel Ogechi Akujobi Memorial (DOAM) Foundation’s annual Charity Golf Tournament enters its 10th year and preparations are in top gear to make the 2020 event a milestone edition. According to DOAMF, this year’s edition would showcase in retrospect, all the projects (in health and education) that the Foundation has executed with proceeds of its charity golf tournaments in the last nine years. Pat Bassey, who has been the Coordinator of the organising committee of the event since inception, said over 80,000 lives have been touched, adding that a significant part of the funding for the various life-changing projects have come from the annual charity golf tournament. He further explained that the achievements would not have been possible, if not for the magnanimity and support shown to the Foundation by corporate organisations and kind-hearted individuals during the yearly Charity Golf Tournaments. Hence, as a mark of gratitude, this year’s 10th edition would be devoted to showcasing the various intervention projects that have been made possible with the support received from donors. He also, confirmed that the Golf Section of Ikoyi Club 1938, and the Ikoyi Golf Community, in Lagos, have been very supportive, having adopted the Foundation as a key ally in deploying Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities. Ebi Pinnick, a member of the Organizing Committee also commented: “The 2020 DOAMF Charity Golf Tournament is a way of consolidating the trust patrons have in the Foundation” reiterating that “the organizing team remains optimistic that this year, there would be more interventions that will build on and surpass our previous efforts in the last nine years.” The qualifier for this year’s edition has been fixed for February 1, 2020, at the Golf Section of Ikoyi Club 1938 in Lagos.
