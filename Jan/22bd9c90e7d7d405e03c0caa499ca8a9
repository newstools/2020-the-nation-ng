With Victor Akande  NIGERIAN director and cinematographer, Ibikunle ‘Tsaint’ Ibitayo, through his video production company, SketchedByTsaint, will be holding a 3-Day practical and hands-on training for budding filmmakers. The training which runs from January 16 to 18, 2020, and is tagged #Shootyourshortbytsaint, is coming at no cost for interested participants. According to Tsaint, the training is his own way of giving back to the film community by providing opportunities for entry and mid-level filmmakers to gain the desired knowledge. The training which will hold at the American Corner of CCHub, Yaba Lagos, will take the participants through the rudiments of Directing, cinematography and lighting. “This is the first edition of this training and the idea is to get more young people interested in filmmaking. We also hope that, through the training, we will be raising the standards of filmmaking in Nigeria,” he said.  Tsaint further revealed that participants do not need to have formal film training, however, the selection process will be rigorous and competitive. Tsaint, who has worked with high-level brands/organisations nationally and internationally in the past five years has also announced that at the end of the training, participants will work on an actual film set, shooting their own short films to kickstart their career in film. This training is proudly supported by the American corner at Cchub and Document Women, owned by Investigative Journalist & Filmmaker Kiki Mordi who is sponsoring a training slot for five Women to partake in this film course.
