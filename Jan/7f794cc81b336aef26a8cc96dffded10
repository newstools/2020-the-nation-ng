An auto mechanic, Jonathan Odia, 28, at the weekend appeared at an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court, Lagos for allegedly converting a customer’s N130,000 meant for the repair of her faulty car to personal use. Odia, whose house address was not provided, was arraigned on a three-count charge of conspiracy, stealing and obtaining money under false pretences, to which he, however, pleaded not guilty. Prosecuting W/Insp. Evenly Ehiemua said that the defendant committed the offences sometime in August 2019 at the Toll Gate Mechanic Village, Oregun, Ikeja. Ehiemua alleged that Odia collected N130,000 from the complainant, Mrs. Gbemisola Benson, with a promise to help her repair the gear of her Hyundai SUV. “Odia claimed that he specialised in repairing of Hyundai car gear, a claim he knew was false,” the prosecutor added. She further told the court that the defendant, rather than effect the repair on the gear, converted the N130,000 paid by the complainant to his personal use and damaged the ignition key of the car, worth N200,000. “Attempts by Benson to get her money back from Odia were unsuccessful,” the prosecutor said. According to her, the offences contravene sections 411, 287 and 314 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. Magistrate Mrs. A. O. Daudu granted the defendant N100,000 bail with one surety in the like sum. She adjourned the case till January 30.
