MANCHESTER City’s faint title hopes suffered another damaging blow as Fernandinho’s 90th-minute own goal gave Crystal Palace a point in a remarkable finish at Etihad Stadium. Two Sergio Aguero goals in the last 10 minutes had turned a thrilling game on its head – and looked set to earn City victory – after Cenk Tosun had given the Eagles a first-half lead. But it was Palace who had the final word when Wilfried Zaha stole down the left and put in a low cross that Fernandinho reached before Connor Wickham, only to divert the ball into his own net. The draw leaves champions City 13 points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool, who have two games in hand and play Manchester United on Sunday (16:30 GMT). For long stages it appeared City would end up empty-handed, as they struggled to break down a brilliantly organised Palace side. Kevin de Bruyne had fired a first-half free-kick against the underside of the bar with the score at 0-0 but, for all the home side’s possession, they found clear-cut chances hard to come by. Palace, meanwhile, had hardly ventured forward until they scored and their determined defensive outlook was so entrenched, the City fans booed James McArthur for time-wasting as he walked over to take the corner that led to their first goal. When the ball did come over, Gary Cahill rose highest at the back post and Tosun was unmarked to steer his knockdown into the corner.
