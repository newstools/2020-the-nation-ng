 The urban renewal drive of the Ogun State government has received a new boost as the British Government  is set to start its urban renewal programme aimed at fashioning out a new master plan for Abeokuta, the state capital. The Commissioner for Urban and Physical Planning, Olatunji Odunlami, stated this in a statement made available to The Nation during a courtesy visit to the ministry at Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta by the management team of Future City Nigeria (FCN) Project. Represented by the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry, Yetunde Dina, Odunlami said the government had signed a memorandum of Undrstanding (MoU) with Future City Nigeria to develop a world-class master plan for Abeokuta, which would cover Abeokuta North, Abeokuta South, Ewekoro, Odeda and some parts of Obafemi Owode Local Government Area of the state. The commissioner expressed optimism that the plan, when implemented, would transform the entire landscape of the state, as well as reposition it to a mega city, assuring of the government’s commitment to consolidating on its status as the second largest economy and the industrial hub of the country by renewing its physical development strategy, to attract more investments. The Head, Intervention Team, FCN, Mr. Lookmon Oshodi, assured of the firm’s readiness to work with the Ministry and other relevant stakeholders to develop a master plan for Abeokuta City, adding that when a state has a proper master plan, it would attract investors, as well as create employment opportunities for its citizens.
