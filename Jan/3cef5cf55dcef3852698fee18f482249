Nigerian equities rallied net capital gains of N112 billion on Monday as the stock market reopened to continuing bargain-hunting for large-cap stocks. With profit-taking moderating the breadth of the rally, considerable gains by large-cap stocks in the telecommunications, manufacturing and banking stocks buoyed the market position. Aggregate market value of all quoted shares at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) rose from its opening value of N15.175 trillion to close at N15.287 trillion, indicating net capital gain of N112 billion or 0.74 per cent. The All Share Index (ASI)- the common value-based index that tracks all share prices at the NSE, also rose by 0.74 per cent to close at 29,633.58 points as against its opening index of 29,415.39 points. The sustained rally nudged the average year-to-date return for quoted equities to 10.4 per cent. With 21 decliners to 16 advancers, the overall market performance was due to gains recorded by MTN Nigeria Communications, UAC of Nigeria, Flour Mills of Nigeria and United Bank for Africa (UBA) among others.
