By Dupe Ayinla-Olasunkanmi  America-based Daré Olufowobi, known as Classy DJ Exprezioni, is ready to come back to Nigeria to display what he learnt in the United States. Exprezioni started disc jockeying as a student when he was in University in Lagos. “I have always loved music and how it’s being played or arranged,” he said. “So, I started by making my own personal playlists/mixes from my computer back then. “And it all got serious when I first did my DJ work at a wedding back in 2013 in Nigeria, to handling and coordinating the sounds, productions, equipment for a new club (Quilox night club), with other lounges at the time.”  Set to bring his experience back home, DJ Exprezioni, who later got involved in doing jobs for bigger events,decided to travel to the states to attend one of the DJ schools in New York to advance his craft. “But then plans changed. I saw a bigger market here in the states and decided to give it a try since I can always come back to Nigeria, if needed. I have major works with top Afrobeats artistes, and plan to make the brand, “Exprezioni”, even bigger here in the United States.” “It’s been a fulfilling experience thus far,” he said.
