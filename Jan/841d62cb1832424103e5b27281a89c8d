Lagos State Government on Thursday commenced the cashless policy for toll payments at Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge and the Admiralty Toll Plaza as earlier announced. The State Government had last year, announced that it would go cashless on toll payments at the Lekki/ Ikoyi toll plaza effective from January 1st, 2020 due to the huge traffic gridlocks often experienced on the corridor with cash payments. Commissioner for Transportation, Frederic Oladeinde, who personally monitored the cashless toll payments at the toll plaza on Thursday morning along with the Managing Director, Lekki Concession Company Limited, (LCC) Yomi Omomuwasan, stated that the new cashless policy is aimed at reducing traffic queue lengths often experienced during cash payments regime, to save travel time and ease traffic movement along the corridor. Oladeinde, who noted that the new cashless toll payments brought significant improvement on vehicular movement at the toll plaza compared with the previous situation, added that the government will continue to educate residents and motoring public on the need to imbibe the new system through compliance because of its advantage on free flow of traffic. He frowned at some motorists, whom he said, wanted to deliberately sabotage the new policy for their selfish gains, disclosing that some motorists made photocopies of their payment vouchers for multiple uses. He warned that the State Government would not hesitate to apply the law on any motorist who tried to frustrate its effort at improving traffic movements through corrupt practices. He said: “I want to appeal to Lagosians to embrace this new initiative introduced by this government as it would help us improve traffic movements along the corridor, any form of criminality or corrupt practices such as photocopying of payment vouchers or similar vices will not be condoned as such would be treated as a criminal case when caught” the commissioner warned.
