SERENA Williams will not give up on her chase for a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam title and believes she can still do it, despite crashing out of the Australian Open on Friday. The 38-year-old American legend has been stuck on 23 titles since winning in Melbourne in 2017, when she was pregnant with daughter Olympia. She has lost four Slam finals since then, but this time did not get close, dumped out in the third round by China’s 27th seed Wang Qiang. Williams, who was downbeat but not broken, said she will be back on the practice court on Saturday. “I just made far too many errors to be a professional athlete today,” she said. “I definitely do believe or I wouldn’t be on tour,” added Williams when asked if she thinks she can still reach Australian Margaret Court’s 24 Slams record. “I don’t play just to have fun. To lose is really not fun.” Williams dropped just one game in beating Wang in the quarter-finals at the US Open last year, but was stunned 6-4, 6-7 (2/7), 7-5 yesterday.
