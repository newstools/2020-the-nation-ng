 A MEMBER of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr. Ovie Wisdom Iroro, has been shot dead in Abraka, Ethiope East Council Area of Delta State. The victim, who was in his early 30s, was reportedly killed at his home about 10pm on Wednesday. The deceased was said to be having his bath when the gunmen struck. Sources said that the hoodlums dragged him from his apartment to a nearby bush where he was shot dead. While details of the motive were not clear at press time, community sources claimed that Iroro might have been killed over a misunderstanding with suspected Internet fraudsters around the neighbourhood. It was gathered that the deceased failed to keep his end of a bargain with his killers. Sources in the area, including the Chairman of Ethiope East Council Area, Mrs. Faith Majemite, confirmed the incident. Efforts to get official comments from Police Commissioner Mr. Hafiz Inuwa proved futile, as calls to his phones were not answered.
