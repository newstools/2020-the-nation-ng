Oziegbe Okoeki  LAGOS State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Sunday said his administration would help rebuild the Amu Plank Market. The market was gutted by fire at the weekend. He allayed fears of the traders that the government would take over their market. The governor spoke when he visited the market with his deputy Dr. Obafemi Hamzat and other members of his executive council. The governor said: “This is rather very unfortunate incident, nobody ever imagined this amount of destruction would happen in this market. “We will start full investigation into the remote causes of this fire incident so that we can plan in future how to forestall incident like this. “After the Lagos State Emergency Agency (LASEMA) and other agencies have finished their physical process we will come back with Ministry of Physical Planning to take inventory of the various store owners in this place and also sit with our market leaders to see what kind of lasting solution that we can bring about in markets like this. “We will do enumeration of the houses affected by the fire incident. Then the government will go back and see what support it can render. We thank God that it is only goods that were lost, no life was lost. Because we cannot equate the life of anybody to any amount of goods and services.”
