Sunny Nwankwo, Umuahia  Governor Okezie Ikpeazu has expressed shock at the news of the sudden death of the Transition Committee Chairman of Arochukwu Local Government Area, Hon.

He reportedly slumped and died on Thursday after attending to some official assignments. In a press release by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Onyebuchi Ememanka, Governor Ikpeazu described the Late Hon. Okoro as a hardworking and dedicated politician whose commitment to excellence in service was not in doubt. In Ikpeazu’s words, “Hon. Okoro had shared with me some wonderful ideas which he planned to implement in his Local Government and I was deeply impressed with his depth. His sudden death is a huge blow to me personally and our administration”. Continuing, Ikpeazu said “This death is yet another reminder to us mortals of the ephemerality of life and the inevitability of death. As such, all of us must strive to live above aboard. For those who hold public offices, we must at all times, strive to serve with diligence and honesty, as those will be our most enduring legacies should our exit time comes, as it has for Hon. Okoro”. Governor Ikpeazu sends his deepest and heartfelt condolences to the family of the Late Chairman and the entire people of Arochukwu Local Government Area, and prays the good Lord to accept his gentle soul and comfort the bereaved.
