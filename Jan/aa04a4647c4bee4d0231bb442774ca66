Facebook Inc has announced a new policy banning “deepfake” videos that are likely to mislead viewers into thinking someone said words that they did not actually say. According to Facebook, this is in a move aimed at curbing misinformation ahead of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. It would also remove misleading media if it was a result of technologies like AI that “merges, replaces or superimposes content on to a video, making it appear to be authentic,” the California-based company said in a blogpost. “This policy does not extend to content that is parody or satire, or video that has been edited solely to omit or change the order of words,” Facebook said. In the U.S., a doctored video that seemed to show the House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, slurring her way through a speech was similarly allowed by Facebook. The video, spread by Trump supporters including Rudy Giuliani, was edited, but not using any technique more complex than slowing down the raw footage and pitch-shifting the audio. Facebook has been criticised over its content policies by politicians from across the spectrum.
