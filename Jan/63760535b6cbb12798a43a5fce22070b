In Christian circles, founder of the Love of Christ Generation Church in London, Rev. Mother Esther Ajayi, doesnâ€™t need any introduction. Through her charitable gestures, she has won the hearts of many Nigerians, including Muslims and traditionalists. She came to the rescue of ailing actor, Babatunde Omidina, aka Baba Suwe, enrolled an orange hawker, Ayomide Adeoye, at Avi-Cenna International School, and got a new Toyota Hiace for Maryland Primary School, Lagos. These are just a few examples of her generousity. The prophetess, who started out as a businesswoman before answering the call of God, has now completed her church complex in Lekki, Lagos, and it would be opened for services later this year.
