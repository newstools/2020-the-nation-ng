Gunmen have abducted a woman and her 14-year-old son in Kaduna State. They reportedly broke into the victims’ home at Juji village in Chikun Local Government. The incident, The Nation learnt, occurred on Tuesday when the hoodlums invaded the community and shot sporadically. The gunmen were said to have kidnapped the woman after they broke into her home. The boy reportedly protested the abduction of his mother and insisted that he must accompany her. A resident told our correspondent that the kidnappers scaled the fence into the victims’ home. He said: “The kidnappers stormed Juji around midnight and headed for the home of their victims. “When they entered the compound by scaling the fence, they knocked the door and ordered the victims to open the door. “But when nobody responded, they smashed one of the windows in an attempt to enter the room. The burglary in the window was strong, but they broke it and entered the room. “They abducted the woman and as they were going with her, her eldest son, a 14- year-old, protested and insisted that he must follow his mother and they left with them. “As I am speaking with you, the kidnappers have not contacted the family and we are very worried since the incident occurred over 24 hours ago.” The resident said that the incident was reported at the Sabon Tasha Divisional Police Station on Tuesday and the police visited the scene and took pictures. He lamented the spate of abductions in the area. He said another member of the community was kidnapped by gunmen last Thursday. “We are living in fear. We implore the government to protect us. We are trying to come together as a community to see how we can protect ourselves from these criminals.” Police spokesman DSP Yakubu Sabo said he was still awaiting report on the incident from Sabon Tasha Divisional Police Officer.
