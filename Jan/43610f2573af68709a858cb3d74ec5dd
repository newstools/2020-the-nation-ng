 Nigeria international Kelechi Iheanacho has expressed delight after rescuing a point for Leicester City in 1-1 draw in their Carabao Cup semi-final first leg against Aston Villa. The former youth international has scored six goals in eight games this term and came off the bench to rescue the Foxes on Wednesday. Iheanacho cancelled out Frederic Guilbert’s first-half opener and was pleased to maintain his form, adding that as a striker he is focused and composed in front of goal. “It’s another goal, I’m really happy. I got the chance and I took it,” Iheanacho told LCFCTV. “As a striker you need to be focused and composed in front of goal and the chance came and we took it. “The squad did really well in the second half and the pressing we did led to the goal so we’re happy. “I think it wasn’t a bad result, we got the draw. We should’ve done better but in the second half we were a bit better. Now, we need to focus on the next games. “It’s two legs now. Of course, we have a Premier League game next (against Southampton), but I think we’ll concentrate on that then we’ll go to Villa Park and see what happens.”
