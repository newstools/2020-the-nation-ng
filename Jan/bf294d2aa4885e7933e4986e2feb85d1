Minister of state for Labour and Employment, Mr. Festus Keyamo, on Friday played down call by Senate Minority Leader Enyinnaya Abaribe for the resignation of President Muhammadu Buhari. Keyamo, a senior advocate (SAN) ,said the row sparked by Abaribe’s statement was unnecessary. “The hullabaloo over the call by the opposition for the resignation of the President is unnecessary. It’s the usual singsong of opposition all over the world,” Keyamo wrote on his Twitter handle. “They know it’s not going to happen. It’s just a way of telling govt to do more and we in govt should see it in that light.” Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity,Mallam Garba Shehu had dismissed the call for Buhari’s resignation as foolish while the President’s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity,Mr. Femi Adesina, said Buhari was fully aware of the insecurity problem in the country which was the basis for Abaribe’s statement. Adesina said the President was in control of the situation.
