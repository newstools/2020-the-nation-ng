 THE Catholic Diocese of Orlu in Imo State has raised the alarm over what it called rampant cases of people going into marriages with fake birth certificates. The church said such action had led to the annulment of about 30 marriages in the diocese. Addressing the faithful during a Holy Mass at Our Lady of Lourdes Parish, Owerri-Ebiri in Orlu Local Government, the Judicial Vicar of Orlu Catholic Diocese, Rev. Fr. Donsteve Nnagha, lamented that most of the marriages were annulled on the grounds of deceits by spouses. Fr. Nnagha, according to a Catholic newspaper, The Leader, added that deceit by a spouse, which the other partner deemed non-acceptable soon after wedding, had been a major cause of broken marriages in recent times. The cleric listed other reasons behind annulment of marriages in recent times to include forgery in the birth certificate and other sensitive documents. He said the acts, which had caused troubles in the family, were identified mostly with women. “In this situation, the man has the legitimate right to file for annulment and this will a long way in bringing peace to both parties,” the vicar was quoted as saying. He said a birth certificate is equal to the West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE), which cannot be altered, irrespective of the situation. Fr. Nnagha also spoke on the importance of baptism, which he said Jesus Christ himself participated in. He said every baptism made in the Catholic Church was always recorded and documented for future references. He warned those involved in the act of rewriting their age with a view to retaining their public offices to desist and retire from the civil service when they are due, so that the younger ones can get jobs.
