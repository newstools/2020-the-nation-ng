 The Nigerian Export-Import Bank (NEXIM) has slated its “Exporter Enlightenment Programme” for the South-south geopolitical zone in Asaba, Delta State from Tuesday, 28th – Thursday, 30th January, 2020. The programme seeks to bring together exporters, bankers, policy makers, top government officials and other operators in the non-oil export sector for the purpose of highlighting the non-oil export potentials in the south-south region. Themed “Maximising the Export Potentials of the South-South Region for Economic Growth,” the conference will be opened by the state Governor Dr Ifeanyi Okowa. The Chief Executive Officers of the Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC), the Nigerian Incentive Risk Based System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL), the Small & Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN) and the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS), among others, will present papers at the event. Also to speak at the event are various banking institutions led by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Development Bank of Nigeria (DBN), Bank of Agriculture (BoA), Bank of Industry (BoI) and the Nigerian Export-Import Bank. The highpoint of the programme will be the executive session, which will feature the Executive Governors of the six states, comprising the South-South geopolitical zone, at a panel session to deliberate and agree on the strategies to enhance the contributions of the region to non-oil exports, particularly within the context of the African Continental Free Trade Area, which has been scheduled to commence in July, 2020.
