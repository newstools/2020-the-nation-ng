 Super Eagles  striker Victor Osimhen has exclusively told  NationSport  that he  was flattered with numerous interests linking him with a possible move away from  Lille Olympique Sporting Club (LOSC). The   20-year-old has been in rich vein of form since his arrival at  the French Ligue 1 side  and has  scored  10 goals and  made three assists in 18 matches in the on-going season. His performance has commanded attention far and wide and there are speculations of a possible summer move with reported interests from European giants including Liverpool, Barcelona and Real Madrid. “I’m flatted by the interest of these great clubs,” Osimhen said in an interview with NationSport. “But currently, I’m happy in Lille and playing regularly which is one of the most important things for me as a young player. “It’s important for me so that I can improve and grow up; Lille has given me the platform   to show case my talent to the world. “I’m happy and I would like to stay here for a long time. But whatever the club wants is what I’m going to do. It’s a wonderful club with great history; the fans have been good to me and I feel at home here. “I want to continue to work towards the club’s objectives as well as my own goals,” he affirmed. Meanwhile, NationSport gathered from impeccable sources close to the former Golden Eaglets striker, that Lille are studying the situation but has not given  prospective suitors any green light. Osimhen joined  LOSC  on a 5-year contract last July  from Belgian side Charleroi for a reported 12m euros plus 3m euros in bonuses.
