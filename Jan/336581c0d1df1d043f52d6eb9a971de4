Our Reporter In mid- last December, at the Autostadt, the Volkswagen brand delivered the 250,000th electrified car since the introduction of the e-up in 2013. The brand’s electrified model range has been continually expanded in the following years: e- Golf and Golf GTE followed in 2014, the Passat GTE and Passat Variant GTE in 2015. Since 2018, the Passat and Tiguan have been available as plug-in hybrids in China, where they were followed by battery electric versions of the Bora and Lavida. The best-selling electrified car has been the e-Golf with 104,000 units delivered, followed by the Golf GTE (51,000), Passat Variant GTE (42,000) and e-up! (21,000). Half of the customers opted for a battery electric vehicle and the other half for a plug-in hybrid. The 250,000th car is a “Pure White” e-Golf. Sandra Fleischer from Herne took delivery of the car at the Autostadt in Wolfsburg in mid-December. Board Member for Sales, Marketing and After Sales Jürgen Stackmann said: “With the 250,000th electrified vehicle, the Volkswagen brand has reached a major milestone on the way to carbon- neutral mobility. Especially all-electric vehicles such as our new ID. Family are the answer to major challenges of our times. They offer considerable driving pleasure and advantages we could only dream of a few years ago. They have a carbon- neutral balance, offer more space with comparable outside dimensions, and are quiet, highly efficient, economical and inexpensive to maintain. This is why we will be selling the next 250,000 electrified vehicles in a considerably shorter period of time. At Volkswagen, we are convinced that the future is electric.” The Volkswagen brand delivered more than 70,000 electrified vehicles in 2019 – following 50,000 last year. The main sales markets in 2019 were China, Norway, Germany, the USA and the United Kingdom.
