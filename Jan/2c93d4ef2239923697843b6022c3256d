FANS of mixed martial arts will get the best of action on DSTV as Conor McGregor takes on Donald ‘The Cowboy’ Cerrone  at the T-Mobile Arena in Paradise, Nevada in the United States on Saturday. The headline bout for UFC 246, which will be live on SuperSport, sees the return of Conor McGregor (21-4-0) to the Octagon, with the Irishman taking on ‘The Cowboy’ Donald Cerrone (36-13-0, 1NC) in a Welterweight match. McGregor, known as ‘Notorious’, was last in action in October 2018 when he lost to Khabib Nurmagomedov (via submission) in a UFC Lightweight Championship bout at UFC 229 in Las Vegas. A brawl erupted inside and outside the Octagon in the wake of the fight – yet more controversy following the 31-year-old Irishman. Yet McGregor says he is focused and determined for 2020, hoping to re-establish himself as one of the best MMA fighters in the world. “I’m looking at this as a season,” he explained.  “This is the beginning of the season. Donald was the first one that I agreed to have a bout with, and here we are.” Cerrone, meanwhile, is very much the underdog after losing his last two fights to Tony Ferguson and Justin Gaethje in June and September last year respectively but remains an experienced and dangerous competitor. ‘Cowboy’ is also completely uninterested in talking trash about McGregor’s various misdemeanours outside of the Octagon: “I don’t say nothing about him. I don’t care,” the American stated. “He lives his life out of fighting, that’s his thing. I got nothing to say about it. He’s his own man. I’m going to try to get in there and mix it up with him. I’m happy to welcome him back.”
