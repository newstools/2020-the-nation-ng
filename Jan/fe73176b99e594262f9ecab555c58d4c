By Charles Okonji  THE Federal Institute of   Industrial   Research (FIIRO)   branch   of   Senior   Staff   Association   of Universities,   Teaching   Hospitals,   Research   Institutions   and   Associated   Institutions (SSAUTHRIAI) has distanced itself from the call for the suspension of the Acting Director-General (DG) of FIIRO, Dr. C. C. Igwe. The union declared as false a media publication in a national newspaper (not The Nation), on the Ph. D degree saga in FIIRO, which claimed that a faction of the agency’s union was behind thecall for  the  suspension  of  the Acting  DG of  FIIRO. ‘’The union said the  information  in thepublication   dated   January 2,   2020, did   not   originate   from   it;  that   it   was   neither   theopinion/resolution of the union executives nor an agreement by the general congress. “It is a mere pursuit of personal interest by the writer of the published script. which is a clear fact that some notable individuals who have vested interest in the seat of FIIRO Chief Executive are bent on using media publications to rubbish and tarnish the image of Dr. Igwe who has vast knowledge   and is  capable of   taking   the institute to the next   level,”the union said, in a statement made available to The Nation.  The statement said the Chairman of  SSAUTHRIAI, FIIRO Branch, Mr. Togunde Mumeen, did not speak for the union. “There is also an allegation of financial inducement on the union chairman to the tune of N2 million or more to enable him forward such mischievous report against the FIIRO boss,” it added. The  statement   further  said:  “There   is  no  indication  that   SSAUTHRIAI  is  in  support  of  this obnoxious report and has, therefore, dissociated itself from the planned action. It is unfair and saddening for a union branch chairman saddled with the responsibility of defending the welfare.’’
