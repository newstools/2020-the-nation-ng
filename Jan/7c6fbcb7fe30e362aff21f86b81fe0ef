Come January 26, Baby Balkis will be three-month-old. Unlike many babies of her age, Balkis is, however, having great difficulties with breathing. Medical experts said she is suffering from congenital heart disease (Upper Muscular Ventricular Septial Defect VSD) and small Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA). She needs urgent surgery to correct her heart defects to forestall life-threatening complications, according to a report signed by a Consultant Pediatrician with the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital (UPTH), Dr P.N Tabansi. Her parents, Mr and Mrs Alabi said the condition was noticed barely a month after she was born. They said “in November, a few days after she was born, we noticed her breath came in spasms so we knew something was wrong. “She was diagnosed with congenital heart disease (Upper Muscular Ventricular Septial Defect VSD) and small Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA). “The doctor told us that our daughter’s diseases were highly rare, complex, dangerous and almost incurable in Nigeria. “They said we would need to fly her to Fortis hospital in India, as soon as possible.” Balikis requires an immediate operation assessed at the sum of N7,000,000.
