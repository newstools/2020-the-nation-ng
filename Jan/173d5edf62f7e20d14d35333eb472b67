 The Lagos State Police Command has warned the public against disposing their vital documents carelessly through their dustbins. It said suspected criminals now gather information about individuals or corporate organisations from their dustbins. The Commander of the Rapid Response Squad (RRS), DCP Tunji Disu, gave the warning on the squad’s twitter handle monitored yesterday by the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). Disu said that suspected criminals such as fraudsters, armed robbers and kidnappers were fond of gathering information about their prospective victims from their residential or official dustbins. “Your dustbin is a goldmine for fraudsters. Average dustbins contain bank statements, utility bills, and old signed cheques, documents containing full names, addresses, phone numbers and dates of birth of your family members. “Your dustbin has bank accounts, sort codes etc. Bin raiders search your dustbins; steal your vital information for fraud. Guard your information jealously,” Disu advised.
