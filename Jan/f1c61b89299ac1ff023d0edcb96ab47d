Nigeria must feature talented athletes with heavyweight class records and good heights at the African continental level for them to be able to win laurels in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. Ferguson Oluigbo, the President of the Nigeria Taekwondo Referees Association of Nigeria (NTRAN), advised  on Tuesday in Lagos when he spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). He said that Nigeria would stand a better chance in the heavyweight categories in the African Qualification Tournament and in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics with athletes that possessed such qualities enumerated above. He added that such a team would also make the nation proud. NAN reports that athletes that will represent the continent at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games will be selected during the African Qualification Tournament. The competition will hold in Complexe Sportif Moulay Abdellah, (Palais Des Sports) Rabat, Morocco, from Feb. 22 to Feb. 23, 2020. “If we must get it right in the forthcoming continental qualifiers, then we must present formidable athletes in the heavyweight categories and they must be tall in height. “That will stand us as a big advantage at the competitions. “The Nigeria Taekwondo Federation must   make sure that its list is made up of right athletes, with distinct natural comparative advantages, for them to make an impact at the competition,’’ Oluigbo said.
