Sunshine Stars’ Israel Abia has returned to the Owena Whales after he was declared wanted by the club for leaving the team’s camp without authorisation. Abia who has missed his club’s last two league games against Lobi Stars and Jigawa Golden Stars told NationSport that he decided to return to Akure after he and the management were able to settle amicably what led to his disappearance. He said he never absconded as reported but that he went to see his ailing mother who just returned from overseas trip. “I am back in Akure to help my team. I want to put what transpired in the last few days behind me and move on in my career,” Abia stated. “I have been in Akure for three days now. I hope to start training with my teammates as soon as possible. It feels great to be back.” The head coach of Sunshine Stars, Kabiru Dogo who corroborated Abia’s claim said that the league leading scorer has not resumed training with the team because they are trying to knock him back to shape. He said the striker must be ready to fight to reclaim his shirt because some other players have overtaken him during his absence.
