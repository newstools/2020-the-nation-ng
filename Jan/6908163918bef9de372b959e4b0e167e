ANTHONY Joshua dragged Deontay Wilder on social media after the WBC champion’s former promoter claimed talks over a unification fight were always doomed. Lou DiBella, who co-promoted Wilder until 2018, worked alongside Al Haymon and the Bronze Bomber’s current manager Shelly Finkel. But after Wilder’s draw with Tyson Fury in 2018, DiBella made moves to try and come to terms with three-belt champion, Joshua. DiBella set up meeting with DAZN, Haymon, Finkel and Wilder and claims that decision cost him his position on the American’s team. The promoter insists he was exiled after that meeting, telling IFL TV: “My relationship professionally as a promoter for Deontay Wilder and working with his team ended when I set up the DAZN meeting, which is perverse. “What did I do? I tried to talk to everyone in the marketplace and make a best effort to make the most money for a guy that I cared about. ‘Isn’t that what I’m supposed to do?’ Joshua was quick to spot the news and reacted on social media by slamming Wilder. “When the loyalties gone, the truth shall prevail,” Joshua wrote on his Instagram, alongside a picture of DiBella and Wilder paired with the promoter’s comments.
