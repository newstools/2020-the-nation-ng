 NIGERIAN Civil Aviation Authority  (NCAA)  has identified interline agreement among domestic carriers as one of the ways of minimising the rising incidence of flight delays and cancellations. Interline is an operational arrangement where passengers using one ticket could board  aircraft of the cooperating carriers. Its Director, Consumer Protection, Adamu Abdullahi, who spoke  in Lagos, said the regulator has remained vocal on the proposal because of operational issues affecting indigenous carriers. He said the regulator was convinced about the option because of the barrage of complaints received  last year from passengers, whose travel plans were disrupted by either delayed or cancelled flights. Abdullahi said last November, the Consumer Protection Directorate (CPD) recorded over 427 delayed flights, three air returns, 2,209 cases of delayed or missing luggage. He said many indigenous carriers delayed or canceled flights because of insufficient aircraft on the fleet of carriers. He said local carriers are unable to sort out the maintenance schedule of their aircraft with the due dates falling at the same time at offshore facilities.
