Former international Friday Ekpo is piqued that none of the Nigerian players made it to the final round of the Africa Footballer of the Year Award which has three prominent players in the continent at the moment performing creditably for their clubs and countries. Liverpool pair Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah, as well as Riyad Mahrez from Manchester City, are the three candidates who made the final for this year’s Award, to be decided today at Hurghada in Egypt. Ekpo told NationSport that out of all the Nigerian players earlier nominated for the award, only Ndidi deserves to be in the final but unfortunately, he didn’t make it. According to him, the player has been remarkable for club and country and he has never failed to prove himself in games. “Ndidi for now is the most outstanding Nigerian player and the three players that had been picked are also doing well for their clubs. Our football has to be refined right from the grassroots. Young and talented players are the future of our football,” he said. Leicester City have abundance of attacking players, including Nigeria’s Kelechi Iheanacho, with Ayoze Pérez, Youri Tielemans and Harvey Barnes all establishing themselves in the team this year and complementing Maddison and Vardy. Pérez has formed an excellent partnership with Ricardo Pereira down the right flank, with Barnes developing a similar understanding with Ben Chilwell down the left. The full-backs are among the best in the league at providing attacking outlets from deep.  All these attacking players are able to hurt opponents because Ndidi is behind them, drifting across the midfield, winning the ball back and recycling possession.
