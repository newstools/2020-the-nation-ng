Governorship candidate of the Action Alliance (AA) in Imo State Uche Nwosu has accepted the Supreme Court judgment which declared Hope Uzodinma governor. He also debunked rumours that he plans to challenge the judgment following court decision that he was the actual governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The Supreme Court, on January 12, quashed Nwosu’s AA candidature for also being listed as the governorship candidate of the APC. Nwosu, who addressed reporters after a meeting with leaders of the Rescue Mission Structures, council and ward chairmen, as well as state executives of the APC, said he would not fight the judgment but support Uzodinma wholeheartedly. He said: “I want to state categorically that the party, including the structures in the state, have accepted the judgment which affirmed Hope Uzodinma as the governor of our state. We are not in any way fighting that judgment that has given our party the victory due it; but we shall give our unalloyed support to the new government. “We are elated that the injustice we faced at the tribunal and Appeal Court has become a thing of the past, and so we are using this avenue to praise the judiciary for still remaining the last resort of the hopeless.”
