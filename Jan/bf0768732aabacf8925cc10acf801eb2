Pensioners in Kwara State have hailed Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq for timely payment of their entitlements since assuming office in May. Executive Secretary of the Pension Board Aliyu Shuaibu spoke in Ilorin when the governor visited the board. He said the governor brought joy to senior citizens. “Pensioners are praying for you because you have brought great joy to them and their families. We have also started clearing gratuities from March 2014 where the former government stopped. This is a great thing and we are very grateful to you.” Shuaibu hinted that the state owed N11 billion in gratuities from previous years. According to him, the monthly N150 million the board gets stopped long ago until AbdulRazaq assumed office in May. He started paying N100 million monthly regularly. But Shuaibu urged the governor to enrol Kwara into the Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS) to lessen the burden of debt. The governor also visited the secretariat of Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) to inspect facility and exchange ideas with the union’s leadership.
