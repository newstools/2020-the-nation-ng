SUPER Eagles forward Kelechi Iheanacho’s time as a starter of English Premiership side Leicester could be coming to an end as Coach Brendan Rodgers says top goal scorer Jaime Vardy might be involved in today’s Carabao Cup semi-final against Aston Villa. Vardy came off in his side’s 4-1 win over West Ham last week with what was feared to be a hamstring problem and was not dressed for Leicester’s 1-0 FA Cup wins over Brentford, a game which Iheanacho scored the only goal. “He’s (Vardy) in the squad. He’s worked very hard since his injury last midweek,” Rodgers said. “We’ll give him another full day and see how he is before we decide whether he starts or comes off the bench. He’ll certainly have part to play. I think if you ask me if he’s 100 per cent, he may be 80 per cent but I’d rather have an 80 per cent Jamie Vardy with what he gives the team and the threat. “It’s also about the further risk of injury. He’s come through the last two days on the field very well and I’m very confident he’ll be involved.” Meanwhile, Rodgers believes Wilfred Ndidi is okay to start Leicester City’s League Cup semi-final second leg with Aston Villa on Tuesday. The midfielder missed the 1-1 first-leg draw with Villa, as well as 2-1 defeats by Southampton and Burnley, before making a swift return from injury against West Ham United having been expected to be out of action until early February. While the anchor-man was rested for the Foxes’ 1-0 FA Cup win over Brentford on Saturday, Rodgers expects the Nigeria international to return against Dean Smith’s side.
