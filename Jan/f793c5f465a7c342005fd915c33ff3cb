China went into lockdown on Friday after authorities and businesses scrambled to shut tourist attractions and public transport systems as part of the efforts to stop the spread of the deadly coronavirus. No fewer than 26 people have already been killed by the virus. Movement of people is being restricted in Tiananmen, Ezhou, Zhijiang, Dangyang, Qianjiang, Chibi, Xiantao, Lichuan, Jingmen, Xianning, Yichang and Enshi,according to media reports. Huanggang, close to Wuhan and home to more than seven million people yesterday announced it would shut down its public transport. Part of the Great Wall of China and Disneyland in Shanghai were closed as authorities desperately tried to stop people spreading the Wuhan coronavirus amid fears as many as 10,000 had been infected with the killer virus. Major festivities all over the country have been cancelled, including those at Beijing’s Forbidden City, a major tourist destination, and fairs and carnivals in Beijing and Hong Kong. In spite of a rising death toll, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Thursday it was “too early” to declare an international health emergency over the outbreak. The real number of patients could be much higher, as many in Wuhan are reportedly unable to receive treatment due to overcrowding in hospitals. The new coronavirus belongs to the same family of viruses that caused Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a disease that infected 8,000 people and killed 800 globally between 2002 and 2003 pandemic that also started in China. Cases of the disease have been reported in Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and the U.S., as well as in the Chinese territories of Hong Kong and Macau.
