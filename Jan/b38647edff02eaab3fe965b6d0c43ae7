TUESDAY, January 7, 2019 is a date that will live in the memories of two travellers on their way to Lagos from the eastern part of the country. The journey had been smooth until they got to the bye pass in Benin City. There they were allegedly manhandled and tortured by men of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). As relived by one of the victims, she and her husband were travelling to Lagos when they ran into some SARS men who stopped their vehicle and told them to alight from the car. They obeyed, but the SARS operatives ordered them to open the booth of the car, which they also did. They searched their booth, bags and the car. Still not satisfied, the policemen seized their phones, tried to open them and then did the unimaginable: raining curses and threatening hell.
