Cambodia’s Health Ministry on Monday confirmed the country’s first case of the new coronavirus. A 60-year-old Chinese man arrived in the coastal city of Sihanoukville on Jan. 23 from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. The man developed symptoms on Jan. 25 and tested positive on Monday, ministry spokesman Ly Sovann told dpa. The Cambodian government had earlier announced that it had placed thermal scanners in the nation’s three international airports in an effort to contain the spread of the virus.
