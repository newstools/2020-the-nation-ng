 MICHIKA (Adamawa) – A delegation of the Adamawa Government led by  Deputy Governor Crowther Seth, on Saturday  visited Michika and Madagali Local Government areas to sympathise with the people over Thursday night’s  incursion by insurgents. Addressing traditional rulers and stakeholders in Michika and Madagali, Seth said the delegation was mandated by the state governor to visit the areas to assess situation and sympathise with the people over the incident. He assured them of government commitment to security of lives and properties. “The Governor would have led this delegation himself, but he is not around” he said. He added: “He is outside the state for an official engagement that has to do with the interest of the state. “He said we should commend you for your resilience and support to security agencies and to urge you to continue to support our security personnel in their efforts to protect you.” In their responses, the District Head of Michika, Mr Ngida Zakawa, and the District Head of Gulak, Alhaji Bello Ijadi, lauded the government for the quick response in reaching out to them. They said no civilian life was lost except that the Michika branch Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Mr Lawan Andimi, was still missing since Thursday when he was seen boarding an unidentified van. They called for more deployment of security and medical personnel to the areas to beef up security and enhance healthcare delivery. Also speaking to newsmen, the Village Head of Kopa in Madagali Local Government, Lawan Luka, said the people have been digging trenches on a road regularly used by the insurgents but the insurgents always return to fill the trenches. “We want the army to send troops to our village to work with our local vigilante to contain the terrorists, ” Luka said.
