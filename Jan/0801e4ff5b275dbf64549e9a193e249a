A Federal High Court in Abuja on Monday granted a former member of the Senate, Shehu Sani, a N10 million bail, following his arraignment on a two-count charge of fraud by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). Justice Inyang Ekwo, who granted Sani’s bail application, said the former lawmaker must produce a surety, who will sign a bond of the same amount and who must own a landed property valued at N10 within Abuja. Justice Ekwo ordered Sani to deposit his international passport and told him that he could only travel outside the country with the permission of the court. The judge, who granted accelerated hearing in the matter, adjourned till February 24, 25 and 26, 2020, for trial. Dressed in a white native attire and red cap, Sani, who represented Kaduna Central Senatorial District in the Eighth National Assembly, pleaded not guilty when the charge was read to him. According to the charge, Sani allegedly collected $15,000 from a businessman, Sani Dauda, under false pretence on November 20, 2019, promising to give the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Tanko Mohammed, in order to influence some pending cases in court. He also allegedly collected $10,000 from Mr Dauda to bribe the acting chairman of the EFCC, Ibrahim Magu. A count in the charge reads: “That you, Shehu Sani, on or about November 29, 2019, within the jurisdiction of this honourable court, with intent to defraud, obtained $10,000 cash from Alhaji Sani Dauda (ASD) under the false pretence that the money was meant to bribe …Magu to arrest and prosecute Abubakar Musa, which representation you knew to be false, contrary to and punishable under Section 1(1) and (3) of the Advance Fee Fraud and Other Fraud Related Offences Act, Number 14 of 2006.”
