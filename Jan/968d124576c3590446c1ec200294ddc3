The management of Rangers International of Enugu has initiated hunt for quality strikers to strengthen the squad in order to improve the team’s dwindling performance in the on-going 2019/2020 Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) season. The management made this known after an emergency meeting with the technical crew and management at the player’s camp in Enugu, stressing that the decision was part of the ‘Performance Based’ agreement signed by both parties. It was also agreed at the meeting that all team’s strikers should be placed on forty percent less of their monthly salary until they improve on their scoring ability. The club also announced that some of its players have been sent to the ‘B’ team of the club. The club’s General Manager, Davidson Owumi stated that the situation in the team led to the decision taken by the management so as to bring out the best from the players. “I must say that this measure of sending some of you to the ‘B’ team is for you to catch up with the form we saw in you and engaged you in the first place. We need to start winning games and move out from where we currently occupy to where we rightly belong,” Owumi said. The seven-time league champions started the season on a slow pace that has seen it win one league game, drawn three and lost five of the nine matches played so far this season. The Flying Antelopes will lock horns with neighbours, F.C Ifeanyiubah today in a match day 13, NPFL fixture inside the main bowl of Nnamdi Azikiwe stadium, Enugu.
