 A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Bayelsa state, Yekini Nabena, has said that the Appeal Court decision confirming Chief David Lyon as the authentic candidate of the party in the November 16, 2019 governorship election as an affirmation of direct primary mode adopted by the party in the state. Reacting to the judgment of the three-man panel which dismissed the petition filed by former Minister of State for Agriculture, Senator Heineken Lokpobiri, challenging the candidacy of the Bayelsa State governor-elect, Nabena said the judgment was also an affirmation that the direct primaries was credible, transparent and reflected the wish of APC members on who should be the party’s governorship candidate. Nabena, shortly after the appeal court judgment, called on all APC members and indeed all Bayelsans to rally around and support the incoming administration of Lyon to take the state to greater height. While congratulating the party on the appeal court’s overwhelming affirmation of Lyon’s candidature, Nabena said “the court of appeal in delivering its verdict has sided with party members and defended their votes which they overwhelmingly gave Chief David Lyon to move Bayelsa State to the Next Level. “While Senator Heineken Lokpobiri has a legitimate right to contest the outcome of the direct primaries through legal means, it is now clear through the Appeal Court ruling that Senator Heineken Lokpobiri had no case ab initio. I now call on all who mean well for our dear Bayelsans to rally around and support the incoming administration of Chief David Lyon whose campaign development blueprint when implemented will deliver home grown initiatives to ensure progress, peace and stability of the state and indeed the Niger Delta. I invite Bayelsans to enjoy responsibly a glass of Heineken over this heartwarming appeal court ruling.”
