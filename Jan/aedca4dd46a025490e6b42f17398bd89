A middle-aged palm oil merchant in Umuahia, Mr Basil Odoemelam, who was robbed of over N1 million in broad day light in Umuahia on Thursday, has died of gunshot wounds. Odoemelam died around 6pm on Friday at the Federal Medical Center (FMC), Umuahia, where he was taken to after the attack. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported that the victim gave up the ghost in the theatre, while doctors were carrying out surgery to remove bullets lodged in his lower abdomen. The gunmen were alleged to have shot him five times in the leg and lower abdomen before dispossessing him of the bag containing the money. The deceased’s younger brother, Ejima, who was seen weeping profusely at FMC, confirmed the death to NAN.
A three-member armed gang had trailed the deceased from an old generation bank after he had reportedly withdrawn about N2 million to pay for goods supplied to him. Eyewitnesses said the gunmen, who operated in a Camry, blocked the tricycle conveying him near the General Post Office, Aba Road, Umuahia at about 3pm. The hoodlums escaped through Bende Road after the operation, while sympathisers, who thronged the scene, rushed him to FMC. The Police Public Relations Officer in Abia, SP Geoffrey Ogbonna, expressed concern over the incident and appealed to the public to assist the command with “credible information ” that would help in arresting the bandits.
