A mob on Wednesday lynched a suspected one chance robber at Katampe Extension in Abuja. Police Rapid Response Squad (RRS) operatives, who tried to intervene, were attacked by the mob and their vehicle was vandalised. One of the police officers sustained injuries. The injured policeman and the suspected robber were taken to hospital, but the latter died thereafter. A statement by the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Police Command Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Anjuguri Manzah read: “The FCT Police Command on Wednesday, January 22, 2020 , while responding to a distress call, rescued a one chance robbery suspect from an angry mob, who were about to lynch him. “It is unfortunate to state that the Police Rapid Response Squad (RRS) operatives, while responding to a distress call, met stiff resistance from the mob, who attacked the team with weapons, leaving one of the officers with serious injuries. The operational car of the team was also badly damaged by the mob. “The injured police operative and the suspect have been rushed to hospital. “The command, while assuring residents of its commitment to protect lives and property, enjoins the public to collaborate with the police in their continuous effort to combat crime and secure lives and property in FCT.” Another statement later from Manzah read: “Information has just been received that the suspect, who was receiving treatment, has passed on.”
