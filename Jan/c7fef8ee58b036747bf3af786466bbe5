Our Reporter BUDDING Afro-fusion music singer, Bello Kelvin Olamide, a.k.a Mide Bellz has disclosed how he ventured into music. The Ondo State-born graduate of University of Lagos, who launched his musical career at the age of 15 while playing drums noted that listening to Ebenezer Obey, King Sunny Ade and others as a child inspired his decision to be a musician. “When I was a kid, I wasn’t shy of doing things, I just loved entertaining basically. My dad used to play songs of Orlando Owoh, Ebenezer Obey, Sunny Ade and so on. I fell in love with the sound and I felt like I could do something like that,” said Bellz. He further said that despite his love and passion for music, he never knew he would eventually become a professional musician.  He said; “Well, I didn’t at that time, but I loved Michael Jackson, King Sunny Ade and Psquare.” Having been a dancer for the likes of Wizkid, Davido and Tiwa Savage, Mide Bellz began recording his own music in 2016. In 2017, he got signed on to popular record company, Codedtunes Africa, which was short-lived because according to him, the record label didn’t take him serious. Fortunately, luck smiled on him when in 2018 he got signed on to Samsong Music Entertainment. And with his hit song ‘Small Girl Big God’ currently making waves on radio stations and fun spots across the country, the budding singer still believes he is yet to get the attention he deserves. “To be honest, I am not getting the attention I need, but I know I will soon”, he said.
