The Amawbia community in Awka South Local Government of Anambra State has elected Nze Chinyelu Molokwu as its monarch. He replaces Igwe Mike Okoye, who died on January 2, 2018. The community elected Molokwu on Wednesday despite threats to postpone the election by some aides of Governor Willie Obiano, who stayed away from the election. Molokwu beat five contestants – Ozo Mike Akubude, Iyom Josephine, Eddy Nwokoye, Ifeanyi Emma Okonkwo and Prof Eugene Nwana. He polled 244 votes to defeat his closest rival, Nwokoye, who got 227 votes from the 13 age grades in the community. The election held after Chairman of the electoral committee, Obele Chuka Obele, insisted there was no need for postponement.   The community’s President-General, Ebele Nwufo, said Molokwu’s choice was compensation as his father was unlawfully denied the position in 1973. All government appointees from the community were absent from the election, including National Chairman of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Dr Victor Oye. But former Director-General of Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) Ikem Odumodu, Prof. Ofordile, Prof Nwana and others were present. Molokwu said he was ready for the mandate, and promised to bring peace and unity to Amawbia.
