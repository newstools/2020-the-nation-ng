 FORMER Nigeria international Odion Ighalo is reported to be under the radar of Manchester United as they try to bring in a striker on loan following the long-term injury to Marcus Rashford. Rashford’s injury has certainly left Manchester United even lighter up front following Romelu Lukaku’s departure in the summer. The club were confident of signing Erling Haaland from Red Bull Salzburg this month, but he chose Borussia Dortmund instead, going on to score a 20-minute hat-trick on his debut for the German side. Former Watford forward Ighalo is with Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua and has two years left on his contract. Ighalo scored 17 goals in 55 Premier League appearances for the Hornets before securing a move to Chinese League in 2017. After their 2-0 defeat to Burnley at Old Trafford in midweek, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer indicated that the club – six points behind fourth-placed Chelsea after successive defeats – are in need of ‘quality’ signings, with Paul Pogba as well as Rashford currently sidelined. Speaking ahead of an FA Cup tie at Tranmere, Solskjaer insisted the club was still working on reinforcements in a “difficult” market. “It’s not going to be a quick fix. And it’s not going to be like eight players in or 10 players in one transfer window,” he said. “We’ve had one proper transfer window in the summer because the Januarys are difficult, but we are trying to do something now.”
