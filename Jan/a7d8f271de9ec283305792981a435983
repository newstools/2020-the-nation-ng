Sacked chairmen of local governments in Oyo State have berated the governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Taiwo Adisa, for ‘brainwashing the people by spreading lies about their election’. The group cautioned Adisa not to be carried away with ‘transient public office’ in the discharge of his duties, saying he must follow the path of reasoning to give correct and accurate information to the people. The group spoke through its chairman, Prince Ayodeji-Abass Aleshinloye, in a statement titled ‘Replacing legality with illegality – A collective insult to the judiciary and the entire citizens of Oyo state’. The statement reads: “The ongoing cases of dissolution of the democratically elected local government councils by the Governor Seyi Makinde-led administration in Oyo State must by now appear as a witch hunt to the people. “The election that brought in the chairmen and councillors was conducted after all the legal encumbrances were cleared. But the governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Taiwo Adisa, is calling the election ‘kangaroo in nature’ and ‘against court order’. “It is disappointing and surprising when people you believe and expect should know better and guide the public are the ones misleading them because of the benefits of office that are transient in nature. “Taiwo Adisa should learn to apply brakes where necessary. He should seek caution and apply it accordingly. Four years is around the corner; his conduct as a professional journalist should be a pride to the profession and things should be done not to satisfy one’s selfish desire as he has been doing…”
