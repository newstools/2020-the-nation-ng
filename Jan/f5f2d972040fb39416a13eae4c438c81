TWO of Nigeria’s five largest commercial banking groups, United Bank for Africa (UBA) Plc and Stanbic IBTC Holdings Plc, are scheduled to meet to determine the proportion of final dividend payouts for 2019 In separate regulatory filing, the banks indicated that their directors will be meeting in the next few weeks for final consideration and approval of the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019. A major agenda of the board meeting, according to the banks, is also a decision on the final dividend to be proposed for payment to shareholders. Directors of UBA are scheduled to meet on Monday, January 27, 2020 while the board of Stanbic IBTC Holdings will meet the following week, February 06, 2020. The boards of the banks are expected to send the approved audited accounts and dividend recommendations to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), for the apex bank’s clearance, before onward submission to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) and the general investing public. Under the listing rules at the NSE, quoted companies are required to submit their annual audited account to the Exchange not later than 90 calendar days after the relevant year end, and published same in at least two national daily newspapers not later than 21 calendar days before the date of the annual general meeting. They are also required to post same on their websites with the web address disclosed in the newspaper publications. Also, an electronic copy of the publication shall be filed with the Exchange on the same day as the publication. Most quoted companies including all banks, major manufacturers, insurers, oil and gas companies, breweries and cement companies use the 12-month Gregorian calendar year as their business year.  The deadline for the submission of annual report for the year ended December 31, 2019 is thus Monday March 30, 2020. Most analysts expected the two banks, which had paid interim dividends on their audited half-year results, to announce their results and dividends before the March 30, 2020 deadline. UBA, which had paid N6.84 billion or 20 kobo per share as interim dividend to shareholders based on its first half results, was the most active stock last week at the NSE as investors jostled to take positions in the stock. Stanbic IBTC Holdings had distributed interim dividend per share of N1 for the first half ended June 30, 2019. Shareholders however took advantage of existing dividend conversion policy to convert the interim dividends ordinary shares of 50 kobo. The company confirmed that shareholders converted their interims dividends to 31.5 million ordinary shares of 50 kobo each. The new shares increased the holding company’s total outstanding shares to 10.50 billion ordinary shares of 50 kobo each. Under a resolution passed at its extraordinary general meeting in August 2016, shareholders of Stanbic IBTC Holdings may choose to receive dividends declared by the company, up to year 2020, either in cash or as new ordinary shares in the company. Most analysts expected the two financial groups to declare appreciable final dividends after third quarter earnings showed steady growths in key performance indicators. UBA sustained strong growth in key performance indicators in the third quarter as the pan African financial group grew net profit by 32 per cent to N81.6 billion. Key extracts of the interim report and accounts of UBA for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2019 showed significant growths in the top-line and the bottom-line as the commercial banking group pushed its assets base to almost N5 trillion. Gross earnings rose by 14.2 per cent to N428.22 billion in September 2019 compared with N374.8 billion recorded in September 2018. Profit before tax grew by 24.2 per cent to N98.2 billion as against N79.1 billion recorded in the same period of 2018. After taxes, net profit increased by 32.3 per cent from N61.69 billion recorded in September 2018 to N81.63 billion in September 2019.
