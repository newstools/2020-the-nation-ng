By Justina Asishana, Minna  11 persons have been killed and four women kidnapped as gunmen attacked five communities in Shiroro local government area. Kudodo, Galapai, Dnakpala Makera and Dnalgwa communities were attacked in the early hours of Saturday. The bandits were said to have moved from house to house to carry out their activities. The attack is coming barely one week after eight communities were sacked by bandits in the same Shiroro local government where a village head and 16 others were killed. One of the victims of the attack, Saidu Yisa, said that two of his wives were raped by four of the bandits in his presence before he was shot at a close range. The Senator representing Niger East Senatorial District Alhaji Sani Musa confirmed the latest attack saying that the situation is getting out of hand. The Senator lamented the incessant killings and called the federal government and security agencies to up their strategies. “As the attacks continued, more villagers in my constituency are awaiting their fate as no sign of succor seems to be coming their way. It is confirmed that the bandits are attacking all through the night to this afternoon and most communities are in grave danger,” he said.
