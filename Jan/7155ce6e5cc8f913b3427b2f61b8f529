 The Lagos State Government said on Wednesday that it would support and protect people with disabilities. Youth and Social Development Commissioner Olusegun Daudu gave the assurance at the launch of a vocational training and empowerment programme for people living with disabilities. The event was held at the Vocational Rehabilitation Centre, Owutu, Ikorodu and organised by the Lagos State Office for Disability Affairs (LASODA). Daudu said the launch of Year 2019 Disability Vocational Training and Empowerment programme was being held across three divisions, namely: Ikorodu, Badagry and Epe simultaneously, adding: “This testifies to the resolve of the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s administration to improve the welfare of people living with disability.” He said: “Today’s event marks the beginning of the skill acquisition programme aimed at making the 300 beneficiaries not only to acquire a vocation free of charge, but also to immediately become self-employed and almost fully economically independent.” The commissioner, represented by the Permanent Secretary, Yewande Falugba, stressed the need to advance the collective well-being of persons living with disabilities through training and empowerment programme that would make their lives better and give them a sense of belonging. “With the training beginning at three selected centres across the state, I enjoin people living with disabilities to embrace the training with all the serious it deserves, which without doubt will give you the opportunity to showcase your inherent skills and abilities through work of arts, vocations, trades, etc,” he said.
