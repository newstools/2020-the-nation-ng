 Barely one week after Chad withdrew its troops along the Cameroonian borders, Boko Haram insurgents have allegedly struck in the market town of Gamboru in Borno State. Thirty persons were feared killed. The Nation learnt that the terrorists blew up a crowded bridge with Improvised Explosive Device (IED) around 5pm at the peak of the market. Gamboru is one of the towns that lead to neighbouring Cameroon. It has suffered attacks by the insurgents. Eyewitnesses said that more than 35 injured people were taken to a local hospital following the attack. One of them, Modu Ali, said: “It is an unfortunate day for us to witness this frustrating and devastating incident in our community. I just heard a loud sound of explosion. Before I realised what happened, I saw that many of my friends and colleagues had been killed.” Efforts to get military authorities to comment on the incident were abortive. The Nigerian Army Operations Media Coordinator, Col. Aminu Iliyasu, responded via a text message that the area in question “is MJTF area”. The spokesman for the Multinational Joint Task Force, Col. Timothy Antigha, did not answer his calls or respond to the SMS sent to his phone.
