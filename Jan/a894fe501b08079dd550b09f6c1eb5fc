 The police in Abia State have arrested five kidnap suspects. The hoodlums had terrorised the people of Isiala Ngwa North and Isiala Ngwa South local governments and commuters within the Isiala Ngwa axis of the Enugu/Port Harcourt Expressway. The suspects are Ejike Nwankocha, 42, who claimed to be a native doctor, David Alfred, 23, Augustine Ejike, 24, Alexander Azubunne, 24, and Chide Monye, 23. Police Commissioner Ene Okon said the suspects last week boarded a commercial bus heading from Umuahia to Aba, pretending that they were genuine passengers. He said that the suspects had confessed to the crime and were undergoing interrogation. “I’m aware of the arrest of five kidnappers, who have confessed to be involved in kidnapping. They are undergoing interrogation,” Okon added. The victim, a boy, who is said to be an indigene of Umuoba in Isiala-Ngwa, was reportedly kidnapped by the men as a bait to get ransom from his rich brother, who is said to be living in Europe. It was gathered that men of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), led by their commander, SP Johnbull Obioguru, arrested the suspects at Isiala-Ngwa. The Nation learnt that the kidnappers confessed to have specialised in kidnapping and robbing people of valuables in Isialangwa, Umuahia/Aba Highway and the Owerrinta axis of the state. They also confessed to belonging to a dangerous Aro secret cult operating in Aba and its environs. It was gathered that two locally made guns, several leg chains, a battle axe, handcuffs and charms were recovered from the venue of the arrest.
