 THE Association of Retired Heads of Service and Permanent Secretaries in the Southwest, is calling for the extension of retirement age of workers in public service from 60 years to 65 years. The ex-bureaucrat said the review of the retirement age is imperative to reduce the brain-drain occasioned by early retirement of experience and well-trained public servants from service. The association applauded Governor Kayode Fayemi for repositioning the civil service through the introduction of merit-based promotion and appointment as well as e-governance into the system. This, it, said has brought about efficient and functional bureaucracy, which the association said is the fulcrum upon which socio-economic development in the state revolved. In a communiqué, jointly signed by the President, Dr. Ebenezer Okebukola and General Secretary, Barr. Fola Amure, on Saturday after its 3rd meeting in Ado-Ekiti, the association commended the southwest governors for initiating ‘Operation Amotekun’ to address the security challenges in the region. It urged the governors to ignore the declaration of the Attorney-General of the Federation, Mr. Abubakar Malami outlawing the security outfits, suggesting that necessary laws should be enacted by state legislatures in the region to give the initiative appropriate legal framework for sustainability. The communique read partly, “that the retirement of the age of the public service needs to be reviewed to 65 years in order to reduce brain-drain as result of early retirement of experience public servants. “That southwest region should initiate the process of making Yoruba language as instructional language in our schools within the region so as to promote and enhance learning and development process. And that the South West Association supported the need for restructuring the country into a true federalism considering the nation’s ethnic diversity.”
