By Mike Odiegwu, Yenagoa The Appeal Court sitting in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, has adjourned indefinitely for judgement on the case between the Bayelsa State Governor-elect, Chief David Lyon, the All Progressives Congress (APC) and a former Minister of State for Agriculture, Senator Heineken Lokpobiri. Lokpobiri has been on a running legal battle against Lyon and the APC insisting that he and not Lyon won the governorship primary election in the state. The parties in the matter including Lokpobiri, were however shocked when the Federal High Court presided over by Justice Jane Inyang in a controversial judgement delivered two days to the last year November 16 election held that the APC had no candidate for the poll. Dissatisfied that the lower court went beyond his prayers that he should be declared the authentic candidate of the APC for the poll, Lokpobiri and his lawyers filed their appeal. Also, unsatisfied with the lower court’s judgement, Lyon and the APC approached the court of appeal. It was gathered that both parties adopted their written addresses and argued their petitions before a three-man panel of the court. The Lawyer to Lyon and the APC, Karina Nathaniel, who confirmed the proceedings in the court said the panel adjourned the matter indefinitely for judgment. “We presented our arguments and the judge adjourned the matter indefinitely for judgement. A date for the judgement will be communicated to us”, he said.
