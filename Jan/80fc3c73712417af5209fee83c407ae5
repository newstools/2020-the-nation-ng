The Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) of the Abia State Police Command has arrested three men in Aba, Abia State, for allegedly dealing in cocaine. The Nation learnt that the operatives seized cocaine worth N.5m from the suspects. It was gathered that the arrest and seizure followed renewed onslaught on hard drug peddlers. The Nation learnt that the police raided the drug peddlers’ hideout at Isiala Ngwa and parts of Aba. The three suspects, Chibuzor Ogwo, 32, Joshua Nnanna, 24 and Diala Okechukwu, 30, were nabbed at a ‘bunk’ in Osisioma Local Government, off the City Centre. It was gathered that dealers in hard drugs used the Ngwa High School location during the Christmas and New Year holidays for their illicit business. SARS Commander Johnbull Obioguru was reported to have earlier in the week received intelligence report on the activities of the hard drug peddlers and he mobilised his men. It was learnt that when the operatives swooped on the area, three of the dealers were arrested, while others fled. The operatives seized some of the hard drugs, which street value was put at over N.5million. Police Commissioner Ene Okon confirmed the arrest. He said that the suspects operated from a ‘bunk’ at Isiala Ngwa and were spreading their tentacles to Aba. Okon said the command would ensure that the fleeing members of the gang were nabbed. He said the arrested suspects would be arraigned after investigation.
