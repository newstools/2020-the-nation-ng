Our Reporter  Poultry Association of Nigeria (PAN) has called for the establishment of hatcheries across the country to reduce the risk of conveying day old chicks from one destination to the other. The President of PAN, Mr. Ezekiel Ibrahim, who made the appeal in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday in Abuja, frowned at the concentration of hatcheries in a particular zone in the country. Ibrahim, who noted that hatcheries were mostly concentrated in the south west zone, described it as a major contributor to the high cost of day old chicks and a major challenge in poultry industry. “The major challenge in poultry industry is that hatcheries in Nigeria are concentrated in a particular zone, to be precise south west. So, conveying day old chicks to the north, south east takes you 36 to 48 hours which put the day old chicks under serious stress. “So as PAN, we are talking with the major hatcheries if they can now build some hatcheries in the hinterlands in different zones so that they can produce eggs in their region.  “Then when it comes to hatching they can hatch within that locality and will be easier for the birds to move to farms within a short period and that will greatly reduce the losses that could occur as a result of long journey. “Because when they are stressed, you discover farmers or some people that are not used to managing them lose large per cent of day old chicks and that will affect their profit. “Generally, it contributes to the cost of purchase of day old chick which ranges from N300 to N400 as the case may be,” he said. Ibrahim said the association was liaising with hatcheries companies in order to extend the industry to other parts of the country. According to him, such measures will ensure a stable price and the farmers can plan and make maximum profit. “We are greatly disturbed with the fluctuation in the prices of day old chicks and we are working with the system as an organisation to see how we can overcome it.
