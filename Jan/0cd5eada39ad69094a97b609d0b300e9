 “The Lekki British School (LBS) is designed and well determined to deliver world- class education in Nigeria with its wholesale adoption of the British education curriculum which is respected all over the world,”  the school’s Executive Director, Mr. Christian Idehen,has said. Speaking at the close of the last academic session of the school during a three-day concert, Mr. Idehen recalled that the vision and goal of the founder of the LBS, the late Dr. Biodun Laja “was to replicate the best of the British education in Nigeria by preparing their students to become valuable members of the global community and for a global future now that the world is a global village.” Mr. Idehen, son of the late founder, stated that the LBS was providing broad-based education to build confidence in their products so as to have something to contribute anywhere they found themselves in the world, adding that “we are equipping the students as best as we can so that they can contend with whatever situation they may encounter in the future”. The educationist criticized the Nigerian education policy whereby governments across board are quick to approve private schools regardless of the available facilities, regretting that the trend would always water down the quality and compromise standards. He called on the government to support private schools qualitatively to ensure getting world-class education institutions in place and address the issue of integrity for its impact to show in the educational system. Mr. Idehen advised the federal and state governments to ensure that the nation’s educational system conforms with the international standard through adequate funding, urging them to ensure that funds made available for the education sector are properly utilized for intended purposes. He stated that the LBS would be ready to partner the government in advancing the cause of qualitative education in Nigeria, if proper channels of communication could be opened with them.
