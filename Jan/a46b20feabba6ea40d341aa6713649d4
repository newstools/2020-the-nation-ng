 THE Nigeria Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) on Thursday unfolded plans to remove historical related liabilities from the financial records of DisCos. NERC said that the order No. NERC/196/2020 that it issued yesterday seeks to resolve the continued accumulation of future tariff related shortfalls during the transition to cost reflective tariffs and to prevent the accrual of new liabilities in the financial records of DisCos. It directed all the 11 electricity distribution companies (DisCos) to fully settle all the invoices they receive from the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Company (NBET) in line with the applicable tariff shortfall and the 2019 Minor Review of MYTO 2015 and Minimum Remittance Order for the year 2020. The essence of the order, according to the commission, is the removal of historical tariff related liabilities from the financial records of DisCos. The order which the commission posted on its website yesterday, read: “All DisCos shall settle invoices received from NBET in full as adjusted by the applicable tariff shortfall and the 2019 Minor Review of MYTO 2015 and Minimum Remittance Order for the year 2020.” The was titled:“Order on transitional accounting treatment on tariff related liabilities in the financial records of participants in the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry.” The NERC’s order also directed that all NBET invoices shall clearly indicate the amount due and payable by the Federal Government of Nigeria from multiple funding sources in the PSRP financing plan. It directed that the unpaid tariff – related portion of the NBET invoice shall temporarily remain in the books of the DisCos as a liability until same is paid to GenCos from the Payment Assurance Facility (“PAF”) or other funding sources in the PSRP financing plan. According to NERC, there shall be no interest on this liability pending the payment to GenCos by NBET. NBET, said the commission, shall apportion funds drawn under PAF or other funding sources in the PSRP financing plan to DisCos in accordance with the minimum remittance threshold approved by the Commission and issue credit notes to the DisCos in the same amount confirming that the liability has been defrayed.
