A housewife, Prosper Onyekpe, 31, who allegedly defrauded 19 people of N13.5 million, on Wednesday appeared in a Badagry Magistrates’ Court. The police charged Onyekpe, whose address was not given with two counts of breach of peace and obtaining money under false pretence. She, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. The Prosecution Counsel, ASP Nkem Ukor, told the court that the defendant committed the offence between November and December 2019, in Lagos. Ukor alleged that the defendant fraudulently obtained the money from 19 unsuspecting people uwith a promise to invest the amount in ”Preskond Investment”, a forex trade. He said the defendant conducted herself in a manner likely to cause the breach of peace by obtaining money under false pretence from the complainants. The offence, he said, contravened the provisions of sections 168 and 314 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. Magistrate Patrick Adekomaiya admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of N3, 000, 000 with two sureties in like sum. Adekomaiya adjourned the case until Feb.18 for mention. (NAN)
