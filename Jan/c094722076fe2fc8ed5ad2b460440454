  TWENTY persons suspected to be behind several violent crimes in Abia State on Tuesday paraded by the police in Umuahia, the state capital. Two women were among the suspects. A four-man gang who allegedly killed a man and his wife at World Bank Housing Estate in front of their children at the weekend was also among the paraded suspects. The couple’s killing sparked a protest and demand that the perpetrators be brought to book. It was gathered that the murdered couple, Mr. and Mrs. Darlington Uzonwa, who hailed from Ebonyi State, was killed when the hoodlums suspected that the Uzonwas knew one of them. Commissioner of Police Ene Okon said at the parade of the suspects that he led the State Puff Adder police team that went after the hoodlums after they got a hint of the incident. Okon said that some of the suspects were members of a dreaded robbery gang whose leader identified as Grave was killed late last year by the police after a failed robbery operation in the state capital. Some of the gang members include Enyinna Asiegbu (Grave second-in-command), Precious Chukwuebuka Okoro, Ogbonna Ifeanyichukwu Justice, Promise Sunday Obilor AKA ‘Esere’, and Emezuo Kingsley alias ‘Pakins’. Some of the items recovered from the gang include two Pump Action guns, two locally made short guns, three live cartridges and one expended cartridge including a sienna SUV with registration Number Abuja RBC 477 RL which they snatched from the owner to carry out the operation. An infinix mobile phone belonging to a victim was said to have been recovered from them. Okon said that the suspects as soon as investigation is concluded will be charged to courts for prosecution.
