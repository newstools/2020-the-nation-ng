Sanni Onogu, Abuja  The Senate on Thursday swore-in Senator Christopher Ekpenyong of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to represent Akwa-Ibom North-West Senatorial District in the National Assembly. The lawmaker took the oath administered by the Deputy Clerk of the Senate, Musa Abdullahi administered the oath of office and the oath of allegiance on Ekpenyong at about 10:40a.m. on the floor of the Senate. The lawmaker defeated Senator Godswill Akpabio of the All Progressives Congress (APC), in the January, 25, 2020 re-run election for Akwa Ibom North West Senatorial district, held in Essien Udim Local Government Council. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had earlier turned down the request of the APC to substitute its candidate, Akpabio, who is now the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs. Akpabio had announced his withdrawal from the race to concentrate on his duties as Minister. Ekpenyong was declared winner of the Akwa-Ibom North West Senatorial rerun election conducted last Saturday. While addressing Senate Correspondents, Senator Ekpenyong said he would work to ensure that the use of the card reader is legalized. He narrated his ordeal during the rerun elections and said that he was ready to sponsor a bill on the amendment of the Electoral Act. Ekpenyong said: “The card reader is a very strong device both in accreditation and the determination of who votes by the electorate. “It is through the card reader that we should determine the votes cast and not when you go to court and the court will say it is not recognized in law. “So, we must make sure that the card reader is recognized by law. That is the only way we can go forward in our electoral system. “I have gone through electoral processes in Nigeria and to that extent, I will come up with a bill that will change the circumstances of our electoral process to enable the people to choose their leaders and not by guns or court”.
