 Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu has promised that his government will sustain its support, kindness and provision of welfare materials to the relatives of fallen heroes to ensure that they maintain quality lives despite the death of their breadwinners. The Governor, who made the promise while speaking at the Year 2020 Armed Forces Remembrance Day Celebration Inter-Denominational Thanksgiving Service held at Chapel of Christ The Light at Alausa, Ikeja, also called for support for members of legionnaires who have been tasked with the responsibility of ensuring the security of lives and property of every resident in the country. Sanwo-Olu, represented at the event by his Chief of Staff, Tayo Ayinde said that everyone must come together to salvage the country through patriotism and mutual respect, saying that “Nigerians must play their parts individually for a greater nation, as the sacrifices made by our fallen heroes paved way for the peace, tranquility and democratic bliss being enjoyed across the country”. Quoting from the Book of Psalms Chapter 85 Verse 8, he said that God already had a pact of peace with Nigeria as evident in the peaceful nature of the country in spite of several threats to its security and oneness. He, however, warned against nepotism, hatred and intolerance, adding that such cannot guarantee a peaceful co-existence. In his sermon, the Prelate Emeritus, Methodist Church of Nigeria, His Eminence, Dr. Sunday Ola Makinde called for provision of necessary ammunition for the officials of the armed forces to enhance their peacekeeping mission and the task of protecting lives, property and the territorial integrity of our nation.While noting that tolerance remains the bedrock of security and peace in Nigeria, he implored Service Chiefs to remember those who have not fallen but whose entitlements are being denied or withheld, just as he challenged the leadership of the armed forces to see to the welfare of the relatives, wives, husbands and children of the fallen heroes. The prelate also prayed for the Lagos State Government led by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, admonishing the administration to keep its focus on education, health, free vehicular movement and other impactful projects which had already commenced. He remarked that the present administration has started well in bequeathing good governance to the citizenry, saying that the improvement in security across the length and breadth of the State is a visible testimony of the giant strides of the government.
