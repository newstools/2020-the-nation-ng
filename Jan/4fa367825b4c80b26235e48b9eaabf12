The Agbarijo Egbe Odo Yoruba (Grand Council of Yoruba Youths) has urged Nigerians to support its ‘2023 is Yoruba Turn and Non-Negotiable’ movement. It said the ‘2023 is Yoruba Turn and Non-Negotiable’ movement is a ‘moving train which is best described as the last plane of political Salvation for 2023 election’. The group’s Aare Apapo (President-General), Comrade Awa Bamiji, in a statement on Monday, thanked Nigerians for the ‘unflinching’ support. He said: “The solidarity is well appreciated…across the ethnic, religious and political divides and we can assure you, ‘it’s no retreat, no surrender’. “We, Agbarijo Egbe Odo Yoruba, Grand Council of Yoruba Youths, are always seeing light at the end of the tunnel. Interestingly, those in opposition are our fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters, but they just need to test the waters, in order to know how competent they are in negotiating their way up intellectually, but from the first step outside their door, their claims were punctured by our superior arguments. “This is the beauty of democracy.”
