Elo Edremoda, Warri  Another member of the Peopleâ€™s Democratic Party (PDP), Mr. Ovie Wisdom Iroro, has been shot dead in Abraka, Ethiope East council area of Delta state. The victim, who was in his early 30s, was reportedly killed at his residence about 10pm on Wednesday. The deceased was said to be having his bath when the gunmen struck. Sources said that the hoodlums dragged him from his apartment to a nearby bush, where he was shot dead. While details about the motive were not clear as at the time of filing this report, community sources claimed that Iroro may have been killed over a misunderstanding with suspected internet fraudsters around the neighbourhood. It was gathered that the deceased failed to keep his end of a bargain with his killers. Until his death, Iroro was a member of the social media team of the PDP for Ethiope council. Several sources in the area including the chairman of Ethiope East council area, Chief (Mrs) Faith Majemite, confirmed the incident. Majemite, who decried the gruesome murder of the PDP supporter, said she was already working with the Divisional Police Officer in Abraka to get those behind the killing arrested. Meanwhile, efforts to get official comments from the Commissioner of Police, Mr Hafiz Inuwa, proved futile, as calls to his phones went unanswered.
