Micro Pension Plan refers to an arrangement under the Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS) that allows the self-employed and persons working in organisations with less than three (3) employees to make financial contributions towards the provision of pension at their retirement or incapacitation.  Micro Pension guarantees secured future through steady income at retirement. It reduces old age poverty and the process is easy, simple and flexible.  Yes, Micro Pension Plan has been successful in countries like Ghana, Kenya and India.  The mandatory pension and Micro Pension Plan are arrangements under the Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS). The only difference between the two is the nature of participation. Thus, the mandatory pension is obligatory for all eligible employees and both the employer/employee contribute towards the payment of the employeeâ€™s pension at retirement. Micro Pension on the other hand is voluntary and solely funded by the contributor.
