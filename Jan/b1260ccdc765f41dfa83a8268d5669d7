 Muslims Students’ Society of Nigeria (MSSN) Lagos State Area Unit has expressed displeasure about the process of enrolment of students for their National Identity card with the National Identity Card Commission (NIMC). Since the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (Jamb) mandated National Identity Number (NIN) as prerequisite for registration, MSSN Amir (President) Dr. Saheed Ashafa said the students have been subjected to undue stress while applying to register for the exercise. Ashafa spoke in Epe, Lagos during the closing of the society’s 108th annual Islamic Vacation Course (IVC). He said Nigerians wake up at midnight and even abandon their businesses while students equally abandon schools and classes in order to secure a place for early registration at the centres. “We should not forget that NIN is now a condition attached to registration for JAMB, hence, NIN registration centres are congested without any hope of success in the process,” he said Ashafa bemoaned the fact that the process is marred by extortion, bribery and all forms of corrupt practices. He suggested that adequate monitoring and check and balance be put in place to solve logistic issues and ease the process. Dr. Ashafa urged the regulatory authority, NIMC, to ease the affairs of the people and not the other way round. The problem, he said, must be addressed immediately to rekindle the hope of Nigerians in the exercise.
