The General Manager, Lagos State Materials Testing Laboratory (LSMTL), Mr. Olalekan Ajani, has urged stakeholders in the building sector not to compromise safety standards. Speaking at a meeting with officials of the Lagos State Building Control Agency (LASBCA), Ajani said that LSMTL, as a regulatory body, would ensure a better and safe environment. He said Cocoa House in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, is one of the oldest buildings in the country and it is still in good condition because of the quality of the materials used to build it. Ajani said some independent laboratories did not have the interest of the state at heart, adding that all they were after was profit. He warned developers to be wary of the materials they used for construction. LASBCA General Manager Abiola Kosegbe hailed the LSMTL initiative, saying the meeting was long overdue. She said that it was good to have synergy with the agencies in the building sector. “The government and LASBCA cannot do it alone; we need relevant agencies to work with as a team. The mandate of our agencies is to prevent building collapse and ensure they (buildings) have development permit, which is very important,” Kosegbe said.
