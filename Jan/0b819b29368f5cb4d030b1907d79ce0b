 ENUGU Rangers’ Ibrahim Olawoyin believes that the Flying Antelopes have overcome their recent challenges after they secured their first victory in 10 games. Olawoyin scored two goals to help the 2018 Federation Cup Champions to a 3-1 home win over FC IfeanyiUbah and the attacker told NationSport that they are targeting another home win as they welcome Mauritanian side, Nouadhibou FC to the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium, Enugu in a CAF Confederation Cup Matchday Four tie tomorrow. The former Abia Comets striker hinted that they were all bothered when results weren’t going their ways but that they were aware it was only a temporary setback because they have been playing well. “It was a big relief to return to winning ways after a long while. We have been playing well but results have refused to favour us until we got this win,” Olawoyin stated. “We headed to the dressing room with regrets after they equalised close to the end of the first half. The coach told us to continue what we have been doing with more aggression and it paid off. “We hope that this win will be the beginning of something positive to come in the league and in the CAF Confederation Cup. We are expecting another victory against Nouadhibou tomorrow to show everyone that we are truly back.” Rangers are third in the Africa’s second tier club competition with one point from three games and only a positive outcome against the Mauritanian side will keep them within touching distance of Pyramids and Al Masry of Egypt.
