By Tajudeen Adebanjo  Jaiz Foundation has extended its intervention in the education sector to Kano State. Jakara Primary School, one of the oldest schools in Kano, was the beneficiary. The Nation learnt that in a response to the school’s request for intervention in areas of infrastructure, Jaiz Foundation donated 60 set of 3-seater classroom furniture. The School Management Committee and Parents Teachers Association (PTA) were happy to receive the donation from the Jaiz team two weeks ago. During the handing over of the furniture, Chairman, Board of Trustees of Jaiz Foundation, Mallam Adamu Bello, said the intervention was for the benefit of the pupils. He prayed to Allah to make it a source of blessings to the school.  Represented by the Chief Executive Officer of the Foundation, Dr Abdullahi Shuaib, Mallam Bello said: “This is not the zenith of the donation of Jaiz Foundation to Jakara Primary School but the starting point. With many more opportunities, the foundation would be able to do better in future.” A member of Board of Directors of Jaiz Bank Plc, Alhaji Mukhtar Sani Hanga, who also played a key role in facilitating the intervention to the school, witnessed the presentation. Jakara Primary School PTA Chairman Alhaji Na’aba Abubakar thanked the foundation for the gesture.
