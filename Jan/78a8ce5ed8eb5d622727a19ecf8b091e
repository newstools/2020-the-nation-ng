The newly appointed Postmaster-General of the Federation and Chief Executive Officer of Nigerian Postal Services (NIPOST), Dr. Ismail Adebayo Adewusi, has said his appointment by President Muhammadu Buhari is to make him leave a strong legacy at the organisation. He promised that in 100 days of his assumption of office, Nigerians would witness a huge impact on government’s desire to change the face of NIPOST. Adewusi spoke on Tuesday during his maiden meeting with the management and workers of the company at its head office in Garki, Abuja. Saying he was aware of the enormous challenges facing NIPOST, Adewusi urged the workers to note that their contributions could not be divorced from the fortunes of the organisation. The postmaster-general reminded them that no organisation can make any meaningful impact if its human resources are not properly harnessed in tandem with its goals. “Those familiar with me know that wherever I go, I leave very strong legacies and NIPOST won’t be an exception,” he said. Adewusi said he was aware there were many issues confronting NIPOST, adding: “They are well known to most of us and I can tell you that the challenges are enormous.” According to him, breathing life back into dying and troubled organisations and business concerns has been his major area of interests in the public and the private sectors where he had amassed a lot of experience. “In Lagos State, where I served as Commissioner for Finance under Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) that government inherited was just about N600 million monthly. However, by the time we were leaving, we had been able to raise the IGR to N10 billion monthly. That was what subsequent administrations that came after us had built upon, which I am sure has hit about N30 billion mark monthly. That is the orientation that I have come from.”
