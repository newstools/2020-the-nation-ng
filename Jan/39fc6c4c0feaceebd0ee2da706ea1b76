Damian Duruiheoma, Owerri  The All Progressive Congress (APC) in Imo State has dissociated itself from the failed invasion of the 27 council areas in the state by suspended Chairmen and councillors on Monday. The party said it could not confirm the membership status of the suspended council officials in the state APC. The suspended officials had relied on the Supreme Court judgment delivered in the suit between the Ekiti state Governor and the Council chairmen to invade the councils in Imo State. The incident left one person dead in Isu LGA and many others wounded across the 27 council areas of the State as the police and youths combined to repel the invading forces. Briefing journalists in Owerri on Tuesday, the APC state publicity secretary, Enyinna Onuegbu said that the matter between the suspended Imo State LGA Chairmen and councillors versus the State government was still in the courts and were yet to be decided. He added that the party in Imo State believed in rule of law and respect for court judgements and therefore could not have endorsed anyone or group to resort to self-help in order to get justice. According to Onuegbu, “the Ekiti State LGA Court judgment is not applicable in Imo State until same is affirmed by the Court sitting on that of the Imo State counterpart. “APC and the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria believe in the rule of law, APC is not part of the gang-up by some desperate politicians to take over the Imo State LGA administration by force. ” Imo State APC was never at any time informed, carried along or supported the event and the actions of the suspended LGA Chairmen. It is a total embarrassment to us the executive members of the party. “No loss of life is worth any political agenda”, he said in address. He, therefore, advised the youths not to allow themselves to be used by desperate politicians to breach the peace in the state.
