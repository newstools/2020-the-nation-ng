Members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Imo State on Sunday took to the streets of Owerri to protest the Supreme Court sacking of Emeka Ihedioha as Governor. The protest, which was monitored by security agencies, inevitably caused heavy traffic within the city. The protesters converged on the party secretariat on Okigwe road in black attires with caps, chanting party songs with placards which bore various inscriptions. They finally settled at the Okigwe road roundabout adjacent to the Government House Owerri. The Imo state operation joint task force took the rear while the protesters moved on. Some of the inscriptions on the placards read “Ihedioha won landslide”, “Tanko must go and Tanko is corrupt”, “reverse the injustice now”, “we don’t want to go back to Egypt and judiciary save democracy or die forever”. Chief Chris Okewulonu, Chief of Staff to Emeka Ihedioha and the State Secretary of the party Nze Ray Emeana who jointly spoke to newsmen said the protest was in response to the ruling of the Supreme Court which voided the election of Ihedioha.
