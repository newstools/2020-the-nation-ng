An Ilorin based legal practitioner, Mr Johnson Ekundayo has said campaign for gender equality would become a threat to marriage in Nigeria if not properly handled. Ekundayo, who revealed this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday in Ilorin, added that such campaign would also cause domestic violence in most marriages. According to him, a call for gender equality was a potential threat to marriages as some women will see such as a platform to compete with their husbands in various respects. “Gender equality would be wrongly interpreted by some women as equal right with their husbands or spouses, and this will ultimately lead to marital crisis. “I do not see anything bad in gender equality, but it poses a threat to the future of marriages in Nigeria, because our present generation may wrongly interpret the word `equality’. “I don’t hate gender equality. It is good for development of the country but not to be extended to matrimonial union,” he said. The lawyer also called on women to be submissive to their husbands by not dragging equal right in their union all in the name of gender equality. He also advised husband to love their wives and desist from maltreating and discriminating against women in general. (NAN)
