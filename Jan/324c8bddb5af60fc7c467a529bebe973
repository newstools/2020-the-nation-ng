A month after the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) queried eight power distribution companies (DisCos) to explain why their licence would not be revoked, the regulator appears undecided over the fate of the firms. The affected firms areAbuja, Enugu, Benin, Ikeja, Kaduna, Kano, Port Harcourt and Yola. NERC had given the firms 60 days ultimatum to explain why their licence would not be revoked for breaching the terms in the Electric Power Sector Reform Act of 2005 and 2016-2018 Minor Review of Multi-Year Tarriff Order and Minimum Remittances Order for 2019. It was gathered that many of the firms had written to the Commission. Spokesman, Ikeja Electric (IE), Mr Felix Ofolue, confirmed this. Also, the Head, Communication Department, Enugu Electricity Distribution Company( AEDC), Mr Emeka Eze, said his firm has responded to the query. According to him, the firm even attended the public forum organised by NERC in Abuja late last year. He said: “We are yet to receive the outcome of the query sent to the Commission.Like other stakeholders in the electricity distribution value chain, AEDC has not been briefed on the issue.We are waiting for the outcome. May be NERC is still working on the query.” Industry source said the decision by the Federal Government to come out with an ultimatum might not be unconnected with plans to return the sector to productivity. The source said: “Investors spent billions of naira to purchase the unbundled  assets of the defunct Power Holding Company of Nigeria( PHCN).  The money is huge and it would be difficultlt for the government to pay back. “The country is broke. The government is still finding it difficult to finance the budget. Where do you expect the government to get the money to pay back investors in the event that it revokes their licences?”
