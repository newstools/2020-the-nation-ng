A 24-year-old musician, Chimaobi Elele, on Thursday appeared before a Yaba Chief Magistrates’ Court in Lagos, for alleged membership of an unlawful society and breach of the peace. Elele is facing a three-count charge of conspiracy, breach of peace and belonging to an unlawful society. He, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. The Prosecutor, Sgt. Modupe Olaluwoye, told the court that the defendant committed the offences with some others still at large at 5.43p.m. on Dec. 24, 2019, at Ajegunle-Apapa area of Lagos. Olaluwoye said that the defendant belonged to a cult known as “Aiye”. She said the defendant and his accomplices were fighting and breaking bottles; disturbing the peace of the neighborhood and chasing some church members holding a crusade. Olaluwoye said that a church member called the police and the defendant was apprehended, while the others escaped. She said the offences contravened Sections 411, 42 (a) and 168 (d) of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015 (Revised). The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Section 42 (a) stipulates three years jail term for belonging to unlawful society, while 168(d) prescribes three months for breach of the peace. The Chief Magistrate, Mrs Oluwatoyin Oghere, granted the defendant bail in the sum of N50,000 with two sureties in like sum. Oghere said that the sureties must reside within the court’s jurisdiction. She said that the sureties should be gainfully employed, with evidence of three years’ tax payment to Lagos State Government. Oghere adjourned the case until April 17 for mention. (NAN)
