Ashley Young has completed his move from Manchester United to Inter Milan on a six-month deal with an option to extend for a further year. Ashley Young is officially an Inter player. The 34-year-old English defender arrives from Manchester United and has signed a contract lasting until 30 June 2020 with an option to extend for a further season. No transfer fee has been revealed but according to several sources in Italy, Inter have paid Manchester United €1.5 million to secure the services of the former Aston Villa man, a fee that will increase every time Young plays for the Nerazzurri. Ashley Young’s contract with Manchester United was due to expire at the end of June 2020 but the Nerazzurri wanted to add him to the fold for the second half of the season and so they negotiated this deal with the Red Devils. Ashley Young joined Manchester United from Aston Villa ahead of the 2011/2012 season for a reported fee between £15-20 million and has since then featured 261 times across all competitions scoring 19 goals in the process.
