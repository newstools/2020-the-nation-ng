By Taofeek Babalola Anthony Okpotu has revealed his ambition to finish career at former club Lobi Stars of Makurdi. The Nigerian international, who is currently playing for Tunisian club side US Monastir, started his career at Lobi Stars. The forward bagged the Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL) highest goalscorer award after scoring 19 goals for Lobi in 2016-17 season. While in Makurdi, Okpotu netted 71 goals for Lobi Stars and he has expressed his desire to come back to the team in the final season of his career to increase his goal tally to 80. “71 goals for @LobiStars in the @npflsoccer @LMCNPFL 1st goal was against @NigerTornadoes (Header) and the last (FOR NOW) was against @RangersIntFC (Free kick). I need to make it round figure 80GOALS; Final season of active football I’ll make it happen,” Okpotu tweeted. Okpotu started with Lobi Stars before he moved to Al-Ittihad Tripoli, Libya in 2013/2014 season. In April 2018 he had a trial at Danish club Brøndby before he joined Morocco side Difaâ Hassani El Jadidi in July same year and after failing to command regular shirt at the Morocco side, he was loaned out to Albanian club KF Laçion in January 2019. The former NPFL goal-king joined Union Sportive Monastirienne of Tunisia from Morocco side Difaâ Hassani El Jadidi on a two-year deal in August last year. The Makurdi-born striker played a crucial role as Nigeria emerged runner-up at the African Nations Championship (CHAN) in Morocco in 2018. He scored twice during the tournament.
