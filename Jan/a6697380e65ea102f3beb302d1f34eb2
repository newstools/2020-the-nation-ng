 PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari has again reiterated his commitment to the peace, stability and development of the West African sub-region. Buhari re-echoed his commitment yesterday at the State House, Abuja, while hosting the President-elect of Guinea Bissau, Umaro Muhktar Sissoco Embalo, who was on a “thank you visit”. The President, according to a statement issued by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, said he would continue to invest in the stability of the region, noting that there can be no development without stability. President Buhari said: “Without stability, there can be no development. We will do whatever it will take to stabilise the sub-region.” Buhari commended the out-going President, José Mário Vaz, himself a candidate in the elections for supporting the emergence of Embalo in the second round of balloting “in the interest of peace and stability”. He said history would remember Mario Vaz for putting national interest above his own, emphasising that he cared for peace within the region. The Nigerian President expressed his desire for both countries to work together for the betterment of their peoples and reiterated his vision for peace, progress and prosperity in West Africa. Embalo, a businessman-turned politician, was Prime Minister of Guinea Bissau under Mario Vaz between 2016 and 2018. He was a member of the ruling African Party of Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) when he founded the Movement for Democratic Alternative (MADEM-G15) on which platform he won the elections. He praised Buhari for his support leading to his emergence as winner in the elections and expressed his appreciation for the warm and friendly disposition of Nigeria towards him and the people of his country. He invited the Nigerian leader as the Guest of Honour at the presidential inauguration coming up next month and for which he received assurances from Buhari that he will make the best efforts to be present.
