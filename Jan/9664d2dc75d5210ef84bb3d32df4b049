The National Association of Yoruba Descendants in North America has applauded the Amotekun initiative. For the Southwest governors and other stakeholders to pull off the new security, the group said the outfit is a demonstration of their fidelity to the oath they took to protect the lives and properties of residents. “Our association applauds their commitment and dedication. Unfortunately, there are some political appointees whose understanding of the law and constitution is so abstract and puerile that it has nothing to do with the people whose interest laws and Constitution are originally and normatively established to protect. If an outfit established for the protection of lives is deemed unconstitutional, we fail to understand the legitimacy of such a Constitution. We are watching, and we will remember not only the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends,” Its President Durojaye Akindutire said in a statement. Egbe Omo Yoruba enjoined the governors and stakeholders to hold the fort “because the entire citizens of Yorubaland have their backs. If Hisbah has been operating since 1999 and it is not deemed unconstitutional, Amotekun has a right to protect the people of Yorubaland from violent marauders who have not been-effectively deterred by the existing federal security operatives.” Egbe Omo Yoruba said that every state assembly in the Southwest should urgently pass the enabling laws to validate the establishment of Amotekun as a joint venture of the region, adding “The peace and prosperity of Yorubaland and Nigeria can only be advanced by this bold initiatives.”
