 Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer swept into the Australian Open quarterfinals but 15-year-old Coco Gauff exited in tears yesterday after her quest to become the Open era’s youngest grand slam winner came screeching to a halt. As Melbourne marked Australia Day with formation jets and a 21-gun salute, world number one Ashleigh Barty had home fans celebrating before crowd favourite Federer dismantled Marton Fucsovics in the night match. Djokovic, hunting his eighth Melbourne title, was remorseless against Argentina’s Diego Schwartzman, crushing the 14th seed 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 to book an 11th appearance in the last eight. The Serb’s reward is a match-up with big-serving Canadian Milos Raonic, who is back in form after a run of injuries and dismissed 2018 finalist Marin Cilic 6-4 6-3 7-5. “I’ve got to be ready for missiles coming from his side of the net,” said Djokovic, the 16-time grand slam winner. Gauff’s giant-killing Australian debut generated hype dubbed “Cocomania” as she attempted to become the youngest major winner in the post-1968 open era, breaking the record set by a 16-year-old Martina Hingis in 1997.
