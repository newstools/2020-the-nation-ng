 NATIONAL Examinations Council (NECO) has sought the help of the Department of State Services (DSS) to check malpractices during the conduct of its examination. NECO’s Governing Board Chairman Dr. Abubakar Saddique made the request when he led the Acting Registrar of the council, Abubakar Gana, and other management team on a courtesy visit to DSS Director-General Yusuf Bichi in Abuja. In a statement on Thursday by NECO’s Head of Information and Public Relations, Azeez Sani, the NECO chairman said such collaboration would ensure the credibility of its examination. Saddique, who said the council had put in place measures for checking examination malpractice, noted that without an effective security system, such measures would not yield the desired results. He added that among the measures introduced was the biometric capturing of candidates to check impersonation at examination centres. The chairman urged the DSS to strengthen collaboration with NECO to prevent any form of malpractice before, during and after the conduct of the council’s examination. Gana recalled that the council enjoyed the full support and co-operation of DSS through the provision of covert operations which helped in reducing examination malpractice. He said: “The world is experiencing rapid changes, resulting from rapid development. These changes revolve around two major phenomena of emerging technology and globalisation.” Gana urged the DG to ensure that fraudsters who attempt to compromise NECO examinations are not only arrested and investigated but also prosecuted to serve as deterrent to others. Bichi pledged the continued support of his agency to ensure credibility of NECO examinations.
