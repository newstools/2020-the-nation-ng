Speaking to newsmen, Amokachi expressed delight to be at the launch of the competition which he said will go a long way to improve football in Oyo state and the nation as a whole. “I am honoured to be in Ogbomosho today and I am sure my colleagues are too. When the  Minister was announced as the Minister Of Youth and Sports Development, we all applauded it. Going by his background and the fact that he himself is a young man, we were sure that we were in good hands. “This is someone who has passion for the youth. All the Ministers who have come into the Nigerian Sports environment have mistakenly set their only focus on the Nigerian Super Eagles but now we have a Minister is doing all he can to touch every sport. The youth development mandate that has been neglected for a very long time is getting his touch. Grassroot  football too, is very important because I am a testimony to what can happen if we catch them young. I was picked to play for the Super Eagles at the age of 15. Taribo West and Yobo too and I think that’s where the Minister is looking at.” He urged leaders at all levels to take Youth Development seriously. “We must all focus on the youth who we always say are leaders of tomorrow, I believe they are the leaders of today because the focus is today as tomorrow is in the hands of the Lord.” He concluded by thanking the Minister and urged him to keep up the good work assuring him of the support of all progress lovers.
