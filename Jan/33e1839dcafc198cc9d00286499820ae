 THE Army has said its troops on Operation Lafiya Dole have continued to degrade Boko Haram and Islamic State for West Africa (ISWAP) terrorists in the Northeast. The Media Coordinator, Col. Aminu Iliyasu, in a statement on Sunday, said some terrorists’ informants were recently arrested. According to him, troops of 159 Battalion deployed in Geidam Local Government Area of Yobe State had an encounter with the terrorists on January 19 and neutralised some criminals. He hinted that many of the insurgents are believed to have escaped with injuries, while two AK-47 rifles, five magazines and 45 rounds of 7.62mm Special ammunition were recovered. Col. Iliyasu added that the Joint Tactical Team deployed in Borno and Yobe States arrested a female Boko Haram recruiter (Zainab Usman) at Modu Sulemri area of Abujan Talakawa Ward of Maiduguri Metropolitan Council. Preliminary investigation showed that the suspect is a wife of Alai Usman, a high profile ISWAP logistics supplier. According to him, the suspect is believed to be in contact with other high profile Boko Haram/ISWAP commanders, helping them to recruit young fighters. He added: “This month, troops of 212 Battalion deployed in Auno, Kaga council of Borno State, in conjunction with elements of Civilian Joint Task Force, arrested Ahmed Yakuba, a high profile Islamic State West Africa Province informant at a location south of Auno Village. “Preliminary investigation showed that the suspect was born in Niger Republic, grew up in Sudan and has been in Nigeria in the last 15 years. However, during interrogation, the suspect confessed to being a spy for the Islamic State’s West Africa Province criminals on a mission to spy on troops’ location in Auno and other locations along the Maiduguri–Damaturu Road.”
