By Chinyere Okoroafor  The Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG) has conducted a study on the impact of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) on key macroeconomic variables. It noted that AfCFTA represents one of the most ambitious attempts of the African heads of states and governments to economically unite the people and economies. It the first step in the implementation of African Union (AU) Agenda 2063, which is the vision for an integrated, prosperous and peaceful Africa. NESG said it recognises AfCFTA’s potential to broaden and strengthen the scope for intra-African trade as well as improve the well-being of African people. It is on this premise that it conducted impact assessment studies of the AfCFTA on Nigeria’s industrial sectors, agriculture sector and the economy. NESG Head of Research, Dr Olusegun Omisakin, said the analysis was done under six policy simulation scenarios, including the linear cut in tariff over the 10-year AfCFTA implementation period. He said: “The results indicate that the AfCFTA will be trade-diverting as Nigeria’s imports from non-African countries will be substituted by imports from African countries. “Overall, one thing that is certain is that AfCFTA would turn out in one of two outcomes; a win-win outcome for all African countries, or a zero-sum game in which case the gain of one country becomes the loss of another, or the loss of one country becomes the gain of another.”
