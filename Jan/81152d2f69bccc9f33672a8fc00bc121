From Juliana Agbo, Abuja  An agriculture stakeholder Dr Abiso Kabir has advocated for favourable policies to drive export. Kabir who spoke on yesterday in Abuja during an interview with The Nation said the inability to export most produce from the country has been attributed to the inability of farmers to meet relevant international requirements on the health of plants that are meant for export, a development that is impeding foreign trade between Nigeria and other countries. The agriculture expert who is also  the Managing Director of  Wal-wanne Group, said the challenges in the sector are daunting and one of such is the inability of farmers to efficiently export some of their produce. “We are the largest yam growing nation, yet we export non, Ghana is taking the lead now in yam export,” he said. He stated that there was need to export agricultural products to help improve the standard of living of the people. “The need to get everybody in agriculture has been one of the cardinal points of the Economic Recovery Growth Plan (ERGP) of the Federal Government with emphasis on developing and export led economy. “It is not only crude oil that keeps the Nigerian economy growing, we need to increase our export to generate more revenue and balance our trade.  “The agricultural sector that gives rise to various products is also the base of the Nigerian economy. “With the new mechanisation in agriculture, we have increased output. Some of our products are exportable and there are of high demand, our products are highly nutritional,” he said. Kabir who also said Wal-wanne rice which produces 120 tons of rice per day, has been able to create employment opportunities to women and youths. “We will continue to showcase agriculture to unemployed youths as an enterprise and the imperative of returning to the farm to guarantee wealth creation and food security,” he added.
