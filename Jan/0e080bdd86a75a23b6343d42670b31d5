Our Reporter  CHIEFTAIN of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abia State, Chief Sam Nkire, has predicted the defection of politicians,  especially from the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), into the APC, in the coming months. He made the prediction in Aba, Abia State, shortly after a reconciliatory meeting with some party chieftains. Nkire, therefore, urged party faithful in Abia State to keep an open mind to receive the great multitude wishing to be part of the APC family nationwide, adding that “Abia State, in particular, should be ready for a bumper harvest of progressive men and women.” The Abia State APC Caucus Leader, who is also a member of the National Caucus of the party, appealed to aggrieved persons in the party to sheath their swords and work for the success of the party in 2023. Nkire made the appeal during a meeting held in Aba to reconcile two senatorial candidates, Sir Marc Wabara and Dr. Nyerere Anyim, who had been at daggers drawn since last year’s elections.  According to him, although the Supreme Court had delivered judgement and concluded the matter, it failed to deliver peace to the APC family in Abia State. Nkire said an ad-hoc reconciliation committee would soon be instituted to ensure that disunity among members become things of the past. He urged party leaders to call their supporters and attack dogs to order, “so that the situations prevalent are de-escalated to the bearest minimum, in order to keep the party united as one.” He thanked Sir Marc Wabara, former Managing Director of Hallmark Bank and Dr Nyerere Anyim, former National Vice Chairman Southeast APC,  for accepting the wish of the leadership to bury the hatchet.
