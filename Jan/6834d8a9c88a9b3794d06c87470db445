 World silver medalist, Odunayo Adekuoroye gave Nigerians what to expect at Tokyo 2020 as the she was faultless from the round of 16 to the final to claim the gold medal at the first of two United World Wrestling (UWW) Ranking Series events, the Matteo Pellicone. To win the gold, the Ondo State-born wrestler claimed a superior 10-0 points against World junior champion, India’s Anshu Anshu. From the first round (round of 16), Adekuoroye humbled Ukraine’s Alina Akobiia 12-0, while she continued her good form in the quarterfinal when she pinned down home girl- Arianna Carier of Italy 10-0 to remain unbeaten. But the semifinal bout against American Allison Mackenzie Ragan was the toughest fight for the Commonwealth Games champion but she wriggled her way to a 10-3 win to become the first athlete to berth in the final of the women’s 57kg. Aminat Adeniyi was not lucky as she crashed in the quarter final losing to America’s Collen Kiyoto in the 62kg. She had earlier beaten Italy’s Sara Da Col 8-4 in the qualification tie and also defeated Elena Esposito 10-0 in the round of 16 before losing to the American in the quarters. However, Blessing Oburududu claimed a bronze medal in the 68kg despite losing 3-1 in the first round to finalist – American Tamyra Mariama Mensah. After her American opponent made it to the final, Oburududu was called up for the repechage tie where she defeated France’s Koumba Selene Fanta Larroque 6-2. Today in the 50kg, Mercy Genesis will be aiming to emulate Adekuoroye as she battles other title contenders.
