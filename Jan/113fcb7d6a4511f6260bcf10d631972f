The doctor with the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) in Yola, Adamawa State, who was kidnapped at the weekend, has regained freedom. The victim, Dr. Abdurrahman Muhammad Kawuyo, who was abducted from his home at Lakare in Yola South Local Government, returned home on Monday morning after his abductors had received N1.45 million ransom. A source said that negotiators had been busy since Sunday morning beating down the ransom from the N10 million initially demanded by the kidnappers. “The sum of N1,450,000 was finally raised and paid,” the source said. The source, who is privy to a recorded conversation, said it was loaded with threats by the kidnappers. “The talks hovered around N5 million for a long time before it came down finally to the N1.45 million.” The Nigeria Medical Association (NMA) said yesterday that it was happy that Dr. Kawuyo had been freed, “but his freedom does not end the story.” The Chairman, Dr. Tounde Elijah, said: “It is not enough to relax. We have to think of how to protect who will be next. “We’re aggrieved. The rate of kidnapping is so alarming. We must tell the government that our hard earned sweat isn’t for kidnappers or any criminal.” Police spokesman Sulaiman Nguroje told our correspondent on Monday that he was yet to have details of how the doctor regained his freedom.
