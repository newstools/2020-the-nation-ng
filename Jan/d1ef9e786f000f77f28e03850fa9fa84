 The Northern Youths Assembly (NYA) has advised the Zamfara Government to shelve its proposed N7 billion Government House project in the best interest of the people. This is contained in a statement signed by Mannir Haidara the state’s NYA Chairman in yesterday. The Secretary to the State Government, Alhaji Bala Bello had last week, announced plans for the project in the 2020 budget. But Haidara noted that the project had no value for the state. “I think that Zamfara does not need a new Government House because, all our past governors did not stay there. “Even the current governor resides in his private residence, so the government should leave the project for the future. “l recall during the campaign of Governor Bello Matawalle that he promised various intervention programmes for the people of the state. “As we are all aware, our state is currently bedeviled with serious security challenges, let us therefore propose projects that will have direct bearing on the people, especially victims of security challenges in the state, “he said.
