There was momentary tension in Amaraku Umuakaram in Isiala Mbano local government of area of Imo State on Saturday when soldiers and operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and Department of State Security Service (DSS) stormed the polling booth of the House of Representatives candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Obinna Onwubuariri, during the rerun election for Okigwe North seat. It was gathered that their action was prompted by an allegation that vote buying might be going on there. But the team left after a few minutes after confirming that there was nothing of the sort. The PDP accused the security personnel of intimidation. Onwubuariri claimed that thugs were imported to chase voters away in Osuachara ward in Isiala Mbano. He also alleged that the card reader was not used in many of the units during the election. But Jerry Onye of the APC debunked the claim of Onwubuariri, insisting that the election was free and fair. Onwubuariri of the PDP and Miriam Onuoha of the APC are main contestants for the Okigwe north federal constituency seat. Some of the booths visited showed that few voters turned out for the exercise. At Umuna Community Secondary, of the 500 voters that registered, only 95 voters complied with the voting exercise as at 1.30 pm.
