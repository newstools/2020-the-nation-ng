The recently held 80th birthday party of Aare Rasak Okoya will be remembered for its panache and the quality of people it paraded. National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, wasn’t left out of the celebration. An exciting part of the night was when Asiwaju stood up to dance to King Wasiu Ayinde’s music. One particular lyric, which made Tinubu to dance like never before was “Tinubu wo ero leyin e, Tinubu Iwolamo, Olofo lobinu Ologo.” Evangelist Ebenezer Obey and King Sunday Ade also excited guests with live performances at the grand party.
