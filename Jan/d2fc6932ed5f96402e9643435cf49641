Nigerian heavyweight prospect Efe Ajagba will return to the ring on March 7 to face a yet-to-be opponent in the co-feature of the card headlined by Adam Kownacki versus Robert Helenius, according to ESPN. Ajagba (12-0, 10 KO) is a 25-year-old former Olympian now training in Texas with Ronnie Shields. He is one of the better heavyweight prospects in the game right now, a 6’6” guy who usually weighs in at about fit 240, 85-inch reach and power to spare. Ajagba fought four times in 2019, where the world saw raw power mixed with athletism. After crushing wins over Amir Mansour and Michael Wallisch in March and April of last year, Ajagba went a 10-round distance with Ali Eren Demirezen in July, then got into a war with determined veteran Iago Kiladze in his last fight on December 21. He dropped Kiladze twice and stopped him standing in round five of that fight, but Kiladze caught Ajagba and put him down in the third, too. The March 7 show will also feature a heavyweight opener, as Cuban prospect Frank Sanchez (14-0, 11 KO) faces scrappy Joey Dawejko (20-7-4, 11 KO) in another 10-round bout.
