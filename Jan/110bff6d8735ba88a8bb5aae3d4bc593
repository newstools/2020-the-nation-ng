Super Eagles forward Samuel Kalu is confident the team will progress to the second round of the 2022 World Cup qualifiers after Nigeria was draw against Cape Verde, Central African Republic and Liberia  on Tuesday. The Bordeaux of France forward, who spoke to AOIFootball.com shortly after the draws , stated that the lads are very much aware of the task ahead as they remain committed to doing the country proud irrespective of the opponents. “I believe in our team; the boys are amazing. We have confidence in ourselves and also believe that we can qualify irrespective of the opponent because we are not scared of any team. We will be ready when the qualifiers begin,” Kalu said. Similarly,  Leicester City’s Wilfred Ndidi  has equally called on his teammates not to be too relaxed with the fair posting, saying  that the team must take every game seriously to ensure they reach the final round of the World Cup qualifiers. “This is the World Cup, no room for complacency. Every game must be taken seriously. Our first game is going to be the most important as well as all our home games, and even away games. We must make it to the third  round,” Ndidi said.
