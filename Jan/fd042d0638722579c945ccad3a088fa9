By Osagie Otabor, Benin  Two persons have been killed in a clash between farmers and herdsmen in Sobe, Owan West local government area. Tension has been heightened in Sobe community over possible reprisal attack from the herdsmen. It was gathered that trouble started on Sunday when an 11-year old boy was found slaughtered inside the bush. The boy was said to have gone to the bush to pick firewood when he was killed by suspected herdsmen. Witnesses said the boy’s relatives from the Kwale extraction mobilised and went after the herders killing one of them in the process. Chairman of the locality, Mr. Frank Ilaboya, who reacted to killings appealed for calm in the community. Ilaboya said he has informed the Commissioner of Police, CP Lawal Jimeta, about the killings and also requested for reinforcement if the need arises. He said: “There is need for everybody to remain peaceful and calm in the community. I have personally spoken to the Odibiado of Sobe, His Royal Highness, Anthony Ero Aleburu, on the need to mobilize his people to ensure there is no more casualty. ” I have also spoken and mobilized the security apparatus in the local government to ensure they are on the standby to forestall further crisis. ” Thank God the security agencies quickly moved in, and in conjunction with the Odibiado and the people of Sobe, calm was restored “This is why I am appealing to all for calm, that people should be refrained from further violence, as violence will not do the community or anybody good”.
