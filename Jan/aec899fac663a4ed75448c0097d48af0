Four bandits terrorising motorists and commuters along the Lokoja-Gegu-Abaji Road met their Waterloo on Monday, as security agents killed them. The bandits were killed during an exchange of gunshots with men of the Nigeria Police Force and local vigilantes. Four others were arrested, while four AK-47 rifles and rounds of ammunition were recovered from them. They are believed to be among those engaging in kidnapping and robbery on the Lokoja-Abaji-Abuja Highway. Kogi State Governor Yahaya Bello has hailed the efforts of security operatives in combating crimes on the highways in the state. He praised members of vigilance groups for their gallantry in foiling the daring antics of criminals on the Lokoja-Gegu-Abaji Road. Bello described the action of the security agents as brave and sacrificial. The governor, who addressed reporters on Tuesdayin Lokoja, said he was aware of the positive impact of community policing. He said that his administration embarked on the recruitment and training of 6,000 vigilantes in 2017 for community policing, noting that such initiative had yielded results.
