Nigeria’s unemployment rate, which stood at 23.1 percent in 2018, will not continue drop, a consultant to the World Bank, Prof. Abel Ogunwale, has said. According to a report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), as at the third quarter of 2018, unemployment rate stood at 23.1 percent; underemployment rate was 20.1 percent, and the combined unemployment and underemployment rate was 43.3 percent. In a chat with The Nation, Ogunwale said a lot of measures needed to be taken across the economy to add a stronger-than-expected net jobs, with all the gains coming in full-time work and largely driven by agriculture, mining, manufacturing and the services sector. His words: “The Federal and state governments need to assist organised private sector in the areas of power and infrastructural development so as to reduce cost of operation and cost of production to increase their employment generation capacities in Nigeria. ‘’We need to diversify our economy to areas, such as  agriculture, mining,  manufacturing , ICT and science and technology development to open up opportunities for employment generation in different sectors of  economy. ‘’The Federal Government’s efforts need to be commended in this area but there is further room for improvement. There should be empowerment schemes across  different sectors of the economy to encourage self-employment and employment generation in Nigeria.”
