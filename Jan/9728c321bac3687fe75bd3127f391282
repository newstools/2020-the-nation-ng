ALEX Iwobi will be returning to action tomorrow against Watford in Everton’s Premier League. According to Everton manager, Carlo Ancelotti will be able to call on the attacking trio of Richarlison, Iwobi and Gylfi Sigurdsson. The Blues’ visit to Vicarage Road will halt an 11-day gap between fixtures – Everton drew 2-2 with Newcastle United last week – and manager Ancelotti has used the fallow period to focus on the urgency of his side’s offensive play. For the first time since his appointment last month, Ancelotti has been able to work with a full complement of players, save for midfielder Jean-Philippe Gbamin, and this week reintroduced the “fantastic” Andre Gomes for elements of training sessions. Everton have claimed 15 points from their past nine league matches and under Ancelotti – who declared he already counts himself as an Evertonian – have won three and drawn two of six top-flight games. Brazilian Richarlison has sat out the past two fixtures, against West Ham United and Newcastle United, but is fit again following a knee injury. A groin issue forced Sigurdsson to the sidelines for the same period but the Icelander is in contention to feature this weekend, along with forward Iwobi, who hurt a hamstring against former club Arsenal last month.
