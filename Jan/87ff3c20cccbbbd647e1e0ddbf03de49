A Chief Magistrates’ Court in Kaduna on Wednesday ordered that a 34-year-old businessman, Yakubu Aminu, who allegedly kidnapped a five-year-old boy, be remanded at a correctional facility pending legal advice. Magistrate Umar Ibrahim did not take Aminu’s plea on the grounds that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter. He ordered the police to forward the case file to the Director of Public Prosecutions for advice. The matter was adjourned till February 12. The police charged Aminu, who lives at Shanono Rigasa, Kaduna State with criminal conspiracy and kidnapping, contrary to sections 59 and 258 of the Kaduna State Penal Code Law. Prosecuting Inspector Chidi Leo told the court that the complainant, Kabiru Mohammed, who lives at Rigasa, Kaduna reported the matter at the police station on January 11. Leo alleged that on January 10, at about 4pm, the defendant abducted the complainant’s five-year-old son, who was sent by his mother to buy soup ingredients in the neighbourhood. The prosecutor said on January 11, the complainant received a phone call by a person demanding ransom of N500,000 before his son could be released. He said that the complainant negotiated with the “unknown caller” and paid N150,000, but his son was not released. The prosecutor added that during police investigation, the number used in calling the complainant was traced to the defendant and he was nabbed, while his accomplices ran away.
