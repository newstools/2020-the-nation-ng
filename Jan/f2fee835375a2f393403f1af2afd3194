The Federal Government has sacked 30 beneficiaries of its N-Power programme in Adamawa State. Mary Yuwadi, Focal Person of the federal government’s Social Investment Programs ( SIP), who made this known to the News Agency of Nigeria ( NAN) on Wednesday in Yola noted that the 30 teachers, were dismissed for absconding from duties at their places of primary assignment. ”Under the Federal Government National Social Investment Programme, a total of 14,100 Youths in the state were registered in various segments of the programmes. ” The federal government has also stopped their monthly payment. This will serve as deterrent for other members who are not serious in their places of work. ”We discovered that some of those who registered under the programme in Adamawa, reside in Abuja and Lagos and collect the stipend being paid. ”We also found out that some of those who registered, were civil servants working in various local government areas across the state,” she said.
