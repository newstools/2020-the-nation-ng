Hip-hop, rap and trap singer and rapper Egwuonwu Chukwuka popularly known as Multi Lord has recalled his bumpy road to fame. The co-owner of record label, Sound Gang, said:  “The journey has been great and exciting. Getting to do what I love and seeing people love me for it means everything to me. “When I first graduated from the University my dad particularly didn’t want music as a career for me, but now we talk sometimes and it is exciting to hear him tell me about my songs that he loves. “Things like that not only gives me joy but tells me the journey is gradually projecting to where I dreamt it would be.” He mentioned promotion as the biggest challenge in the industry: “I will say promotion is one, fraudulent promotion schemes are rampant today, preying especially on upcoming artists. “It’s hard to get what you pay for as far as music promotion is concerned sometimes and  another challenge is getting to work with mainstream artists, if you’re not popular and under big label you might never get the chance. “I understand the business aspect of the music thing but I feel sometimes mainstream artists should make their platforms available for upcoming artists to showcase their talents. It shouldn’t be as difficult as it is now.” But Multi Lord, who started music in 2015 has a lot to cheer about as fortune and fame have eventually found him. He has worked with renowned musical artists and producers like DJ Coublon, KirkoDrilz, Hitman etc. He has written, produced and co-produced hit songs like Dolla $ign, $150K , Never Race etc. He also released a total of 3 singles off his  forthcoming EP in 2919 and an official music video for one of the singles titled ‘$150K’ that has racked up 30,000 views in about one month.
