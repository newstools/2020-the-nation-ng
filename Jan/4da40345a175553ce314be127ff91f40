Our Reporter  The Rivers State Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Felix Obuah  has  advised the opposition All Progressives Congress (APC) to respect the rule of law by obeying court orders. Obuah in statement said obedience to court orders remains intrinsic in democracy, stating that any political party that is averse to this fundamental tenet of democracy does not worth existing.  The chairman  who was reacting to the APC’s statement accusing the PDP of being behind court orders stopping itd congresses, advised the party to put its house in order and stop ‘groping for external enemies’. Obuah said the biggest problem with the APC is ‘a penchant for disrespecting the rule of law and disobeying court orders’, stressing that the earlier the party turns a new leaf, the better for the APC.
