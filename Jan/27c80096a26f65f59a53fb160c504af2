 Plateau United head coach, Abdu Maikaba has described the death of former goalkeeper, Ismaila Shagari as a sad loss to the Nigerian league. Maikaba worked with Shagari closely while he was with Akwa United and the gaffer only has kind words for the ex-FC Taraba, Kwara United goaltender who died on Monday night at the Federal Teaching Hospital, Gombe after a protracted illness. The coach said Shagari was an easy going, humble and without doubt a disciplined goalkeeper who died at the prime of his career. “I only have kind words for Shagari because he was my goalkeeper at Akwa United and he was very exemplary,” Maikaba said. “He was very humble to a fault and was very easy going. He had record of any rough life. It was with a rude shock that I got the news of his death. I was devastated with the information because he still had some years to offer to football.” Maikaba however dismissed the speculation that Shagari died of kidney related ailment but confirmed that the ex-goalie died of hepatitis which affected his liver.
