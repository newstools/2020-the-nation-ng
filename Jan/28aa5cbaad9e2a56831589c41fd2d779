By Okwy lroegbu-Chikezie A Corporate Governance Strategist and former Chairman Board of Standard Chartered Bank of Nigeria, Sir Oluremi Omotosho, has identified leadership as the greatest obstacle to the nation’s quest for development. Omotosho, who was the Guest lecturer, made the submission at the 15th Edition of the Annual Adekunle Kukoyi Memorial Lecture organised by the Nigerian Institution of Surveyors (NIS) Lagos State Branch. He spoke on “Nigeria: Hills and valleys to cross to sustainable greatness”. According to him, a great nation must be one that respects the rule of law, its senior citizens, provide security, basic physical infrastructure in all areas without any form of discrimination. It must also provide access to qualitative education and one that ensures improvement of the quality of lives of the people among others, he added. Omotoso said God endowed Nigeria with great resources but the rate and level of corruption, nepotism, lack of commitment to qualitative education by political leaders had continued to stunt the growth of the country. He called on political leaders to imbibe the positive virtues of late Adekunle Kukoyi and be dedicated in their contributions to the growth and development of the nation, saying the quality of leadership would determine the quality of life of the people. Chairman, Lagos State Branch of the institution, Adesina Adeleke, said the fifteenth memorial lecture was another great opportunity to gain deep understanding on why Nigeria had not yet attained the much -desired greatness and responsibilities. President Nigerian Institution of Surveyors, Alabo Charles, said if Nigeria must grow and experience the desired change it had to go back to the status quo in civic education in order to recover its lost ethos.
