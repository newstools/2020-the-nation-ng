 No fewer than 18 persons suspected to be fake toll collectors have been arraigned before the Anambra State Revenue Mobile Court. The suspects were apprehended by a combined team of law enforcement agents operating under the State Ministry of Transport Anti Touting Squad on routine enforcement. The suspects were nabbed at various locations in Onitsha and environs with bundles of fake tickets, narcotics and currencies. The recovered items were brought before the Revenue Court sitting at Terminal Central Motor Park, near Upper Iweka, Onitsha. They were later granted bail in the sum of N50, 000 each on provision of sureties who must present two passport photographs and any evidence of identification approved by the Federal Government.
