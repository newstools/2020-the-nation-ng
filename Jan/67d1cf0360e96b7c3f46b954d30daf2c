 Gunmen suspected to be assasins on Wednesday killed a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), in Oyo state, Alhaji Babatunde Oreitan. Oreitan, who is one of the leaders of the party in Ona Ara local government, was said to have been killed in the afternoon. Sources said the APC chieftain was murdered in his house located at Oremeji Agugu area of Ibadan. Though details of his death are scanty , it was gathered that the APC chieftain was murdered after Dhur prayer in a mosque located in his house. Efforts to get the reaction of the Public Relations Officer of the state Police Command, Mr. Olugbenga Fadeyi proved abortive. Calls put through his telephone line were not successful. But Deputy National Youth leader of the party, Afeez Mobolaji Repete, confirmed the killing in a post. Repete, who is a former Special Adviser to former Governor Abiola Ajimobi on Youths and Students Matters, described the deceased as a devout Muslim. He said: “The leader of APC in Ona Ara LG, Alhaji Babatunde Oreitan is murdered. “Alhaji Babatunde Oreitan, you were a principled politician, a devoted muslim and a political leader. “Those that killed you will never have peace. Rest in peace Baba Gbemisola, Baba Lateef”.
