 NIGERIA has the potential to secure better trade deals with the United Kingdom (UK) after the exit of Britain from the European Union (EU). Senior Research Analyst, FXTM, Lukman Otunuga, who spoke against the background of the just concluded UK-Africa Investment Summit in London, said Nigeria has potential to win more international partnership for the development of critical infrastructure and businesses. He noted that the UK-Africa Investment Summit was a major milestone in international relations and paved the way to fresh partnerships across Africa. According to him, while during the 11-month transition period, most of the UKâ€™s efforts will be on the European Union and other major trading partners, a UK outside of the EU may have less negotiating power which gives Nigeria and other African nations a chance to secure mutually beneficially deals.
