 Chief Executive Officer, CEO Sujimoto Group, Sijibomi Ogundele was among budding entrepreneurs who received awards from the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi. The award which was presented by the Ooni, United Arab Emirate Ambassador to Nigeria, Dr. Fahad Al-Taffaq; and the Minister for Youth and Sports, Mr. Sunday Dare; was also presented to Funke Adesiyan, Eyitope Kola Oyeneyin, Seyi Awolowo and others. Receiving the award during the Royal African Young Leadership Forum, held in the prestigious Oduduwa hall of the great Obafemi Awolowo University, the Sujimoto boss said it was a great honor to have received this call to duty and recognition from the Ooni of Ife. “This award of excellence is a continuous reminder that he who works hard will stand before Kings because I strongly believe that there is no nobility in poverty and it doesn’t matter whether you are from Ikorodu or Ikoyi, immediately you substitute recklessness for diligence, your true potential becomes a reality.” Speaking about his award, Mr. Ogundele whose family house is about 10 km from the palace said “This, to me, is not just an award. This is a symbol of responsibility to uphold the Omoluabi spirit, the spirit of integrity, the spirit of perseverance, and the spirit of nobility.” “As I sat in a room filled with more than 1000 students and over 99 awardees from fashion, entertainment, technology, manufacturing, business, and other industries, I realized that the Nigerian youth have not even utilised up to 10% of their potential, our true asset is not in crude oil but in the potential of young vibrant people of our nation.”
