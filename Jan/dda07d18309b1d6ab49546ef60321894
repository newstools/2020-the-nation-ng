Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu has directed the Governing Council of Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria and the Selection Board to proceed with the processes required for the appointment of a new Vice Chancellor for the institution. There had been reports of unease in the university over the appointment of a new VC. Interview for the job is expected to begin on Monday (today) but there were reports that the Selection Board had refused to release the guidelines for the exercise. The university, it was reported, has a template for the selection and appointment of a vice chancellor which was used in 2010 and 2015. It was reported that a new template was been developed for the 2020 exercise to favour a candidate believed to be backed by some members of the selection board. But in a statement by the Deputy Director (Information), Bem Goong on Sunday in Abuja, the minister said the selection process should proceed as scheduled in accordance with approved guidelines. The statement reads: “In an earlier correspondence to the ministry, which was copied to the Chancellor of the university, the Obi of Onitsha, HRH Igwe Alfred Achebe, the out-going Vice Chancellor of Ahmadu Bello University, Prof. Ibrahim Garba, requested the ministry’s directive on how to proceed with the matter, which he subsequently put on hold. “In a swift reaction, the minister said, having established that the processes and procedures adopted in the on-going selection exercise are consistent with the approved guidelines and the University Act, proceedings should be continued to a logical conclusion. “It is therefore, the expectation of the ministry that the Governing Council under the leadership of the Chairman, shall take all necessary steps to ensure a successful discharged of this mandate in a prompt, accountable and transparent manner without undue rancour.”
