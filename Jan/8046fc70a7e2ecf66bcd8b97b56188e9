Our Reporter  THREE years after their separation, Nollywood actress Mercy Aigbe has opened up on old wounds, using it as a message to people going through similar situation. Sharing the picture of her assaulted face by her ex-hubby Lanre Gentry which she said, she found while going through her photo gallery, the mother of two noted that one should not be ashamed of their scars, saying it means one is stronger. “Stumbled on this pix in my photo gallery and it brought back memories,” she captioned the picture. “I want to reach out to someone out there! You think your life has been decimated by scars. You find it hard to forgive yourself and others that have been part of the messes in your life! I have good news for you! Your messes will soon become a message! Your errors are gradually turning you into a hero! Your trials will soon become triumph!  “Your adversity is turning to your advancement! Your frustration will soon become your fuel and your scars will one day turn you into a star… at some point in our lives we experience trials, tribulations, we become broken (which is inevitable)…. but whether we will become stronger is not inevitable, It’s our choice…”Never be ashamed of your scars, it simply means you were stronger than whatever tried to hurt you.” It will be recalled that in 2017, the actress who was once married to hotelier, Lanre Gentry, was the talk of town after sharing photos of her allegedly being assaulted by her husband.
