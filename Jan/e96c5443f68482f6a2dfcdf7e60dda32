The Nigeria team defeated DR Congo 25-21 in their last warm up game to build confidence as they hope to banish the memory of their last place finish at the last edition of the championship in Gabon.

He noted that results from the four friendly games played so far suggested that the team would do well at the event. “I am happy with what we have been able to achieve since the training tour began. The first and second matches were a bit difficult but they have beaten two national teams (Cameroun and Cong DR) and are able combine the physical and tactical aspects which produced an exciting result against Congo yesterday,” he said.
