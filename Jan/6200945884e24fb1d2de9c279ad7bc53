Some commuters in Lagos on Wednesday expressed dissatisfaction over the proposed increase of fares by the Primero Transport Services Limited, operator of the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) in the state. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the BRT operator on Tuesday revealed its intention for an upward review of transport fares across all routes in the state to meet up with current realities. The Managing Director of the firm, Fola Tinubu, had told NAN that the current fares were grossly inadequate if the firm was to provide better services for the people. According to him, cost of operating the buses have increased so much that the firm was finding it difficult to survive and sustain operations. In their reactions, commuters, however, told NAN in separate interviews that it was the height of insensitivity on the part of government to think of profit making from poor masses. They criticised the decision to increase fares, saying that it will affect so many people who because of their pockets always wait for long time on queue to use the buses. Bose Ogbonne, an online marketer, said: “It does not make sense at all. People use BRT because it is cheap. We wait for long, queuing up for buses to arrive also. “So, if there is no significant difference between the BRT and commercial buses’ fare, we will not wait for them again. “If we are in a hurry, instead of waiting for BRT and even preferring standing, which will not happen again. They (BRT operators) should think well before doing so.” Ogbonne, who spoke to NAN at Costain in BRT bus stop, urged the state government to intervene quickly so as not to increase the hardship of the poor masses resident in Lagos. Another commuter, who simply identified herself as Mummy Sadiq said that it was not fair to increase electricity tariff, transport fares and others just because workers’ salaries were increased.
