The Nigeria Army has alerted motorists and travellers of five official check-points along Damaturu/Maidugri highway. This action follows the worsening insecurity that has bedevilled the highway, which is the only entry route left into Maiduguri, Borno State capital. According to the notice, motorists and travellers are warned not to stop at any check-point except the ones mounted at “Benisheikh, Jakana, Auno, Mainok and Njimtilo”. The Theatre Commander Operation Lafiya Dole, Maj. Gen. OG Adeniyi, who briefed journalists in Maiduguri, also disclosed that all the officially designated check-point along Maiduguri/Damaturu road are located within the towns and not in the wastelands. Adeniyi explained that his troops have taken far-reaching   measures to address the deteriorating security on the highway to safe guard travellers. Commuters should not stop at any checkpoints except those at officially designated locations”, the theatre commander said. “All the checkpoints are located in towns. Travellers should be wary of any checkpoint in wasteland and empty bushes,” the theatre commander advised. The Nation reports the Maiduguri/Damaturu highway is almost under the control of Boko Haram as the insurgents have lunched continued attacks on the road since the ending of last year, 2019 with many abducted, slaughtered and killed during such operations.
