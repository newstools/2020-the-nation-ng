 A GROUP under the aegis of the Coalition for Affordable and Regular Electricity (CARE) has condemned the planned hike in electricity tariff by the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC). In a statement obtained by our correspondent at the weekend, the group said it was scandalous that electricity consumers across the country have continued to bear the brunt of exorbitant consumption charges with little or nothing to show for it. The statement signed on behalf of the body by Chinedu Bosah and Shoyombo Monsuru, both National Coordinator and National Secretary respectively, urged electricity consumers, labour and pro-labour organisations to resist the planned tariff hike. It may be recalled that the NERC had announced in the December 2019 Minor Review of Multi Year Tariff Order (MYTO) that effective from April 1, 2020, new charges would apply. In the statement which reads in part, CARE stated that “This hike demonstrates the insensitivity and anti-poor character of Buhari government considering the rising cost of living and the growing rate of poverty,” adding, “We have always maintained that the power sector privatisation is a ruse and only meant to make a few privileged people super richer, and that is what is playing out graphically.” Pressed further, the group insisted that “The justification for the hike in electricity tariff by NERC is hinged on these three parameters: average monthly inflationary rate of 11.3% for the period January October 2019; CBN official exchange rates of Naira to Dollar of N306.90 plus 1% cost of transaction amounting to N309.97; the price of natural gas and its transportation for the power sector put at $3.3 but that some generation companies had contracted a different gas price higher than the regulated price; the US actual average monthly inflation rate of 1.8% for the period January to October 2019.” The group further observed that “The 2015 tariff hike that took effect in February 2016 was embedded in the cost of providing and maintaining prepaid meters but the distribution companies refused to provide meters to all electricity companies and have gotten the NERC to come out with a policy that forces consumers to pay exorbitant prices of N38,000 (one phase meter) and N70,000 (three phase meter) having created a new set of exploiters known as meter provider companies hereby unfairly transferred the burden of paying for meter (means of measuring electricity consumption) from the distribution companies to the overburdened consumers.” Upbeat, the Coalition said, “NERC termed the new tariff hike as “Minor Review” when in actual fact the increment is between 40% and 90% depending on the division of consumption and is planning another onslaught (tariff hike) at the end of N2021. Most of the distribution companies, R2TP (a class of residential consumers) have higher percentage increment than the commercial and industrial class consumers, which is an indication that poorer consumers are the worst hit. For instance the R2T residential consumers for Eko Distribution Company will pay a percentage increment of 90%, R2TP consumers of Ikeja Electric will pay a percentage increment of 76% while R3 consumers of Ibadan Distribution Company will pay a percentage increment of 78%” “In the absence of massive or required public investment into the power sector, it is illusory for the self-serving ruling class and government to expect the profit-first private sector to guarantee adequate power or make the already overburdened consumers pay for the growth of the power sector in form of higher tariff.”
