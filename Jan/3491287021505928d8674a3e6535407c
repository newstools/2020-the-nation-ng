An investment fund set up by the German government recently acquired 39.25 per cent in Royal Exchange General Insurance Company (REGIC) Limited,  a subsidiary of Royal Exchange. The investment fund- InsuResilience Investment Fund (IIF) was set up on behalf of German government by KfW and managed by Swiss-based Impact Investment Manager BlueOrchard Finance Limited. The proceeds of the acquisition would help REGIC to spur growth by increasing its risk capital and supporting its underwriting capacity in agriculture, thus extending its outreach to low income farmers. Based in Luxembourg, IIF was set up by KfW, the German Development Bank, on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). The overall objective of IIF is to contribute to adaptation to climate change by improving access to and the use of insurance in developing countries.
