TOTTENHAM manager Jose Mourinho felt it was “unfair” his side only came away from Vicarage Road with a draw after they were held by resurgent Watford, who missed a penalty. Troy Deeney saw his spot-kick saved, but the Hornets extended their unbeaten run in the Premier League to seven matches. Paulo Gazzaniga dived low to his right to deny the Watford captain following Jan Vertonghen’s handball in the second half. But Mourinho told BT Sport afterwards: “I think we deserved to win this match. To lose would have been too harsh on the boys.” Watford goalkeeper Ben Foster saved from Nathaniel Chalobah and Lucas Moura before half-time to thwart Spurs, who have now gone four league games without a win.
