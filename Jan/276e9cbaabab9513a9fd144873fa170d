An 11-year-old pupil on Friday opened fire at an elementary school in Northern Mexico, killed one person, injuring six and then apparently killed himself, prosecutors in the state of Coahuila said. Gov Miguel Riquelme of Coahuila, said at a news conference that the person killed was a teacher, while the attacker committed suicide. “The injured include at least five students and a teacher. Two of them were reported to be in a critical condition. “The attack occurred at a private school in the city of Torreon after the commencement of classes in the morning,” he said. Prosecutor Maurilio Ochoa said on television that the boy asked for permission to go out to change his pants. He took a long time, the teacher goes to him to address him and he got angry. “The attacker had two guns, including a high calibre one. “The boy, whose parents had separated, living with his grandmother, is an outstanding student and not known to have suffered from bullying. “He appeared to have been influenced by violent video games. It was not known how he had acquired firearms,” Ochoa said. School shootings are common in Mexico. In Jan. 2017, a 15-year-old boy opened fire at a school in Monterrey, killing a teacher and himself.
