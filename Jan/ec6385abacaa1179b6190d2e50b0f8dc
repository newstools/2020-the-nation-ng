The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) registered N13.23 billion trading surplus in October 2019. This represented an increase of 54 per cent against the N8.59 billion surplus posted in September 2019. The Corporation’s Acting Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division, Samson Makoji, said the figures were gleaned from the October 2019 edition of the NNPC Monthly Financial and Operations Report (MFOR), which he said reflected the sustained streak of positive results in the operations of the state oil corporation. To underline the increasing fortunes of the corporation in recent times, the September 2019 trading surplus of N8.59billion in turn indicated a significant increase of 65 per cent, compared to the N5.20billion surplus posted in August 2019, even as that beat the N4.26 billion surplus posted in July 2019, reflecting an increase of 22 per cent. The NNPC said the increase of 54 per cent trading surplus in October 2019 accounts of the corporation was majorly attributable to improved trading surplus posted by its flagship upstream subsidiary, the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC). The 51st edition of the MFOR stated a total crude oil and gas export sales of $483.25 million in October 2019, which is an increase of 35.77 percentage point compared to the previous month. This implied that in the month under review, crude oil export sales contributed $396.94million (82.14 per cent) of the dollar transactions, compared with $267.97million contribution in the September, 2019, even as the export gas sales for the month amounted to $86.32 million.
