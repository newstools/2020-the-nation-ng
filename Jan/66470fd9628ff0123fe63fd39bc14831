The Edo State government has not recruited teachers in 10 years, it was learnt on Monday. Commissioner for Education Jimoh Ijegbai, who addressed reporters, said: “In the last 10 years, the state has not recruited teachers for its schools. It did not start with this administration; we have taken the statistics of the gap and I know we will fill the gap in 2020. “Our reform will not be complete without having teachers in critical areas. We know there is dearth of teachers but we will recruit soon.” Ijegbai reiterated that the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led administration was doing everything possible to change the narrative. According to him, the governor had not only initiated and implemented the best education policy – ‘EdoBest’, but had done a lot to revamp vocational and technical education in the state. He said ‘EdoBest’ was dedicated to laying a solid foundation for children up to primary school, while vocational and technical schools would provide jobs for young school leavers. The commissioner said 250 public schools had either been built or rebuilt in the last one year. He added that the government was making efforts in two crucial areas – agriculture and Internally Generated Revenue (IGR).
