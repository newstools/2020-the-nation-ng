The Kano State Command of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has said it has arrested over 906 suspects. It added that it impounded about 8,031,207kg of hard drugs in 2019. The state Commander of the NDLEA, Ibrahim Abdul, spoke on Tuesday during the annual news briefing held at his office. He said that the command arrested 906 suspects and seized 8,031,207kg of hard drugs. Abdul said in the year under review, the command arrested two suspects with 2.927kg of cocaine, adding that it was the first time hard drug of that magnitude was intercepted in the state. The commander said that the command also recorded the destruction of two cannabis sativa plantations at Wailari village in Kumbotso and Kiru local governments. Abdul said that the command, in the year under review, arrested a syndicate of barons dealing in psychotropic substances, adding that eight cartons of codeine syrup weighing 53.6kg were seized and two suspects apprehended. Among those arrested, according to the commander, are the six suspects connected with Zainab Aliyu’s saga, saying: “The command played a significant role in unearthing and arresting the suspects and the woman was saved from execution in Saudi Arabia for allegedly importing tramadol.” “Among the 906 suspects arrested, 103 are women, while 803 are men,” he said. Items seized in the year under review are 4,525.47kg of cannabis sativa, 2,927.669kg of psychotropic, 3.455kg of cocaine, 250.0000kg of khat and 000.167kg of heroine. Abdul said the statistics represented a sharp decline in the number of arrest and seizure, which might not be unconnected with the sustained interdiction operation and drug demand reduction activities. “One hundred and seven convictions were secured, including one female and 76 cases are pending. “The logistics and financial support given by the state government from the traditional institution have played a vital role in complementing our efforts in addressing the menace of drug abuse and trafficking,” he said. Oyo State Command of the NDLEA said yesterday that 201 suspects were arrested for drug-related offences in 2019. The agency’s spokesperson in Ibadan, Mrs. Mutiat Okuwobi, who disclosed this in a statement, said that 71 convictions were recorded during the year.
