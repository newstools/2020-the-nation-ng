International Air Transport Association (IATA) has commended Air Peace for upholding high standards of safety in its flight operations. Its Head of Account Management, West and Central Africa, Dr Samson Fatokun made this known in Lagos Tuesday while presenting the Third IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) Certificate to the Chairman of Air Peace, Mr Allen Onyema. Fatokun congratulated the Air Peace team on achieving the feat. He declared that many airlines had started the safety audit but were unable to complete it. He said: “It gives me joy to present this certificate because I know it’s the fruit of painstaking effort of your team”, adding that scaling through this third safety audit process is a testament to Air Peace’s commitment to maintaining high safety standards in its operations. Fatokun, noting that safety is IATA’s number one priority, asserted that for any airline to pass the safety audit, its safety compliance must be hundred percent, and Air Peace has met this prerequisite. “Many airlines are not able to achieve this because they don’t have the discipline and hard work which have consistently earned Air Peace this safety recognition. The certificate gives the airline a global recognition as a hundred percent safety-compliant airline”, Fatokun averred. In his remarks, Onyema affirmed that the IOSA certificate is something to be proud of, adding that Air Peace is becoming the emerging force in Africa’s aviation landscape. He expressed gratitude to the IATA team and commended the entire Air Peace team for a successful safety audit. He also assured that the airline would always align with global best practices and safety standards.
