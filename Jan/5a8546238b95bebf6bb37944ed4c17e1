He urged genuine business men to continue being law-abiding and run their businesses with utmost compliance with the law as a way to build trust and integrity in their dealings. Saidu expressed appreciation to the Comptroller–General of Customs, Col. Hameed Ibrahim Ali (rtd.), and his management for their consistent encouragement and support, reassuring continued resilience and diligence of officers and men of the Command in carrying out all statutory responsibilities without compromise. Saidu said: “2019 has come and gone. I want to commend you all for your effort in revenue collection, trade facilitation and anti-smuggling. We can do better than we did last year by staying more vigilant against smuggling, duty evasion, concealment, under declaration and other unlawful acts. “Those involved in trade related malpractices will be looking for ways to beat the system, but we have deployed our trainings to productivity through diligent profiling, uncompromising examination, improved trade facilitation, strategised intelligence and tact exhibition for 2020 and beyond.” Breakdown of seizures made in 2019:
