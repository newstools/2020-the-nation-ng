Ogun State Head of Service Mrs. Amope Chokor has praised Governor Dapo Abiodun for regularising the appointment of Permanent Secretaries, and the decision to absorb candidates of the Administrative Staff College of Nigeria (ASCON), employed by the last past administration, into the Civil Service. A statement by her Press Officer, Passover Adeshina, said the gesture shows that the governor was passionate about the people’s welfare. The statement reads: “I am elated that the employment of those officers will be regularised. I am sure the workforce of Ogun State is happy, as we can see the standing ovation the governor received from the workers. The shout of joy inside the auditorium said it all. “Thank God for giving him a large heart to reconsider the report of the committee, as well as that of the House of Assembly. I believe that, as he has brought joy into the Civil Service, his tenure will be filled with joy and I know officials will be committed to ensuring effective service delivery, to take the state to the next level.”
