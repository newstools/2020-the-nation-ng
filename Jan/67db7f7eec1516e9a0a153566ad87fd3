By Tokunbo Ogunsami  Chairman, Board of Governors, JEXTOBAN Secondary School, Pastor Emmanuel Adedayo Ojo, has described the introduction of Trade as a subject into the curriculum of secondary schools as a development that will  enhance employment opportunities for pupils after graduation. Ojo, who spoke at the 25th Anniversary celebration of the school, held at its multipurpose hall at Ibafo, Ogun State, said none of the policies of the government has had any negative impact on the school; hence its various achievements since it was founded. “Private schools are partners in progress because the government cannot do it alone. The moment we abide by the rules and regulations as laid down by the authorities, we are bound to witness peace, and progress,” Ojo said. He gave glory to God and thanked his wife who stood by him through trying times. ”Indeed, Jesus Christ is our banner; that is the meaning of the name of the school. He has been with us. He gave the vision, I didn’t understand. Eventually, I understood He wanted us to start a school and to Him be all the glory for the success we have achieved,” he added  He used the opportunity of  the event to present the pioneer pupil of the school, Mr. Ayodeji Oluwarotimi Awe, to guests. Medical Director, Light Hospital, Lagos Dr Dare Akinade, who preached at the event, admonished youths to use their age rightfully. He urged them to trust in the Lord and not lean on their own understanding so as to enjoy God’s peace and rejoice at the end of their lives. Akinade also urged people to do the right thing and listen to God when He speaks, citing Ojo’s example as a testimony for obedience. The pioneer Head Teacher of JEXTOBAN Secondary School, Ibafo, Aigbefor Victor, commended the giant strides recorded by the Ogun State arm of the school within five years of operation. She said besides the academic training they got at the school, pupils were also trained in sound, moral and spiritual upbringing.
