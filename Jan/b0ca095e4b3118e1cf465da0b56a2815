Ned Nwoko Foundation has pledged its commitment to the fight against malaria in the country. The foundation is seeking more collaboration with Nigerians to eradicate malaria from the country and the rest of Africa. Founder of the Foundation and businessman, Ned Nwoko noted that malaria remained a major problem in Nigeria and the rest of Africa. He said this while receiving the Chief of Defence Staff, General Gabriel Olonisakin, who was represented by the Chief of Defence Civil/Military Corporation, Rear Admiral Obed Ngalabak at the weekend in Abuja, the nation’s capital. Nwoko said: “The fight against malaria means a lot to me. We are looking at eradicating malaria in Africa starting with Nigeria. “There are 54 countries in Africa, six of them are already malaria-free and we are trying to do what they did. The first one will be fumigating Nigeria; it involves everyone because every home and the environment have to be fumigated. Malaria is not a white man’s problem, it is Africa’s problem. We will collaborate with you in what you are doing; you will collaborate with us in what we are doing so that we can achieve some common goals. Everything that we are doing is for public service and the public good. “Civilians and the military must come together to make that happen. We thought to do this simultaneously across Nigeria, dedicate one week for everybody to do this. You guys are fighting many things but let’s fight malaria together.” In his remarks, Olonisakin hailed Nwoko for his efforts in combating malaria. He said: “We are aware of the immense work you are doing to combat malaria, not just in Nigeria but across Africa. “We know that malaria is a number one killer, it kills much more than AIDS and other sicknesses that we are aware of. I have lost a sister personally, I know how it feels and it is a devastating disease.”
