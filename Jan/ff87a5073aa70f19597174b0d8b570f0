By Adeyinka Aderibigbe and Faith Yahaya-Momoh  The Minister of Transportation Rotimi Amaechi on Friday led the Chairman of China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) Zhao Dimlong and the Managing Director CCECC Nig Ltd Jiangxiai Gao on an assessment Tour of extent of work on the Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge. It was the second time in one week, that Amaechi will inspect the project, having toured the entire 157 long kilometre on Monday with his colleague in cabinet, the Minister of state for Transportation Gbemisola Saraki and Oyo Governor Engr Seyi
Makinde among other leading Nigerians. It was the first time since the project began in 2017, that Zhao Dimlong and Jiangxiai Gao will inspect the project with the Minister. Amaechi may have brought the two top chieftain of the Chinese corporation to see the pace of work and had taken them to Apapa, when on Monday, he had expressed displeasure at the extremely slow pace of work. He was piqued that the project Managers on Monday had said the delivery date of the project, earlier slated for April may no longer be feasible. While welcoming the duo at the spot of the ongoing Lagos Station at Ebute Meta, Amaechi had said he brought them to see the pace of the project and to make a decision. He said the project’s deadline officially is April and wondered what happens if the corporation is unable to deliver as at the April. He wondered why China which claims to be constructing over a thousand kilometre of rail tracks yearly would be building 157 kilometres in three years. On Amaechi’s entourage on the trip are the NRC Board Chairman Alhassan Musa and the Corporation’s Managing Director Engr Fidet Okhiria and members of the consultant, Team Consultants.
