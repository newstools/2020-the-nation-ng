Super Eagles midfielder Joe Aribo has travelled to Dubai with his Glasgow Rangers teammates  as the club step up their preparations for the second half of the season. Glasgow Rangers will play a friendly against Uzbekistan champions Lokomotiv Tashkent on Saturday as part of their Dubai training camp. Aribo has 17 league appearances for Rangers, scoring two goals and six assists. The 23 year-old was impressive when Rangers beat rivals Celtic 2-1 at the Celtic Park in their last league game before the international break. Aribo has being tipped to become Nigeria’s best player in a generation, having impressed during his appearances for the Super Eagles since making his debut earlier this season. Born in England, Aribo has been capped four times by Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr, scoring two goals in his first two games for Nigeria.
