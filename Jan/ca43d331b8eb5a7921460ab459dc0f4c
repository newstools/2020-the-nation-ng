 Getafe have completed the loan signing of Nigerian international Oghenekaro Etebo from Stoke City, it has been confirmed. Etebo has joined Los Azulones on a loan deal until the end of the current campaign, while the Madrid-based club will also have an option to sign him permanently. Getafe boss Jose Bordalas had requested to club president Angel Torres to land a central midfielder after Markel Bergara announced to the club his desire to retire due to the multitude of injuries he has suffered. Twenty four year-old Etebo previously has played in La Liga – representing Las Palmas 14 times in the second half of the 2017/18 campaign, although he was unable to prevent their relegation at the time. The midfielder had been on loan in the Canary Islands from Portuguese side Feirense, before subsequently joining Stoke in the summer of 2018 for €7.2m following representing Nigeria at the World Cup. However, Etebo started just eight league games this campaign and Stoke – struggling in England’s second tier – needed to reduce their wage bill. Etebo was a prominent player under Nathan Jones but fell out of favour when Michael O’Neill took charge in November. He recovered from injury but there was a hint that he had not done enough in training to warrant selection. He had not played for Stoke since limping out of a defeat at Sheffield Wednesday in October and he is now understood to be waiting for a visa to complete his move to Spain. Overall, he has played 51 matches for Stoke City since he transferred to the club in the summer of 2018, and has scored two goals. His first goal came in March in a 2-0 win over Nottingham Forest and he added a second in a 1-0 win at Blackburn Rovers.
