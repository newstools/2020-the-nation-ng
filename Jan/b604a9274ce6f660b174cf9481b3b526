Our Reporter  Petroleum Training Institute (PTI), Effurun,  Delta State has resumed academic activities after four weeks of closure due to a strike  by its senior staff members. The resumption date was made known through a memo signed by Mr A. Irefo on behalf of  the Registrar. According to the statement, students were expected to resume last Friday, while academic activities were to take off on Monday. Earlier, the institute’s workers under the eagis of Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN) had embarked on a strike, which lasted two weeks, a development which made PTI to suspend academic activities.  But the PTI’s Deputy Director, Public Affairs Brown Ukafimoni denied that the institution was shut. He said the students were only asked to proceed on a four-week Christmas break. It was gathered from an undisclosed source that the workers complained of not receiving their entitlements promptly, lack of implementation of staff promotion as well as the poor state of some of the institute’s facilities.
