 Despite FA Cup hostilities in the United Kingdom, the English Premier League (EPL) has celebrated Nigeria midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi, who joined Leicester City three years ago. EPL on his twitter handle posted the video clips of the Super Eagles player to mark the day he signed for Leicester City when he moved from the Belgian club, Genk to England. The Premier League stated that Ndidi has been very impressive since he joined the EPL side three years ago. Ndidi made his Belgian Pro League debut with Genk on 31 January 2015 against Charleroi in a 1â€“0 away defeat. He played the first 74 minutes of the game, before being substituted for Jarne Vrijsen. During the Belgian League play-off game against Club Brugge, Ndidi scored a long-range goal, which was named the goal of the season in the Belgian league. After receiving an attempted-clearance outside the penalty box, he lofted the ball smoothly over an opposing player before unleashing a ferocious volley into the top right corner. The ball was adjudged to be travelling at over 111 km/h.
