Super Eagles and Udinese defender Williams Troost-Ekong is thrilled with his club’s 1-0 away win against Leece in Monday night’s Serie A clash. Troost-Ekong played for 90 minutes as The Friulians claimed their sixth win of Serie A campaign at the Stadio Comunale Via del Mare. The two sides couldn’t break the deadlock until Rolando Mandragora threaded a pass for Argentine attacker, Rodrigo De Paul, who powered home a fine strike two minutes from regulation time for Udinese’s winner. Troost-Ekong, who was handed his 16th league appearance on the night, took to social media moments after the match to express his excitement. The performance on the night saw Udinese move to the 13th spot on Serie A log with 21 points from 18 games. Troost-Ekong will look forward to replicate the same form when the Luca Gotti’s men play host to Sassuolo in their next Serie A fixture on Sunday, January 12.
