 THE trial of Yakubu Jekada, one of the accused persons charged with the misappropriation of N35 million belonging to the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB), was stalled at a Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court, Maitama, due to the defendant lawyer’s ill health. Jekada was first arraigned on May 31, 2018, by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) before Justice Peter Affen of the High Court of the FCT, sitting in Maitama, Abuja.  He was arraigned on a four-count charge bordering on criminal breach of trust and dishonest use of JAMB funds to the tune of N11.189 million. The JAMB official was accused of committing criminal breach of trust while he was JAMB’s State Coordinator for Plateau State between 2009 and 2016, when he was entrusted with 11,189 units of e-facility cards belonging to the board. He allegedly disposed the cards without duly rendering accounts to the board. On the resumed sitting on the matter yesterday, Prosecution lawyer Ekene Iheanacho informed the court that the matter was for continuation of trial and that he was with his two witnesses.  But Jekada’s lawyer Gyang Zi prayed for an adjournment.  After listening to the lawyers, Justice Peter Affen adjourned the matter till March 3, 2020, for continuation of trial.
