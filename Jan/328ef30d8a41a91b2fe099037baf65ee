Lagos State government on Tuesday said there was no law stopping police officers from prosecuting suspected offenders in Magistrates’ Courts. Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr. Moyosore Onigbanjo (SAN), said the Administration of Criminal Justice Act (ACJA), which bars police prosecution of criminal matters in Magistrates’ Courts does not apply to Lagos. Onigbanjo stated this in a statement by the ministry’s Deputy Director, Public Affairs, Mr Kayode Oyekanmi. The commissioner said Lagos State was aware of stakeholders’ efforts to stop the practice of police prosecution in the interest of justice. The attorney-general said he had set up a seven-man committee to examine the pros and cons of the proposal. He said: “The Ministry of Justice is aware of the current clamour by the non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and other stakeholders to stop police prosecution of criminal matters in Magistrates’ Courts, in accordance with ACJA provisions. “The ministry wishes to clearly state that the ACJA does not apply to Lagos State. Furthermore, there is no provision of any law barring the police from prosecution of criminal matters in Magistrates’ Courts in Lagos State. “As such, the provision of the law in Lagos State, as it stands, does not bar the police from the prosecution of matters in Magistrates’ Courts. “However, the Ministry of Justice is always willing to investigate any issue that would improve the administration of justice in the state.” Onigbanjo said the committee’s report would be examined and used to advise the government accordingly. He added: “More importantly, the ministry is currently in the process of reviewing the state laws relating to the Administration of Criminal Justice. “The ministry hereby assures members of the public that they would be informed on the outcome of the committee’s report.
