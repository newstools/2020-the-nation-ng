 Electricity workers have threatened to go on strike if the Federal Government fails to implement the December 11, 2019 agreement it reached with them. They gave the government 14 days to do the needful or face an industrial action. Seven weeks ago, the Federal Government reached an agreement with workers in the electricity sector, who are claiming that the government had reneged in its promise. They have threated to resume the suspended strike. The workers, under the aegis of National Union of Electricity Employees (NUEE), threatened to ground power supply nationwide, if government fails to implement last year’s agreement with them. The union’s grievances include unpaid benefits to over 2,000 disengaged workers of the defunct Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) since 2013; underpayment of over 50,000 ex-PHCN staff; payment of half salaries to workers by the power distribution companies (DisCos), among other perceived unfair labour practices. Addressing reporters yesterday in Lagos at the NUEE headquarters in Yaba, NUEE General Secretary Joe Ajaero accused the Minister of State for Power, Goddy Agba, of harassment and intimidation during the union’s negotiation on challenges affecting workers in the sector. The union leader said if issues were not addressed at the end of the ultimatum, the country should hold the minister responsible for the result of such action.
