These isolated incidents minimally affected the peaceful and orderly exercise in only four of the Twenty-Eight constituencies where elections were conducted. “However. consistent with the Commission’s resolve to sanction electoral bad behaviour. the Commission took the following steps to protect the process: “In Akwa-lbom State. where the officials of the Commission were abducted and diverted to an undesignated location and forced to compromise the elections in Essien Udim Local Government Area. all the polling units involved were identified and their results discountenanced. “In Isa Local Government Area of Sokoto state, the activities of bandits prevented the Commission from deploying to a few polling units but the Commission successfully conducted elections and declared results. “In Abi State Constituency of Cross River State. officials of the Commission were abducted and thus prevented from deploying in eight polling units. “All officials of the Commission that were abducted have been rescued and accounted for. In furtherance of its resolve NOT to accept results from areas where the processes were disrupted and its officials attacked. the Commission took a firm action by not accepting results from such areas as it could not vouch for their their integrity. The Commission notes that in most cases, these incidents were not widespread and did not significantly affect the overall results. As such declarations and returns were made”. It continued that, “in the case of Oru East/Orsu/Orlu Federal Constituency of lmo State. the election was conducted peacefully in the eighteen (18) polling units as ordered by the Court.

They injured our staff and other persons at the Centre, destroyed result sheets and damaged the Commission’s Local Government building being used for the collation. Consequently, the Commission suspended the process. “Arising from the suspension of collation, the Commission has decided to apply the provision of Paragraph 47(f) of its Regulations and Guidelines for the conduct of the elections which provides that in the event of such a disruption. saved original and duplicate result sheets be used to complete the collation of results. “Accordingly. the Commission has deployed a high-powered team consisting of National Commissioners.
