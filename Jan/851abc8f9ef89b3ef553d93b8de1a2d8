Nigeria Football FederationÂ  (NFF) has made clear their intent to see the Super Eagles play some of the best nations in the world after revelations that they have reached advanced talks over a proposed friendly against the Die Mannschaft, AOIFootball.com reports. The Football Association of Germany has however given the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) conditions that will see the proposed friendly game against the Super Eagles go ahead next year. Nigeria plans to play a test game against the 2014 World Cup winners next year during one of the international breaks as part of the newly formed tradition of the NFF to only engage top teams in friendly games. Already, they have started the process by playing against Ukraine in October, a game that ended in a 2-2 draw and it was followed by another high profile friendly game against Brazil which ended in a 1-1 draw. Germany is interested in the game but have told Nigeria that the game will be played in Germany and not Nigeria. They also want Nigeria to confirm the availability of all their top players as another condition. Furthermore, the game will see Germany earn a large share of the proceeds from the game as they are presently highly ranked than Nigeria by FIFA. All these conditions were verbally communicated to the NFF when contact was made. Aside from Germany, talks are expected to take place with Belgium and Italy as well, with Nigeria keen on getting games that will put the Super Eagles in top shape for their upcoming 2021 Africa Cup of Nations Qualifiers next year and also the 2022 World Cup qualifiers.
