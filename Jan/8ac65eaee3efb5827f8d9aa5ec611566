By John Austin Unachukwu  ATTORNEY–General and Minister of Justice of the Federation, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN)  has directed Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to transmit to the National Depository all executed agreements, Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) and treaties in their custody. Malami said the list covered those to be entered in the future in their original form. They should all be transmitted to the first ever National e- Depository of Treaties domiciled at the Federal Ministry of Justice, the AGF said. He explained that the National Depository of Treaties will serve as the depository of all treaties entered into between the government of the Federation and any other country, the  MDAs. This was in line with Section 4 of the Treaties (Making Procedure, etc.) Act Cap. T20 Laws of the Federation (LFN) 2004, he added. The AGF reiterated the need for all MDAs to transmit the treaties, all executed agreements and MoUs, in their original form.  He said: “It is our hope that very soon the National Depository of Treaties will be in the cloud for a more global outlook and accessibility from any part of the world. “It is about transparency, accessibility and order in line with the tenements of Open Government Partnership and access to justice which the government of President Muhammadu Buhari is committed to upholding”. He said the project is geared towards achieving functional National Depository of Treaties, maintain a comprehensive/updated Register of Treaties as well as ensure that all Treaties, Agreement and Protocols entered into by the Government are preserved. Earlier in his welcome remarks, the Solicitor- General of the Federation and Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Justice, Dayo Apata (SAN), said the electronic depository of treaties is one of the ways the Federal Ministry of Justice is utilising and  taking advantage of technology to make accessibility to the depository easier and faster for Nigerians.
