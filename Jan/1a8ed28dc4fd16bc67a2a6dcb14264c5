By Taofik Salako Capital Market Editor  As part of its Employee Give-Back initiative, employees of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) have donated funds to support the initiatives of the Women at Risk International Foundation (WARIF) in Lagos. This is one of the various employee engagement initiatives instituted to encourage employees to make a positive impact in their communities while providing them with hands-on experience and learning opportunities on issues that plague the society. WARIF is a non-profit organisation founded in 2016 in response to the high incidence of sexual assault, rape and human trafficking occurring among young girls and women across Nigeria.  Presenting the donation to WARIF, Head, Corporate Communications, Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), Mr. Olumide Orojimi said giving back by volunteering time, donating money and other essentials is at the core of the culture at the NSE. According to him, the NSE believes that promoting gender equality and diversity is a critical success factor for global economic prosperity. “At the Exchange, we champion an organisational culture that promotes diversity and inclusion as well as the wellbeing and development of all employees through the implementation of gender friendly policies,” Orojimi said.
