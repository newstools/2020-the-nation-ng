Since Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi, installed Fuji maestro, King Wasiu Ayinde, as Maiyegun of Yorubaland, there has been controversy over the position of Kayode Ajulo, who was given a similar title a year ago by Aare Gani Adams. But the lawyer has reacted saying there was no ground for rivalry between him and the new Maiyegun. He spoke on their different roles, adding that the importance of the two titles was nothing but to ensure peace in Yorubaland. Also, the former National Secretary of Labour Party and members of his legal team were hosted to a dinner by President Mohammadu Buahri at Aso Rock. This was in celebration of Buhariâ€™s victory at the tribunal. The president personally signed a letter, commending Ajulo for his contributions and professionalism.
