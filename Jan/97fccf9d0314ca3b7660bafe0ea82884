A member of House of Representatives representing Michika/Madagali federal constituency, Hon. Zakariah Nyampa has appealed to security agencies in the country to beef up security in Michika to avert another attack on the community by Boko Haram terrorists. Zakariah said in a statement in Abuja on Sunday that soldiers stationed in Michika deserve more logistic support to be able to withstand subsequent attack by the terrorist group. Boko Haram insurgents launched an attack on Michika at the weekend but were repelled successful by the military. The lawmaker particularly called for the deployment of additional soldiers to the area, adding that the whereabout of a cleric, Reverend Father Lawan is still unknown after the attack. He said: “The effort by the Nigeria Army is well commendable but they need more trucks because the Boko Haram Terrorists also destroyed the only truck they had in Michika. “Our people had to run helter skelter when they heard that the terrorists were approaching the town. “We thank God for their lives but the only civilian casualty is the missing pastor whose whereabouts is still unknown. “We want the Government to intensify efforts to get the whereabout of Rev. Lawan, the DCC secretary of Michika. Government should also put provide more trucks to border areas like Michika. ” I am also calling on all our people to support the Nigerian army in this fight against Boko Haram as both the federal government and the states government are making efforts to restore peace in the community. “When the Boko Haram attacked Michika on the 2rd January. The Army quickly swept into action killing most of the terrorists and pursued them towards Lassa river where they lost one of their truck to Nigeria army.”
