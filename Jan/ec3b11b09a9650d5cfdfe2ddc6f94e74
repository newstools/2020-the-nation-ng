Leke Adeboye, the last son and Senior Personal Assistant of the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye has described US President, Donald Trump as an inspiration. Adeboye commended Trump for his actions even as he described him as an inspiration. His comment is coming at the heels of the growing tension building up between the United States of America and Iran. On his Instagram page, Adeboye wrote: “One of the men of the year 2019 was and is still Donald J Trump. As in the guy is just an inspiration. “He is like if you want to be crazy then! Rascality does not have a monopoly. “Welcome to 2020, when others were talking about defending Jesus, someone already cut off an ear, Thank God for the person moved, it would have been the whole head. I did not come to talk.”
