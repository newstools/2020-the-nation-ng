The Lagos State government on Thursday handed over 10 vehicles and 26 motorbikes to the Traffic Enforcement Team assigned to unlock traffic gridlocks across the state. During the handover at the Ministry of Transportation, Ikeja, Commissioner for Transportation, Frederic Oladeinde, said the items were procured to enable the enforcement team carry out their operations. He promised that more equipment would be deployed to enhance efficiency in traffic control around the metropolis. According to him, the combined team of Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA), Lagos State Neighbourhood Corps (LNSC), Lagos State Environmental Sanitation Corps (LAGESC), Nigerian Police Force and OPMESA, was adopted to tackle the hydra-headed challenge of the traffic gridlocks and subsequently provide a holistic solution to the traffic situation. The Commissioner added that traffic management would not stop at enforcement but move into other areas such as reconfiguration and rehabilitation of road infrastructure, including the on-going junction improvement at critical areas to increase capacity for vehicular movement. He hailed Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu for his consistent support and drive towards combating traffic congestion, assuring that work would continue to ensure that the vision for efficient traffic management and transportation system is achieved in record time. Special Adviser to the Governor on Transportation, Oluwatoyin Fayinka, promised that the team will make good use of the equipment. He said officers were carefully selected from all the enforcement agencies to achieve free flow of traffic. Fayinka appealed to officers to be diligent in discharging their duties as monitoring teams have been set to monitor their activities. LASTMA General Manager Olayinde Oduyoye said: “We will do our utmost best in ensuring the free flow of traffic in the State, we won’t return to the dredges of yesterday.”
