THE Nigerian Council of Registered Insurance Brokers (NCRIB) has bemoaned the fire that ravaged Akesan Market (Oja Akesan) in Oyo town, where properties worth millions of naira were destroyed. The council lauded Governor Seyi Makinde for his promise to assist the victims of the incident, as well as the promise to provide firefighting equipment to forestall a repeat of such ugly incidents NCRIB President, Mrs Bola Onigbogi, who stated this, decried the spate of incessant fire disasters in the country, noting that such occurrences were preventable by the government than those often concerned. She used the forum to underscore the pivotal place of insurance in disasters management in the country. According to her, risks are part of the inevitable circumstances of life which  effect could be better managed by engaging insurance as it is practised in advanced countries. However, Onigbogi noted that to maximise the value of insurance, the best option for existing and potential clients was to engage insurance brokers who are in the position to advise clients on best possible type and rate of insurance as well as assist them to make their claims when a loss occurs. She called on the government to embrace insurance for effective prudential management and to assist the citizens by shifting the burden of compensation to insurers when losses occur to them as against the government’s attitude of giving succour to the victims which in most cases may be inadequate.
