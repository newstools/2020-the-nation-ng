By Adekunle Yusuf  Nigerians have been urged to show more support and empathy to children living with cancer. This, according to the founder of the Dorcas Cancer Foundation (DCF), Joseph Adedayo, would help to boost the children’s morale in the fight against the ailment. At an event organised by DCF for children living with cancer, which held at the paediatric oncology ward of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, (LUTH), Idi-Araba recently, Adedayo said Nigerians need to imbibe the culture of supporting the vulnerable in the society, stressing that it is important to celebrate and recognise children living with cancer to revive their recovery hope. “We decided to celebrate these children in the spirit of the season; while their colleagues are at home having fun, these children with cancer are in the hospital having surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, going through things that you cannot even imagine. They need to know that they have not been forgotten, no matter what they are going through. They deserve to have fun and be happy,” Adedayo said.  RMT Productions, Chief Executive Officer, Mrs Kemi Odutola, said there is reason to  support to children living with cancer because it serves an encouragement, which can boost their recovery chances. “It is a privilege for us to support them because it encourages and shows them that we care for their situation. It is not out of pity but out of the fact that we are one; if we are healthy we can also encourage them in whatever situation they find themselves in, whether cancer or other health challenges,” she said. She also urged the children to keep fighting, saying many people had conquered cancer and are  called survivors. Commending the initiative, Obielu Perpetual, a mother of a cancer survivor, Emmanuel, called on Nigerians to show support in  any way they could to children suffering from the disease, as it would help the children and their parents in conquering the disease.
