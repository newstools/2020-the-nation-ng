By Akeem Lawal Super Eagles defender, William Troost-Ekong suffered an apparent knee injury in Udinese’s 2-0 Serie A defeat to Parma last weekend, NationSport reports. The Nigeria international made his 19th league appearance at the Stadio Ennio Tardini and was in action until the 79th minute when he was fouled by Parma’s Matteo Scozzarella. The 26-year-old was then replaced by Sebastien De Maio, a minute later as he could not continue with the encounter.
This is the first time he will be subbed off since May 2019. During the duration on the pitch, the defender won three aerial battles and made just one successful tackle, none of which was able to stop the hosts scoring early with a 19th minute strike through Riccardo Gagliolo before Dejan Kulusevski doubled in the 34th minute. The loss compounded Udinese’s woes as they suffered their third straight defeat across all competitions and second in Serie A after last week’s 3-2 loss to AC Milan. Even though there in no official statement from Udinese concerning the injury, there is fear that the Nigerian may not be fit when the club host Victor Moses’ Inter Milan at the Stadio Friuli on Sunday.
