From Franca Ochigbo, Abuja  The National Park Service (NPS) has arrested 607 suspects for various offences ranging from illegal poaching, logging, grazing and others between January and November last year. Its Conservator-General (CG), Ibrahim Goni, who spoke during a visit by the United Arab Emirate (UAE) Ambassador to Nigeria, Fahad Al-Taffaq, in Abuja, said the NPS, in partnership with the UAE, was reintroducing species that were extinct to the country’s wildlife. He said there was a new  focus on the rehabilitation of the endangered Scimitar-horned oryx, a breed of the antelope family. Also, the two organisations are partnering on zoos and wild life programmes. The continual partnership with the Nigerian Army, Police, and the Airforce will help tackle the security challenges at the nation’s parks. Goni assured that bandits were not harboured inside the Kamuku National Park, stating that they only operate in the surrounding environments. To prevent the worst climate impact, we must change course and step up our ambitions, he said. The C-G said all that was being done was to bring more actors to the table to save Nigeria from the imminent effects of climate change. “When we restore nature, we create healthy eco-systems, which locks away more carbon and helps stabilise our climate,” he said. Speaking, the UAE envoy expressed his desire to partner with NPS to see how some wildlife species can be reintroduced. “As we partner with Nigeria wildlife, we will go into various national parks and reserves to identify species that are extinct and bring them back. “The UAE will support the Nigerian wildlife and its natural preservations to reduce the impact of climate change,” the envoy said.
