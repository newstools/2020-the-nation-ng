 THE Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) and Rungas Prime Industries Limited are partnering to establish a 400,000 per annum Type 3 liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) Composite Cylinder Manufacturing Plant in Polaku, Bayelsa State. The Executive Secretary of NCDMB, Simbi Wabote, confirmed this during a town hall meeting with chiefs and representatives of the Polaku Community in Yenagoa, saying Rungas had been allocated two hectares of land at Polaku for the establishment of the factory. NCDMB had purchased 10.6 hectares of land at Polaku in June 2013 for the purpose to establish a pipemill but discussions with Yulong Pipemill of China and other investors did not yield expected results, leaving the land to lie fallow for almost seven years. He said the groundbreaking ceremony for the  gas cylinders manufacturing facility will be performed in a few weeks by the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, adding that NCDMB is keen for the project to start immediately because it will create employment opportunities for youths from the state and environs. He stated that the facility is the direct linkage to one of the minister’s operational priorities, which is the penetration and utilisation of liquefied petroleum gas or cooking gas by Nigerians, adding that the project will generate up to 200 direct and indirect jobs during construction phase and about 350 direct and indirect jobs during the full operations phase, in addition to other induced employment and economic activities. He also confirmed that NCDMB had allotted another hectare of the Polaku land to a gas distribution company for the construction of a Pressure Reduction and Metering Station. ”This is meant to supply gas to upcoming industries in Polaku, Gbarain, and other surrounding areas.”
