Members of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN), also called the Shi’ites, yesterday cried out about alleged deteriorating health condition of their detained leader, Ibrahim El-Zakzaky. They said he may die in Kaduna correctional facility, if urgent steps are not taken to address his ill health. IMN accused the Federal Government of frustrating efforts to give their leader adequate medical treatment. The group has been calling for unconditional release of El-Zakzaky and his wife, Zeenat, who are currently detained by government in a correctional facility in Kaduna State. It claimed that government did not allow his doctors and family members to see the sheikh in prison, claiming that: “the government wants him dead and they are doing everything possible for him not to get justice”. A member of IMN’s Academic Forum, Abdullahi Musa, told reporters in Abuja that the movement feared for El-Zakzaky’s life. Musa said: “All the efforts to take El-Zakzaky for medical treatment have been frustrated by the government. “He was not allowed to see his doctors and family members and he was denied basic needs, in violation of the court order which directed that he should be given the necessary care while in prison custody.” The group said its members would not be cowed by the “deceptive methods” employed by the Kaduna State government, insisting that El-Zakzaky’s fate was not in the hands of the Kaduna State High Court, as Governor Nasir El-Rufai recently claimed. “El-Zakzaky is being denied medication and we fear for his life. There is no reason to hold him. They want him dead. Whatever happens to our leader, Sheikh El-Zakzaky, we know the real culprits, and they alone will shoulder the consequences,” he said.
