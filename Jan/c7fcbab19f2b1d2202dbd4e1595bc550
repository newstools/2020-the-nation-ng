Nicholas Kalu, Abuja  The Nigeria Police has commenced investigation into a viral video on social media where persons dressed and armed as policemen are extorting from members of the public with a point of sale (POS) machine. In the video shared by @marshallkacy, the “policemen” are seen demanding some citizens by making payments with their ATMs on the POS machines. In the 45-second video, a particular young man can be heard protesting that he would not provide his own ATM, because he had never heard about such.
