Maijidda Abdulmumini on Friday brought her former husband, Abubakar Sulaiman, before a Sharia Court 1 in Magajin Gari, Kaduna State, over alleged N250,000 arrears of maintaining her pregnancy. The plaintiff, Abdulmumini, through her counsel, B.M. Jino, told the court that they were seeking N250,000 for maintaining Sulaiman’s pregnancy for five months after their divorce, up till her delivery.
