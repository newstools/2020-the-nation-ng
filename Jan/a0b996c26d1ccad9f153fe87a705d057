Our Reporter  In a way of declaring New Year resolution, Afrobeat musician Seun Kuti has said he will continue to serve the motherland. He took to Facebook on New Year’s Day to declare his resolution. He wrote: “The only New Years resolution to have if u are a motherland person: This year I will dedicate myself to the freedom of motherland people and the development of motherland communities.” He then ended his statement with the question, “What’s yours?”  Like his father, the late founder of Afrobeat, Fela Kuti, Seun has used his music in service to Nigeria, Africa and the entire black race. While alive, Fela used his music to fight oppression and suppression by the military in Nigeria. Though Fela paid dearly for his opposition, he never relented in fighting the cause of the common man. Seun’s grandparents were also both activists.
