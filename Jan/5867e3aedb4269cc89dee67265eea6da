One hundred days in office of the Lagos State Chairman of the National Union of Road Transport Workers, NURTW, Alhaji Musiliu Akinsanya, has been fruitful and peaceful. A member of the union from “Branch C” Lagos Island, Alhaji Agboola Hakeem Kosoko, aka Okoro, who made the remark in a chat with newsmen in Lagos, said that the union is now more united than before he took over hundred days ago. He stated that Idumota, Olowogbowo and Isale-Eko are now peaceful with residents going about their legitimate duties without any molestation. Alhaji Kosoko prayed that God would continue to give MC Oluomo more wisdom to steer the affairs of the union in Lagos. Speaking in the same vein, a community leader in Idumota, Prince Idowu Onikoyi, said that traders in Idumota are now happy because they now conduct their business without molestation or extortion as witnessed under the former executive of the branch. He explained that before now, traders in Idumota and residents had no peace of minds due to unnecessary crises and the killing of innocent citizens by thugs. Also, Alhaji Isiaka Emmanuel, aka Babanla Apongbon, and Alhaji Fatai Okoosi-Otun said that the recent security meeting attended by members of the union at the Lion Building Police Station revealed that progress was made in the area of peace on Lagos Island in the last few days of the dissolved executive of the Branch C. They enjoined the Caretaker Committee in the branch to maintain the peace and work together with Alhaji Yusuf Aweniya, aka Bobo.
