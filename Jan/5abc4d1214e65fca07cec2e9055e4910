Our Reporter  DStv subscribers are set to enjoy a new drama series, ‘Unmarried’. ‘Unmarried’ tells the story of three inseparable young ladies, as they strive to survive the dynamics of friendship, career challenges, relationships, as well as general issues. Nengimote (Venita Akpofure), Funbi (Enado Odigie), and Kamsiyochukwu (Folu Storms) grew up on the same street in a simple Lagos neighbourhood, although their personal decisions have taken them on very different paths through life. They soon find out that through their contrasting relationship and professional paths, the rope that binds them together is largely built from the fibre of several cultural nuances peculiar to women living in Nigeria.  From the cultural demands of marriage, looking for a child and expectations for a male child, to enduring the pains of infidelity, separation, divorce, family interference in marriage, segregation and women discrimination in the workplace,  weave through the wire to find strength in their uncommon friendship. As the story of bittersweet relationships and segregation unfolds, viewers will quickly realise that the three bubbly friends are not alone, as they are pieces of a puzzle that needs immediate attention to achieve a tolerant society on a grander scale of things. ‘Unmarried’ began to air from Wednesday, January 8, 2020 at 09:00 pm (WAT) on Africa Magic Showcase (Channel 151) on DStv.
