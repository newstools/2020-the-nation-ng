Nigeria’s under-19 cricket coach Uthe Ogbimi has said that playing in the CUBS cricket tournament will help the young cricketers in their preparation for the upcoming 2020 U19 World Cup in South Africa. The Yellow-Greens are currently in South Africa for their maiden U19 Cricket World Cup campaign which begins on January 17 and are featuring in an eight-team CUBS cricket tournament which began on Saturday and will end tomorrow to fine tune preparation for the World Cup. Ogbimi said on Sunday that the team’s preparations were intense and would produce a good outing in the team first-ever World Cup appearance. Nigeria secured a dramatic, first ever spot in the ICC Under-19 World Cup after they beat Sierra Leone by two wickets, on the final day of the Africa qualifying tournament in Namibia in March last year. “We are featuring in an ongoing tournament with some of the best teams in South Africa. The CUBS competition began on Saturday and will end on Wednesday,” Ogbimi said “This is necessary to evaluate how prepared we are for the World Cup.” The Yellow-Greens, who are in Group B with England, Australia and West Indies, left the country for South Africa in December.
