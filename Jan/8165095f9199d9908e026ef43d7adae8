Super Eagles midfielder and Al Adalah new signing John Ogu was impressive in his debut for the club in the quarterfinals of the King’s cup  on Friday at the Al Ansar Club Stadium (Medina) against Al Nassr. The former Hapoel Be’er Sheva of Israel ace was in action for the entire duration of the match, an indication that he is set to enjoy massive playing time under Tunisia born Coach Nacif Beyaoui. Though some analysts had predicted that it would be a smooth sail for Al Nassr who occupy the second position on the league table playing against Al Adalah who are 15th on the log, it didn’t turn out completely to be so as Al Adalah put up some good effort despite having only 28% possession. The first half ended on barren note before Al Nassr found the net in the 51st minute through Morrocan Abderrazak Hamdallah after enjoying a timely assist from Sultan Al Ghanam. While it was action all the way for Ogu however, it was not the same for compatriot Ahmed Musa who saw only five minutes action. He came in as late substitute in the 90th minute with the final whistle taking the centre stage in the 95th minute. The Eagles captain thus had the last laugh as Al Nassr zoomed into the semifinals. In the remaining quarterfinals ties billed for Saturday,Abna will face Al Fateh while Al Wahda take on Al Ahli.
