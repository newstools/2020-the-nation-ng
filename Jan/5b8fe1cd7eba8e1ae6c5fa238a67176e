The Nigeria National team on Friday lost its second game to Gabon 26-24 in the 24th Men’s Senior Africa Nations Cup, in Rades, Tunisia. It was a tight game but the Gabonese edge the Nigerian team in both halves 14-13, 12-11 for a total score of 26-24. Coach Rafiu Salami had hoped that his players would use the game to bounce back to reckoning, however, the players couldn’t get the needed point and have been eliminated from the championship and will now have to play in the classification series. It was a painful loss as the Nigerian players gave their all but missed chances was their bane as they will once again play for pride in the classification games just like they did at the last edition when Nigeria finished last. Nigeria plays Libya in the last group game tomorrow, while Group leader, Angola takes on Gabon. With Angola already through to the quarter final, Libya and Gabon will battle for the other ticket to the quarter final. It will be recalled that Nigeria lost its opening game to Angola 30-24 on Thursday.
