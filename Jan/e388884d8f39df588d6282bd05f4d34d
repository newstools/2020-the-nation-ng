 Super Eagles midfielder Joe Aribo has revealed that he has been under intense pressure to deliver for his Scottish league side Rangers, noting that the fans insist not only in winning every match but with wide margin. Such mind-set according to the former Charlton Athletic ace mounts a lot of pressure on every player that wants to be in the good books of the fans and also maintain regular shirt with the team. He however described the pressure as positive one as it has motivated him to work harder with a view to improving his performance in every match. “One thing I have always said is that the fans here at Rangers are just ruthless, they want to win every game and it has to be by a big margin. I know every week I have to perform, I have to be the best that I can be and we have to do that as a team also,” Aribo admitted. He added: “That pressure makes you a better player and a better person because you know if you’re sloppy or you’re not at your best then you will come out of the team. It is good pressure and it is what you need to be the best that you can be,” he enthused. Aribo who was impressive for Super Eagles in the 2021 AFCON qualifiers said nothing gladdens the heart of every player than winning matches and meeting set targets. “Momentum is a big thing and if you are winning then you just want to keep winning, keep playing and keep the games coming thick and fast so you can keep winning.” The former Staines Town midfielder made a scoring debut with the Super Eagles in an international friendly match against the Andriy Shevchenko-led Ukraine last year.
