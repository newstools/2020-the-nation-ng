Osun State Governor Adegboyega Oyetola has been described as a media savvy leader, who neither looks for trouble nor courts controversy. Information and Civic Orientation Commissioner Mrs. Funke Egbemode, who spoke in Osogbo while receiving the executive of the Lagos Council of the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ), led by the Chairman, Dr. Qasim Akinreti, however, said that behind Governor Oyetola’s gentle attitude to life was an uncommon energy to work long hours without losing his temperament. “You only see him upset when you don’t meet your target,” she added. According to the commissioner, the governor, who is poised to doing things differently, is eager to showcase Osun to the rest of the world with a view to bringing in investments into the state’s mining, agriculture and tourism sectors. “Osun is too rich to be poor and we explore just 30 per cent of our natural resources in the state. We will become a regional commercial hub and the governor is determined to make it happen,” Egbemode said. Akinreti had observed that since Mrs. Egbemode assumed office, she had brought innovation to bear on her job. He said that in the history of the Nigeria Guild of Editors, Egbemode’s performance as the former president was still unbeatable. Secretary to the State Government Prince Wole Oyebamiji praised Egbemode for changing the face of the state in the media since her appointment. Oyebamiji, who also received the Akinreti-led Lagos NUJ executive, pleaded for more media support for Governor Oyetola and his administration, who, according to him, is striving to fulfil his electoral promises to the people.
