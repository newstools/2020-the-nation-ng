 THE General Manager of Shaanxi Heavy Duty Automobile Import and Export Co. Ltd, Mr. Tian Chao, visited its distributor, Transit Support Services Limited (TSS) and other major customers in the country last  week. Shaanxi is the manufacturers of SHACMAN Heavy and Medium Duty Trucks and Road Tractors. This visit was to the expanding market of SHACMAN Heavy and Medium Duty Trucks and Road Tractors in Nigeria through its TSS franchise company. Tian met with the dealers and customers of the SHACMAN brand as well as discussed plans to build a Complete-Knock-Down (CKD) plant in collaboration with TSS. This, TSS said, will contribute to the development of the automobile sector and encourage technology transfer between China and Nigeria. SHACMAN held its grand assembly line opening ceremony at the ANAMMCO assembly plant in January 2015 and has since produced over 1,800 trucks from the factory. This marks a significant breakthrough in the localisation project, since the brand’s entrance into the market through TSS as SHACMAN Nigeria. TSS said over 3000 SHACMAN vehicles have been sold. “Tian’s visit  afforded him an overview of the Nigeria truck market with a view to increasing investment in the country. SHACMAN has since inception manufactured over 1,000,000 vehicles of different varieties. SHACMAN’s military truck has successively participated in the 35th, 50th, and 60th anniversary military review on China National Day. SHACMAN is one of the Chinese heavy-duty truck manufacturers to have advanced in the localisation project since the vehicle assembly policy in Nigeria. SHACMAN Nigeria operates through a network of dealers and showrooms in Lagos, Benin, Owerri and Abuja,” TSS said.
