Rangers International F.C’ new attacker, Ifegwu Ojukwu, who joined from Dakkada F.C of Uyo, has said that he was in the ‘Flying Antelopes’ fold to score goals and help the Enugu side challenge for trophies on all front. Ojukwu who has been firing from all cylinders since helping the Uyo based side gain promotion to the top flight of Nigeria club football said that it was not a difficult decision for him to make with regards to joining the seven-time Nigeria league Champions. “Yes, I am very happy to be in Enugu to give my best to help Rangers challenge for the league trophy at the end of the season. I am here to score goals and I believe that with the cooperation of my team mates, it will be achieved. The quality of players I met here gives me the confidence that we are title challengers,” stated the Abia born but Lagos brought-up attacking sensation. The all action attacking sensation further said, “Joining Rangers from Dakkada F.C was not too a difficult decision for me as it has always been my wish to lace my boots for the Enugu side that has achieved so much in both domestic and continental football. When my manager called to inform me that Rangers have interest in having my services, I jumped for joy as any players’ dream will be to defend the colors of the ‘Flying Antelopes’.” Ojukwu said he is not afraid of making match day squad for Rangers due to the large pool of quality in the attacking department stressing, “I am not one that chickens out of any challenge. From where I am coming from, it has always be challenging but I have full belief that I can impress the coaches at training to have me fielded for matches.” Recall that the management of Rangers recently acquired the services of four players to help the team challenge for honors in the NPFL 2019/2020 season even as the team seam to have turned the tide for the better with three straight victories to swim out of the relegation zone after a long while even with four matches in hand.
