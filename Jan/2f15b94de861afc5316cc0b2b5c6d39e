 Delta State Police Command has confirmed the arrest of purported ‘Pastor’ Kenneth Mukoro, who allegedly killed a woman at Otu-Jeremi. Police Commissioner Mr. Adeyinka Adeleke disclosed this via phone to The Nation. He said: “Yes, he is in police custody.” Our reporter visited the community and met the pastor, an elder and another member of the church, who debunked reports that the suspect is a youth pastor of the popular Pentecostal church. Refusing to disclose their names, they confirmed that he (Mukoro) is a member of the church, but has not been regular for the past two years because of a Law programme he is running at the University of Port Harcourt (UNIPORT) in Rivers State. “He is not a youth pastor. He is not even close to being a leader. He is just a 50-50 member. He is not even serious. His major base is Port Harcourt. He schools in UNIPORT. When he is around, he comes here. “He came to fellowship with us during the festive period. That was when he had a misunderstanding with some members and hit the woman. She fainted and died. He was never a pastor and never held a position in this church,” one of the trio said. Some indigenes, who spoke to The Nation on condition of anonymity, described the suspect as being notorious and a “leader” in the church. They confirmed that he had been away from the community and recently came because of the festivities.
