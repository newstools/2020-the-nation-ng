 Super Eagles’ Wilfred Ndidi will miss the rest of the month with the hard-tackling midfielder set to undergo an operation. Ndidi was the surprise absentee from the Leicester City line-up for their Carabao Cup semi-final first leg and manager Brendan Rodgers has revealed that he picked up a knock in training on Tuesday. While Rodgers says it’s not serious, the Nigerian is expected to be operated and will be side-lined until February. “He took a knock in training yesterday,” Rodgers said. “Unfortunately, he might need to have a slight operation today which will put him out for a few weeks. That’s just unfortunate. “But it’s not overly serious. Hopefully into February, he will be fit and ready to go again.”
