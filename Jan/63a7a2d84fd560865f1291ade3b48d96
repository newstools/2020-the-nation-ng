Our Reporter  A new series on Cartoon Network, Mao Mao: Heroes of Pure Heart, is set to premiere on GOtv on January 27. The series centres around Sheriff Mao Mao, a crime-fighting samurai cat, and how she navigates through adventure, friendship, and depicts what it really means to be a hero. Mao Mao becomes an explosive loner on a quest to become legendary, but later meets Badgerclops, the cyborg slacker, and Adorabat, the adorable sidekick, as they overcome their differences and work together to protect the people of Pure Heart Valley from monsters, villains and everything in between.  In Pure Heart Valley, Sheriff Mao Mao may be impressive, even heroic, but he still has a lot to learn. On his journey, Mao Mao will learn that being a legend is not about showcasing flashy moves and dangerous quests; it is about what you do that makes people remember and admire you. Mao Mao: Heroes of Pure Heart is the brainchild of Parker Simmons and produced by Cartoon Network Studios and Titmouse. The kids can follow and learn from Maoâ€™s quest to become a legend when the programme airs weekly from 27 January at 3:20pm.
