Gunmen have abducted a ward Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), at Akungba-Akoko in Akoko South West Local Government Area of Ondo State, James Tolorunju Ajulo. He was kidnapped on Monday at his home at Ibaka quarters of Akungba-Akoko. Sources said the kidnappers stormed Ajulo’s home shortly after his arrival after an outing. They ransacked the house before taking him away. Ajulo, who was one of the factional ward chairmen of the APC in Akoko South-West Local Government, was driven away in his car after the gunmen had ransacked his house. A political associate of the victim, Tolu Babaleye, who confirmed the incident, narrated how the incident happened, noting that “the kidnappers laid an ambush for him in his house. “They ransacked his house after which they took him away in his own car. They used the Toyota Sienna car they came with as a backup to escape from the scene. “They shot sporadically in the air to scare away residents, which aided their escape from the town.” While stressing that the kidnappers are yet to establish contact with the family, Babaleye, a lawyer and an APC chieftain, said the matter had been reported at the Akungba Police Division. He called on the Department of State Service (DSS), Army, Police and Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps to assist in rescuing him unhurt. Confirming the incident, police spokesman Femi Joseph, a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP), said investigation had begun on the matter, stressing that detectives had been mobilised towards his freedom.
