Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) generated  N1,341,690,568,327.18 in Year 2019, it has been learnt. The revenue is above the target of N969,831,167.83 set for the year and it is N139,241,835,082.29 over the  N1,202,448,733,244.89 generated in 2018. NCS Comptroller-General, Col. Hameed Ibrahim Ali (retd.), who commented on the revenue, described the feat as the result of resolute pursuit of what is right rather than being populist by compromising national interest on the altar of individual or group interests. Customs Public Relations Officer, Mr. Joseph Attah, broke the news in a press statement on Thursday. Attah said Customs revenue generation profile had continued to rise annually as the current reforms in the service insist on: The partial border closure, which has forced cargoes that could have been smuggled through the porous borders to come through the sea and airports, raised revenue collection from ports. Before the commencement of the border drill on August 20, 2019, revenue generation was between N4 billion to N5 billion, but the NCS currently generates between N5 billion to N7 billion daily. The partial border closure is a decisive action against the challenging issue of trans-border crime and criminalities fueled by the noncompliance to ECOWAS Protocol on transit of goods by neigbhouring countries. NCS hopes ongoing discussions with Nigeria’s neighbours will yield permanent solution to border insecurity. The Service wishes to express its readiness to strictly implement the outcome of the ongoing diplomatic engagements. In the same vein the Service efforts to prevent the entry of items that could compromise the Security of our citizens, National Economy and the well-being of our people resulted in the seizures of 30,906 assorted items with a duty paid value of N62,134,426,199.00. These seizures include arms, ammunitions, illicit drugs, used clothings, vegetable oil, frozen poultry and foreign rice among others that have grave consequences on economy security and well-being of Nigerians. Attah said “While we give our assurances of total commitment to the course of nation building, we call on Nigerians, especially the business community to support the NCS on the ongoing drive to robustly contribute to National Security and create enabling environment for businesses to thrive in the country.”
