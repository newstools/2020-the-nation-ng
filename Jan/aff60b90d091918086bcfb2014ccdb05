Our Reporter  Nigerian Lagos Deep Offshore Logistic Base (LADOL) and Mammoet, a firm engineered in heavy lifting and transport, have entered into strategic partnership. The deal is aimed at expanding LADOL’s capacity for project cargo handling and logistics for industrial sectors in West Africa and enables LADOL to utilise Mammoet’s crane fleet and project management services to provide clients with more comprehensive and cost-effective solutions. According to LADOL’s Senior Public Relations Officer, Olakunle Kalejaye, Mammoet will supply LADOL with its heavy lift terminal crane – MTC 15 – which turns any quay into a heavy lift terminal. With a load moment matching a 1,200-tonne crawler crane or a large floating sheerleg, the crane enables loads up to 600 tonnes to be lifted to and from the quay from non-geared cargo vessels. This lifting capacity is ideal for loading and offloading heavy items such as columns, vessels, reels and engines. The crane will be installed at the LADOL quayside before end of this month and will be the biggest installed shore crane of its kind in the region.  In addition to the MTC 15, Mammoet will mobilise a 250-tonne crawler crane to support LADOL’s quayside operations. General Manager of Mammoet West Africa, Harmen Tiddens, said: “We are honoured and excited to partner LADOL because together we can bring greater value to our joint customers. Any company with a project that requires shipping or handling of project cargo in or to or from Nigeria now has a new, fast, reliable and cost-effective option in Lagos.” LADOL’s Executive Director Business Development, Mr. Jide Jadesimi, said: “The establishment of a long-term relationship between Mammoet and LADOL is an extremely exciting and significant development in terms of massively increasing local capacity. It will attract to Nigeria the general fabrication and complex construction jobs that are in increasing demand not just in Nigeria but across the sub-region.”
