Ogun State has begun arrangements to resuscitate the abandoned Olokola sea port project as part of  moves to improve transportation. Deputy Governor Noimot Salako-Oyedele led a delegation to visit the office of the Managing Director of Nigeria Ports Authority (NPA) Ms Hadiza Bala Usman on the Marina, Lagos. She noted that the visit was important to seek advice and ensure synergy between the government and NPA. “The Olokola sea port is fantastic for Nigeria, even our state, and that is why we are keen to attract investors to this project, to let them see how we can resuscitate it vis-a-vis the development further down the coast of Lagos. We will also see how to work through and what scale we can re-introduce the project as to what it was in early 2000 when it was first envisaged.”
