The Edo State Government, in partnership with the Federal Fire Service, has commenced full investigation to unravel the immediate and remote causes of recent fire incidents in the state. The State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, disclosed this after a meeting with the Controller of Fire, Zone K Command in-Charge of Delta, Edo and Bayelsa, Karebo Pere Samson, at the Government House, Benin City. Obaseki said the state government invited men of the Federal Fire Service to facilitate ongoing investigations into the series of fire incidents, as well as strengthen fire response services in the state. He reassured of the readiness of his administration to collaborate with the federal agency in strengthening the laws regulating the Edo State Fire Service. Obaseki said, “The collaboration will also include helping us to adequately train our fire service personnel and make equipment readily available. Already, trucks have been deployed from the Federal Fire Service to help the state deal with fire incidents.” Earlier in his remarks, Samson said the agency was ready to collaborate and assist the Edo State Government in ensuring fire incidents in the state are put under check. “Our fire truck carries 5,000 gallons of water; we have made arrangements with some water tankers that will assist our fire truck and firemen with water when we exhaust the water our truck carries. These tankers will follow us to fire sites. We also need security to protect us so that nobody will stop us from doing our job as we have in the past experienced people stopping firemen from doing their jobs.”
