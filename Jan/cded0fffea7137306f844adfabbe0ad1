The Kwara State Government has said that it has put measures in place to guide against spread of Lassa fever and other communicable diseases in the state. State’s commissioner for health Dr. Raji AbdulRasaq said on a radio programme monitored in Ilorin, the state capital. He added that the ministry had started various enlightenment programmes to educate the public about the symptoms of the disease, channels of transfer and how to prevent its spread. AbdulRazaq also said the state’s quarantine facility is 95 percent completed and would be ready in about one week to strengthen Kwara’s preparation. He added that the state government has procured some medicines for the state’s Specialist Hospital Sobi to tackle the disease, urging members of the public to patronise the facility for early detection. Dr. AbdulRasaq implored residents of the state to prioritise their personal hygiene and good preservation of their food to prevent diseases. The commissioner commended Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq for prioritising people’s health by declaring a free malaria treatment in all government’s hospitals. On the restructuring of primary health care centers across the state, Dr AbdulRasaq urged communities to be patient with the government as the issue will be attended to one after the other.
