We are aware of the issues that we have been having. But as two big brothers, we have been able to sort out issues. “As two big brothers, there’s nothing we cannot sit down and sort out. We are glad all the security issues that took place in South Africa and Nigeria have been sorted out amicably. This is how it should be and we should continue to partner in this direction to ensure that we live peacefully and relate better for the good of the people,” Dingyadi said.
