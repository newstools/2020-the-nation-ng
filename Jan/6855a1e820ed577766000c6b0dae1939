A Nigerian is doing us proud somewhere in the United Kingdom and he’s is none other than Joel Popoola, a former banker with United Bank of Africa (UBA). Born in Nigeria, Popoola has pioneered the first abuse proof digital democracy platform application in the United Kingdom. Having worked under the direct tutelage of Tony Elumelu, Hakeem Bello-Osagie and the Chief of Staff to the President, Mallam Abba Kyari, the UK-based professional software consultant has digitalised the functionality of democracy to suit its real essence. Known as the Rate Your Leader App, it has a five-star rating on the Google market and has been certified as the new level of politics in the new decade. The App simply reconnects electors and the elected, and also uses abuse proof technology to combat online harassment as well as fake news. Popoola, who holds a Master’s degree from the University of Ibadan, told Social Circuit that there were plans to launch the App in Nigeria following its launch and acceptance in the UK. Happily married with kids, the Osun State-born entrepreneur is surprisingly publicity shy. He believes that action should speak louder than words.
