A Federal High Court in Lagos has fixed February 3 for the arraignment of 42-year-old Ganiyu Kiokik, charged with trafficking 4.45kg of cannabis. The defendant was charged by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) on one count. The charge marked FHC/L/10C/2020 is pending before Justice Muslim Hassan. The prosecutor, Mr Jeremiah Aernan, said that the defendant committed the offence on October 22, 2019. He said that the defendant was arrested following a tip-off at Ikaka Agege in Lagos, while trading on hemp, a banned substance. The alleged offence contravenes the provisions of Sections 11(c) of the NDLEA Act, 2004.. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that drug trafficking attracts up to life imprisonment. Also, the NDLEA has arrested 146 suspects and seized 225.32kg of substances suspected to be hard drugs  in Imo State last year. The command disclosed this in a statement issued by its spokesman Mr Sampson Uche in Owerri yesterday. While presenting a review of the command’s performance in 2019, Sampson said the agency counselled 48 Persons Who Use Drugs (PWUDs) and rehabilitated five drug dependent persons. He further said that the Command successfully convicted eight drug peddlers while conducting sensitisation and enlightenment campaigns in locations across the state including secondary schools, churches, communities, motor parks and via radio stations.
