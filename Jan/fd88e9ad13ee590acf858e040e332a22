Lagos State Government has organised a one-day training in occupational and health safety for Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) officials. The Director-General, Lagos State Safety Commission (LSSC), Mr. Lanre Mojola, urged LASTMA officials to operate and do their work in conjunction with the THEMES agenda of the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration. He said that the mandate of the commission was to protect lives, properties and promote safety culture within socio-economic sectors. Mojola said once the safety measure was adhered to by the LASTMA officials saddled with the responsibility of manning roads, less accidents would be recorded on roads. “Let me urge all participants to utilise the opportunity provided by today’s training to impact on millions of Lagosians. This will help to complement the efforts of the government, especially concerning the THEMES agenda of the Governor Sanwo-Olu administration by making efforts to educate and enlighten road users on the rules and regulations, as well as the consequences of violations of the rules,” Mojola said. He urged participants to utilise the knowledge gained from the training by adhering to safety rules and regulations, adding that safety measures must be adhered to at work places and homes. One of the facilitators, Mr. Adeyinka Adebiyi, who delivered a paper on “Occupational Safety and Health in relation to Traffic Management”, said the safety and health of every LASTMA official is paramount to the government and people. He said there would be less accident on the roads if Nigerians were trained, noting that “this will make the nation safe and secure, hence the safety and health training organised by the Lagos State Safety Commission.”
