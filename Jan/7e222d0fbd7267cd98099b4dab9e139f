Tehran’s Police Chief, Hossein Rahimi, on Monday denied that the security forces under police commandment had shot at the protesters over the past few days, state TV reported. Earlier, hundreds of people tried to stage demonstrations in Tehran in protest against the downing of a Ukrainian passenger plane by Iran’s Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) over Tehran’s airspace. Meanwhile, the IRGC had accepted that it mistakenly shot at the plane, blaming it on human error. According to Rahimi, Tehran’s police officers have been ordered to show restraint in the face of protests. (Xinhua/NAN)
