Former African Footballer of the Year, Emmanuel Amuneke will  expectedly be in Egypt today to hold talks with  management of Egyptian  Premier League side Misr El-Makkasa over the vacant coaching role. As exclusively reported by NationSport yesterday,  reliable sources close to the immediate past coach of Tanzania national team informed that the former Nigeria International will finalize deal  with the Fayoum-based team if the terms are favourable. The club sacked former Egyptian  international Ahmed  Mido on Wednesday after a poor run of form saw them winless in 10 games. The team suffered a recent 3-1 defeat to Pyramids FC on Tuesday to drop to 15th place in the league table with 11 points after 14 games played. Amuneke is a famous name  in Egypt where he played for Zamalek before going to Europe to star  for Sporting Lisbon and Barcelona.
