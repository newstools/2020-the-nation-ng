A compliance solutions expert and Managing Director of DataPro Limited, Abimbola Adeseyoju, has said Nigeria can harness data to fight cybercrime. Speaking on Monday ahead of today’s celebration of National Privacy Day, Adeyanju said the day is meant to remind operators and players within the digitalised world about their obligations on data privacy and protection and the need to avoid data breaches, abuses and mis-use. He said the importance of having the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) issued by the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) on January 25, 2019, is that every Nigerian citizen all over the world is guaranteed data privacy. According to him, this is part of their fundamental human rights by which they can ask for justice any time this right is breached, abused or mis-used. Adeyanju said DataPro, as a data protection compliance organisation (DPCO), is meant to, among other deliverables, evaluate the level of compliance with the NDPR by accountable institutions, such as data controllers, data processors and some government agencies. “According to the NDPR provisions, any person, subject to the regulation, found to be in breach of the data privacy rights of Nigerians shall be liable, in addition to any other criminal liability to: (a) In the case of Data Controllers/Data Processors dealing with more than 10,000 Data subjects (such as IT companies, payment companies, FinTechs, banks, insurance companies, etc) payment of the fine of two per cent of annual gross revenue of the preceding year or payment of N10 million, whichever is greater (b) In the case of a Data Controller/Data Processor dealing with less than 10,000 Data subject payments of the fine of 1% of the Annual Gross Revenue of the preceding year or payment of the sum of N2m whichever is greater,” he said.
