The Lagos State Government will shut PWD Level Crossing around Ikeja GRA axis tomorrow and Brewery Level Crossing on Iganmu axis on Saturday between 8 pm and 6 am. This is in line with the Nigerian Railway Modernisation Project (Lagos-Ibadan section) which extends to Lagos Port, Apapa. Alternative routes have been provided for road users to utilise during construction. This, the government said, was to ensure motorists reach their destinations with ease. The closure has also been slated to ensure a smooth and uninterrupted flow of work on the rail tracks. “Motorists plying the Ikeja axis are advised to access their destinations via the Ilupeju Level Crossing and Ikeja along Level Crossing, while commuters driving along the Iganmu axis of Surulere should make use of the Costain and Orile corridors, Bode Thomas Street and Eric Moore Road,” the government said, adding: Lagos State government is hereby appealing to residents especially motorists that ply these corridors to bear the pains, as the project is aimed at achieving a seamless multi-modal transport system. Road users should bear with the government as it takes steps to further create transport infrastructure that will ultimately improve the travel experience of commuters in the state.”
