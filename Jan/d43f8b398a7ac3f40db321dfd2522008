By Franklin Onwubiko  Twenty-FOUR academic staff members of Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, have been granted full professorial chair. Seven of them are females. According to Acting Director of Information of the institution, Mrs. Chika Ene, 24 other persons and another 23 were promoted to the rank of Reader. The university’s image maker stated that the workers were promoted after thorough scrutiny at the 99th meeting of the Appointments and Promotions Committee for academic staff and subsequently approved by the Governing Council. Ene said Faculty of Management Sciences tops the chart with five professors; followed by Social Sciences with four, while Arts, Engineering and Medicine have three professors each.  Faculties of Health Science Technology and Bio-Sciences have two each, while faculties of Basic Medical Sciences have one. Ene attributed the action to the vice-chancellor’s drive towards making the university one of the best 200 instituions in the world. “The Vice-Chancellor Prof. Charles Esimone, has placed huge priority on staff welfare. A good number of staff both teaching and non-teaching have been promoted,’’ he said. Recently, many Junior workers who had upgraded their certificate in the course of time have all been converted to senior staff and all of these are happening within seven months of assuming office as vice-chancellor”.
