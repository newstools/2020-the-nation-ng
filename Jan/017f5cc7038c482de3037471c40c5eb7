 IN its bid to provide affordable and comfortable housing for Nigerians, Efficacy Construction Company Limited, a Lagos-based construction company, has launched James Landing 2, a low-cost housing estate located at the Sagamu interchange, Ogun state. The construction giant, which has been in existence for over a decade and known for its commitment to providing shelter as one of human essential needs, said it has come up with the affordable housing scheme to lessen the housing burden on millions of Nigerians who are yet to become landlords. Speaking during the launch of James Landing 2, Oyeleke Ajiboye, Group Managing Director, Efficacy Construction Company Ltd, said the company was committed to helping many Nigerians actualize the yearning for comfortable living at an affordable price. â€œAt Efficacy, we have committed ourselves to providing quality and cost-effective housing solutions. Our desire is for more Nigerians to become house owners without breaking the bank and that is why we have launched James Landing. James Landing is a low-cost housing estate designed to be a gated community providing maximum security to prospective residents. Our goal is to make sure that by the end of 2020 more Nigerians would have had a place to call their home and lessen the commotion of tenancy issues in the country.
