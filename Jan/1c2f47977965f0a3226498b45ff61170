Our Reporter The Rivers State Economic Advancement Summit Project Director, Mr. Kennedy Odubu, has assured the selection process in the nominations of the Rivers State Legacy Awards will be free and fair. Odubu spoke in Port Harcourt, the state capital at the inauguration of the panel of juries headed by Dr. John Opobo. He said that nomination into the 2020 Rivers State Legacy Awards has begun with very great turn up by members of the board, adding that the calibre of persons/organisations nominated this year is overwhelming. Urging members of the public to take advantage of the process by nominating deserving individuals and organisations for this prestigious award, he reiterated the commitment of Emerging Nigeria, the official facilitators of the award, in ensuring a free and fair selection process. The 2020 Rivers State Legacy Awards will this year be hosted alongside the 2020 Rivers State Economic Advancement Summit which is expected to attract an estimated 1,000 investment stakeholders from within and outside Nigeria. The Rivers State Legacy Awards is founded to honour some deserving individuals and organisations who over the years have written their names in the sands of time in Rivers State and contributed in no small measure to the development of the state. Opobo said the selection process for recipients for the award will be based on merit and nominees subjected to a voting process by members of the public.
