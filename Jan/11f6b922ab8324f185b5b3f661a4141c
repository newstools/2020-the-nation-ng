 A non-governmental organisation, The Kemi Remi-Dairo Foundation in partnership with the Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency(LASEPA), has intensified efforts to curb noise pollution which leads to hearing impairment. Founder of the Foundation, Mrs Kemi Remi-Dairo, at a sensitization campaign tagged: ‘Walk for hearing 2020’, which was held in Lagos, noted that people exposed to abnormal noise levels risk suffering hearing loss. She disclosed that the campaign was aimed at creating awareness on noise pollution, it resultant effects and how to curb it. According to her: “We want to create an awareness on noise pollution and loss of hearing. Based on this kind of environment we live in, there is noise pollution everywhere and people experience it daily, it then leads to hearing loss.” While urging people to report pollutants around them, she said she was once a victim of noise pollution, which later affected her hearing ability. “When people suffer hearing loss, it is always expensive to get the condition rectified. The solution is to get an implant and it is very expensive. The only way to avoid hearing loss is to stay away from noise pollution.  And we are also working with the Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency to ensure that we have a noiseless Lagos.” She called on the government and private individuals to come to the aid of those who have suffered hearing loss by providing hearing aids, or if possible do surgeries for them.
