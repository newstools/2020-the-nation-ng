The Lagos State Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC),  Hyginus Omeje,  has said the Corps would intensify more on road safety advocacy involving transport stakeholders, to stem the high level of crashes. He said the Corps would work in collaboration with transport stakeholders and other security agencies in enforcing traffic rules, adding that it would embark on rigorous public enlightenment campaigns to eliminate crashes. The sector commander said it was quite unfortunate that crashes increased last year despite efforts of FRSC to reduce them, noting that the command recorded 557 crashes with 119 people killed last year, compared to 355 with 103 killed in 2018. He said the increment was caused by falling of tankers and trailers with much spillage of products, adding that most of the crashes were fatal as a result of fire outbreak due to the spillage of content whenever a crash occurred. Omeje said it was imperative to involve transport stakeholders, especially the fleet owners and operators in the public enlightenment campaigns and as stringent enforcement that would enable the Corps achieve its target of 20 per cent reduction of crashes and 25 per cent  fatalities.
