The Lagos State Environmental Sanitation Corps (LAGESC) has said it has arrested 36 persons for crossing the highways. Corps Marshal Mrs. Gbemisola Akinpelu, a retired commissioner ofa police, in a statement signed by Mr. Adebayo Kehinde, head of Public Affairs Unit, said besides the suspects risking their lives and those of motorists, they also impeded free flow of vehicular movement while crossing major highways where overhead bridges were erected for usage. “The agency is geared toward attaining total compliance on road crossing and use of pedestrian bridges, in line with the mandate of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on the enforcement and prosecution of the offenders. “The distance from the pedestrian bridges where arrests can be made by LAGESC officers against erring pedestrians wishing to endanger their lives by crossing the highway is pegged at 200 metres. “The agency is carrying out total enforcement in some of the identified areas such as Ikeja Along, Ikorodu Road, Ojota, Berger, C.M.S., among others,” she said. Akinpelu said that the agency had established additional divisional offices toward ensuring coverage of all areas. She stressed the need for divisional commanders, deputy divisional commanders, unit commanders and senior officers to monitor pedestrian bridges. The retired CP urged the officers and men to dislodge traders around the bridges and walkways for free human movements.
