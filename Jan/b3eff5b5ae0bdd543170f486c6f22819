 Kobe Bryant was killed on Sunday in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California. The 41-year-old former Los Angeles Lakers basketball star’s death was confirmed by TMZ. The outlet reported that Bryant was traveling with four other people in his private helicopter when it crashed, killing everyone on board. Officials with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department responded to reports of the crash near Las Virgenes Rd and Willow Glen St in Calabasas at around 10am after a fire broke out. The cause of the crash is under investigation. It is unclear where the chopper departed from or where it was headed when it went down. The 18-time NBA All-Star spent his entire 20-year career with the Lakers, winning five NBA championships before he retired in 2016. He was the first guard in NBA history to play at least 20 seasons. Bryant has been known to use a Sikorsky S-76 helicopter to travel for years – often flying from Newport Beach to the Staples Center for Lakers games.
