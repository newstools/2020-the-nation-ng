 The Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps (TRACE), Traffic Department of the Sango Police Command and Ado-Odo Environmental and Health Department have pledged to go tough on residents, especially the traders displaying goods on the highways and illegal dropping of refuse on the roads. The agencies said there wouldÂ  be zero tolerance on the issue of obstructing highways with goods and illegal dumping of refuse, urging market leaders to liberate their members and other residents to desist from this to avoid arrest, embarrassment and detention. The agencies made this plea at the joint operational visit to some parts of the Ota-Idiroko highway, especially Iyana-Iyesi, where refuse has become heaps, thereby causing serious gridlock. Speaking, TRACE Area 4 Commander, Adekunle Ajibade, said the refuse was hindering the free flow of traffic and the corps would not tolerate the indiscriminate dumping of refuse on the roads, urging residents to ensure all refuse was well disposed. According to him, the refuse had been blocking at least 70 per cent of the road, saying this was not acceptable to the state government. He appealed to commercial motorcycle riders and tricycle operators to be traffic law- abiding and cautious of other road users. According to Ajibade, no government would allow lawlessness in society, especially on roads used by thousands of people. The Ota Local Government Director of Health, Tajudeen Salami, said the council had started removing the accumulated heaps of refuse and efforts had not been noticed because of the large quanties generated the Christmas and New Year holidays. He promised that the refuse problem would soon be over in Ota in a few days.
