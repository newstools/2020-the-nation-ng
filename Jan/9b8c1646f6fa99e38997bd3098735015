 Some members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Anambra State on Sunday staged a protest following the Supreme Court judgment against the sack of Hon Emeka Ihedioha in Imo state. The Supreme Court judgement, last week declared Senator Hope Uzodinma of All Progressives Congress (APC) Governor of Imo state The PDP members, numbering over 100,  assembled at the Anambra State Judiciary complex. They were led by the state chairman, Mr Ndubuisi Nwobu . The protesters wore black to express anger over the judgement and carried placards with different inscriptions. They called on President Muhammadu Buhari to quickly wade in while also urging the judges of the Supreme Court to reverse itself, describing the judgment as a travesty of Justice. Addressing reporters, Nwobu  said: “We request that the judiciary should act as an independent arm of government” “PDP in Anambra wishes to state clearly their unreserved rejection of the Supreme Court Judgment delivered on Jan 14 2020 with respect to the Governorship election of Imo State” “They want to foist Hope Uzodinma on the people of Imo State. There is no way a panel of seven judges, no matter how erudite can sit and decide the fate of the entire Imo people, after the people have made their choice” “There had been instances where the Supreme Court reversed itself, so we are calling to question that judgment and asking the judges to accept their mistakes and remedy it urgently” PDP governorship candidate during the last election in the state, Mr Oseloka Obaze, said Apex court should be able to admit its mistakes and reverse the ruling since judges were not infallible. “The only thing that is impossible is to live forever. The judges that passed this judgment are not infallible and the things (judgment) they did is not right and they must find the courage to reverse themselves,” he stated.
