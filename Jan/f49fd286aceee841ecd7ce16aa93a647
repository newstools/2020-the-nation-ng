The 4 bedroom mud house located at a scattered Fulani settlement was then demolished with the use of two tractors in the presence of the newsmen under heavily armed security personnel, headed by Major Ibrahim from the 35 Battalion, Katsina. Later a group of youths from the neighboring environments who were overwhelmed by the ongoing demolition exercise and the heavy presence of security in their area, rose in support by chanting songs in Hausa which when interpreted means “success has come we are now relieved from bondage of the wicked and set the place ablaze.” Hundreds of people at the neighboring Malamawa town who thronged the Malumfashi- Dankanjaba road junction hailed the demolition team as they came out of the forest and showering encomiums on Governor Aminu Bello Masari for decisively dealing with the bandits. Investigation by the nation revealed that the recent offensive onslaught by the state Government against some of the bandits who defied its recent 2 day ultimatum has cause many of them to flee Katsina to the neighboring states.
