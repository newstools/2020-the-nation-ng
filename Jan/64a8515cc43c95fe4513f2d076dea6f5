 THREE people have been reportedly killed, over alleged chieftaincy tussle in Ankpa Local Government Area of Kogi State. It was gathered that claims among two clans over which of them produces the chief in Akwu community snowballed leading to the death of the victims, Wednesday night. Sources who pleaded anonymity said that the disagreement over the Onu Akwu stool has been on for years and had led to litigation. “We were sleeping when we heard commotion from the eastern part of the community and when I came out, some houses were already on fire,” said a source. He noted that 20 houses were razed in the clash which lasted over five hours. According to him: “We retrieved three bodies and evacuated many injured to health centers and hospitals in Ankpa and environs.” Among the houses burnt were those of the administrator for Ankpa LGA, Mr. John Aduga, whose kinsman is said to be one of the contenders to the chieftaincy.
