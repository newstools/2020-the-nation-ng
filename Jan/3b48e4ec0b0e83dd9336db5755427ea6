New Inter Milan signing Victor Moses will wear the number 11 shirt for his new club, Nerazzurri have revealed. The wing-back, who joined the Italians on loan from Chelsea, is expected to play a major role in their Serie A and Europa League efforts in 2019-20. It was soon announced that Moses would take up the notable shirt number at San Siro, following in the footsteps of compatriot Nwankwo Kanu, Lukas Podolski, Sulley Muntari and Andrea Pirlo. The 29-year-old who becomes Antonio Conte’s fourth signing after Romelu Lukaku, Alexis Sanchez and Ashley Young played 78 times in over two seasons the Italian presided over at Chelsea. After Conte’s sacking by the Londoners in 2018, Moses struggled to break into the first team under Maurizio Sarri before exiting to join Fenerbahce on an 18-month loan deal in January 2019. “I’m happy to be here. I’ll give my all and want to help the team. There’s a lot of quality here, I want to make my contribution on the pitch and enjoy myself. That’s the most important thing,” the Nigerian told Inter TV upon the completion of the move. He could make his debut when Inter host Cagliari in Sunday’s Italian topflight.
