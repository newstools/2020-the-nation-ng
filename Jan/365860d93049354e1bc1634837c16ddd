By Muyiwa Lucas  A group of freight forwarders under the aegis of Association of Registered Freight Forwarders of Nigeria (AREFFN), has commended the Finance Minister’s approval for the collection of Practitioners’ Operating Fees (POF) from freight forwarders. In a statement issued in Lagos and endorsed by it’s Board of Trustees Chairman, Ejike Metu and Secretary, Innocent Elum, the group described the decision as one that will assist the Council for the Regulation of Freight Forwarding in Nigeria (CRFFN) in raising funds for it’s operations. “In sync with our National Executive  headed by Alhaji Bala Usman Daura, the Board of Trustees (BoT)  of Association of Registered Freight Forwarders, Nigeria (AREFFN)  commends Federal government’s progressive and unequivocal commitment to the professionalisation and repositioning of the Freight Forwarding practice in a challenging knowledge-based global economy. “The recent approval granted by the Honourable Minister of Finance  to the Council for the Regulation of Freight Forwarding in Nigeria’s (CRFFN’s)  proposed Practitioners Operating Fee (POF) geared  towards proper funding of the Council’s programmes and policies is yet another welcome development.  AREFFN stands on all fours in support of the POF policy and has directed her numerous members across the country to key into it,” the statement read. The body expressed her members’ readiness to partner with government in advancing the nation’s economy, and cannot lay back from playing a key role in  making the POF policy a  success. “Contrary to the sentiment expressed by few industry players,  we submit that POF collection cannot in any way heighten cost of cargo clearance; it will rather reduce same,  as practitioners would pay far less   to Council than they   pay their  different Associations as presently constituted. “As a partner in progress with Council,  AREFFN  encourages her to fast-track commencement of the  POF collection in view of  the enormous responsibilities waiting for her attention.” the statement read.
