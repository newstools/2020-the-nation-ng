By Robert Egbe  The Jewelry Marketers Association of Nigeria has praised the anti-money laundering efforts of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC. The group commended in particular, the EFCC’s Special Control Unit Against Money Laundering (SCUML) for its anti-money laundering sensitisation efforts on Designated Non-Financial Institutions (DNFIs). The association’s Secretary-General Muktar Jega spoke during a recent visit to the Head, SCUML, Hanafi Baba-Ahmed at the Commission’s Wuse Zonal Office. Jega said the association’s partnership with the EFCC had made it easier for its members to effectively play their role in the fight against money laundering by reporting business transactions that do not follow due process. “In the past, when you are invited by the EFCC, people will think you stole something or committed a crime, but we now know that it is our responsibility to report our transactions to the Commission because they are our regulators,” Jega said.  The Jewelry Marketers Association delegation was accompanied by the Association of Casino Operators of Nigeria. Responding, Baba-Ahmad expressed happiness at the visit and noted that the SCUML’s “routine sensitisation” on DNFIs was necessary in EFCC’s fight against money laundering. He said the purpose of inviting the association and other DNFIs for the development of a joint anti-money laundering programme for 2020. Other members of the delegation included Muhammad Aliyu, Waseel Safariyyah Global and Oni Mobolaji Johnson, among others.
