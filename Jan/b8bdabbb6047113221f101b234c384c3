With the fixtures for the next FIFA World Cup qualifiers now known, the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) and its marketing partner, HotSports have confirmed their readiness to transmit all the six matches involving the Super Eagles in the second round. This follows the confirmation by the right owners that the nation’s largest television network will be granted access to the matches on its free-to-air and satellite channels. Nigeria, paired in Group C with Cape Verde, Central African Republic and Liberia, will begin their campaign for Qatar 2022 ticket against the Lone Star in the first week of October. NTA provided exclusive transmission for Africa’s second round draw conducted at Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Cairo on Tuesday. That signalled the determination of NTA and HotSports to meet the yearning of Nigerian football fans, which look forward to watching the matches of the national football teams in the comfort of their homes or other centres. According to the President/CEO of HS Media Group, Taye Ige: “brands and other businesses are therefore guaranteed rewarding returns on their investments in the broadcast and other sponsorship activities for the national teams.”
