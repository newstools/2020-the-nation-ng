The police in Lagos have arraigned a 39-year-old fake lecturer, Mr. Isaac Obi, at an Ojo Magistrates’ Court. He is charged with three counts of false pretence, fraud and stealing. Prosecuting Inspector Simon Uche told the court that the defendant allegedly committed the offence on November 1, 2019 in Lagos. He alleged that the defendant presented himself as a lecturer from the University of Lagos to Lucky Ikeduba. The prosecutor also alleged that the accused lied to Ikeduba that he could help him secure admission into the university. He said the defendant requested and obtained N250,000 from the complainant to “facilitate” the admission. The offence, Uche said, contravened sections 78, 287 and 314 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State 2015. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty. Magistrate A. A. Adesanya admitted the accused to N100,000 bail with two sureties in the like sum. He adjourned the case till March 4.
