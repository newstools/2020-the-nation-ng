The Lagos State Government has empowered 40 youth fish farmers in Badagry to bring food and nutrition security to rural economy. They were given 40 cages of 1,000 juvenile catfish each. The empowerment is under the State’s Cage Culture Project, designed to boost economical use of open water to develop aquaculture and improve nutrition. Disclosing this yesterday during  an inspection tour, the  Commissioner for Agriculture, Gbolahan Lawal explained that cage culture system of fish farming is one of the ways being championed by the State Government to maximise the benefits of the abundance of water resources which accounts for about 22 percent of the State’s landmass. Lawal described the system as an environmental friendly way of increasing fish supply in the state as well as increasing foreign exchange spent on fish importation adding that the cage culture would create employment opportunities both directly and indirectly. He explained that the cage culture system is a cheaper method of fish rearing which allows for fish to be reared in their natural habitat, stressing that no fewer than 40,000 fishes would be harvested at the Afowo fish farm, Badagry, at the end of the 4- month rearing period. “I am particularly happy and satisfied that the local community has shown its unflinching support for this initiative right from the installation stage. I am even more delighted that the cages were constructed with native material and the fish would be fed just like in concrete fish ponds,” the Commissioner stated. Lawal further observed that the caging project was a continuous one with farming sites in the riverine areas of the state including Eti-Osa, Ikorodu, Ojo and Epe local government areas.
