 The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) Zamfara Sector Command, on Monday, advised the newly-promoted officers and corps marshal of the command to redouble their efforts towards attaining the objectives of the corps. The Sector Commander, Wihioka Uchechukwu, gave the advice while decorating the 49 newly-promoted personnel with their new ranks in Gusau. Uchechukwu said that the essence of the promotion was to expose the personnel to higher level of responsibility and ensure that they exhibited more commitment to the progress of the corps. While commending the promoted officials, he urged those who could not make the list to put in more effort in the next promotion exercise. He lauded the command’s personnel for recording the lowest number of road accidents in the state in 2019. Earlier, Iro Danladi, Deputy Corps Commander in charge of Operations (DCC), had expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the 2019 promotion examination, saying that the command recorded the highest number of successful candidates for the first time. He said that such results would, no doubt, boost the morale of the command’s personnel in the discharge of their duties. The Emir of Gusau, Alhaji Ibrahim Bello, expressed happiness with the outcome of the examination, noting that 19 out of the promoted personnel were from the state.
