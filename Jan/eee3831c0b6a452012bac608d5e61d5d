By Sampson Unamka  THE Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, Ojaja II, recently took out time to tour the newly built EbonyLife Place luxury cinema to watch “Your Excellency” comedy movie. On hand to welcome the monarch was CEO, EbonyLife, Mo Abudu, who gave him and his entourage a tour of the facility’s restaurants, VIP lounges, poolside, Cinemas screens, rooftop and boutique hotel. Following the tour, the Ooni and his family settled down to view the movie “Your Excellency”. A keen observer of Nigeria’s politics, the Ooni enjoyed the fun-filled, satirical story of a bumbling, billionaire businessman and failed presidential candidate, who becomes a credible contender when his dance moves and gaffes ignite social media. HRH the Ooni of Ife said, “I really loved the film. This was a very realistic depiction of our political scene and shows the current reality of Nigeria.”  Like many of their fellow Your Excellency cast members, who were busy greeting audiences in other cinemas across Nigeria, Seyi Law, Deyemi Okanlawon, and Toni Tones were in the foyer to welcome the special guests and other lucky viewers. EbonyLife Place is becoming a regular haunt for notable personalities such as Iyabo Ojo, Rykardo Agbor, Fred Amata, Keppy Ekpeyong Bassey, Nimi Akinkugbe and Joke Silva were also present that evening. Delighted at the royal visit, Mo Abudu said, “It was such an honour to receive the Ooni and his family. This is why we make family-friendly movies for Christmas – we want to be sure that everyone can come out and watch them together, with no restrictions. It was more special to be able to host His Royal Highness in our own VIP cinema, a space truly fit for a king.”
