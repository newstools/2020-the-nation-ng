The Post Master General (PMG) of the Federation and Chief Executive Officer of the Nigeria Postal Service (NIPOST), Dr Ismail Adebayo Adewusi, has promised to improve the condition of the agencyâ€™s workers. Adewusi made the promise during his interaction with the workers at NIPOST headquarters in Abuja. He said, having studied the operations of the organisation, he was in a position to assure the personnel that his plans for NIPOST would begin to manifest within his first 100 days in the saddle. Adewusi, who was Commissioner for Finance as well as Budget and Planning in Lagos State, was appointed PMG in December 2019 by President Muhammadu Buhari. When he visited NIPOST facilities in Lagos, the PMG urged the workers to give their best and promised to reposition the agency to international standards.

According to him, NIPOST has great roles to play in the realisation of a digital economy.
