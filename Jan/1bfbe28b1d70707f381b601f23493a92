By Chris Oji, Enugu Office of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Nsukka local government area of  has been burnt down by unknown persons. The burning of the office in Nsukka was said not to be unconnected with the campaign bickering of the forthcoming local government election in the state. PDP chairman of Nsukka LGA, Mr Fabian Onah confirmed this in an interview in Nsukka yesterday. He said he was called in the morning that part of the building has been set ablaze. “When I got the call, I immediately rushed to the party office to see for myself the level of the inferno and extent of damages. “The target was my office as everything in my office was destroyed by fire. “All the chairs, tables, documents and other office equipment were destroyed.,” He he was told the arsonists scaled the party office, broke up the window blinds, pour petrol, light up fire and set the office ablaze. “I wonder what is the intention of those behind putting the PDP office on fire. “Other parts of the party office are not torched as those behind the crime concentrated on my office where vital documents are stored,” he said.
