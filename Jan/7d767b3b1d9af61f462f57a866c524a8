 Poland on Thursday put an end to Team Nigeria’s dream of competing in the table tennis team event at the ITTF World Team Olympic Qualifying Tournament holding in Gondomar, Portugal. On Wednesday, the Polish ladies also defeated Team Nigeria 3-0, but in the men’s battle, the game lasted for four hours with the European side advancing to the last 16 where the eventual qualifiers will be decided. It was a big win for Poland over Nigeria and their hero was Jakub Dyjas, who after beating Aruna Quadri, also defeated seven-time Olympian Segun Toriola 3-1 (10-12, 11-8, 11-6, 11-8) to give Poland a 3-2 win. The Polish team raced to a 2-0 lead to the surprise of the Nigerian fans who were mobilized by the team. Samuel Kulczycki and Marek Badowski beat veteran Segun Toriola who partnered Olajide Omotayo 3-1 (11-9, 12-10, 9-11, 11-2). And the Polish side doubled their lead as Dyjas upset Quadri 3-1 (11-7, 10-12, 13-11, 11-5). But Team Nigeria was fired back as Omotayo and Quadri defeated Poland’s Marek Badowski and Samuel Kulczycki, to bring the overall score to 2-2. Toriola lost the final match to Dyjas despite his (Toriola) heroics to end Nigeria’s dream in the competition.
