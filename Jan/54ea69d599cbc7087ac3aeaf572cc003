By Daniel Essiet  In light of the challenging business environment, the top consideration on the minds of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) is ensuring sustainability this year and beyond. One of those who share this thought is President, Association of Micro Entrepreneur of Nigeria (AMEN) Mr. Prince Saviour Iche. Iche said there would be a lot of headwinds this year that might dampen small business growth, urging the government to take  measures to sustain the economy. Iche noted that Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) have been the strongest drivers of economic development, innovation and employment. According to him, trying economic times over the three years have made doing business across the country, particularly difficult for SMEs and entrepreneurs. He  believes this is due not only to a lack of access to contracting markets, but also a lack of funding  has  become increasingly risk-averse as the economy continues to contract.  He said access to finance had remained a critical barrier to growth as MSMEs are still finding it challenging to raise cheap funds. He advised the government to address the MSME finance gap, if small businesses are to make progress to advance economic development and reduce poverty. While this year is bound to be challenging, Iche said there were still opportunities for entrepreneurs to grow the economy. At present, the SME sector accounts for 60 per cent of the country’s formalised workforce, contributing more than 30 per cent to gross domestic product (GDP). But, despite representing a substantial component of the country’s economy, Nigeria’s SMEs face significant challenges compared to other African nations and global emerging economies.
