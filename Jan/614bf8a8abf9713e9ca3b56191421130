 FLIGHT operations have resumed at Port Harcourt International Airport after three days of closure following a bush fire. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports the fire engulfed part of the airport’s surrounding bushes on Saturday and caused delay in flights. After the fire was put out, Federal Airport Authority (FAAN) on Monday declared the airport safe for flights. A statement by FAAN’s General Manager of Corporate Affairs Mrs. Henrietta Yakubu said the airport had reopened for flight operations. She said: “The airport reopened following a careful evaluation and mitigation of the impact of the bush fire earlier reported and the dissipation of smokes around the airport. ‘’FAAN wishes to inform the public that the airport has now reopened for operations…” Some passengers said flight schedules were the same from Monday. An Arik Air passenger, Mrs, Jane Ibechi, who had a 10 am flight, was excited as she did not encounter any delay. Mr. Nna Israel said unlike the last few days, flight schedules had been stable.
