Two National Assembly members from Plateau State on Friday condemned Thursday’s killing of 13 persons in the state by gunmen and called for calm. Assailants, suspected to be herdsmen, attacked Kulben village of Kumbun District of Mangu Local Government Area. Senator Hezekiah Dimka, representing Plateau Central and Rep. Musa Bagos, representing Jos South/Jos East Federal constituency, conveyed their feelings in separate statements issued by their media aides. “It is with heavy heart full of pains we write to condole with the bereaved families who lost their loved ones in the barbaric and evil attack against the Kulben village in Mangu Local Government Area. “This is happening at a moment the Plateau Government and the good people of Plateau are celebrating the hard earned peace we are enjoying. “The forces of darkness are trying to untie the success recorded in peace building in the state. “We are appealing for calm among all the social divides in the state while government is doing everything humanly possible to ensure justice for the victims of the mayhem,” Dimka said. Bagos on his part, described the killings as unfortunate, particularly as they came barely few days into the year 2020. The lawmaker reiterated his strong stand on the need for state and community policing to safeguard lives and property. “I urge all communities to always be vigilant and conscious. “I call on the security agencies to be proactive and ensure speedy and thorough investigation to bring all perpetrators of this dastardly act to justice. “My deepest condolences to the people of Mangu/Bokkos Federal Constituency,” he stated.
