 AN Ebute Meta Chief Magistrates’ Court in Lagos on Thursday ordered the remand of a teenager, who allegedly stabbed a man to death with a broken bottle. The defendant, who is 13 years old, was earlier arraigned on a charge of murder. His plea was not taken. The Prosecutor, Insp. Chinelu Uwadione, urged the court to remand the teenager for 30 days, pending an advice from the Lagos State Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). He said the defendant committed the offence on Dec. 15, 2019 at about 6.00 a.m. at Iyana-Iba Orange Market in Ojo, near Lagos. Uwadione stated that the teenager had stabbed a man whose name was given simply as Nnamdi with a broken bottle in the chest during an argument. According to the prosecutor, the offence contravenes Section 223 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015, which prescribes death sentence for convicts. The Chief Magistrate, Mrs Adeola Adedayo, ordered that the defendant should be remanded at the Oregun Correctional Centre for Boys in Ikeja. Adedayo adjourned the case until Feb. 26, pending receipt of the DPP’s advice.
