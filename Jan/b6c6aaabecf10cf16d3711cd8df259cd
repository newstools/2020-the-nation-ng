An Iyaganku Chief Magistrates’ Court in Ibadan, Oyo State, on Wednesday ordered that a 32-year-old disc jockey, Odunayo Aliu, who allegedly took and sent nude pictures of his girlfriend, be remanded at a correctional centre, pending legal advice. The police charged Aliu, who lives in Odeku, Ibadan, with making pornographic images and sending them to people. Chief Magistrate O. A. Hamzat did not take the defendant’s plea because the court lacked the jurisdiction. Hamzat ordered that Aliu be remanded at the Agodi Correctional Centre pending legal advice from the Oyo State Director of Public Prosecutions. (DPP). He adjourned the matter till February 28. Prosecuting Sergeant Salewa Hammed had told the court that Aliu, between 2016 and 2019, allegedly took nude pictures of Bolanle Adegboye and sent them to her friend and husband. Hammed alleged that Aliu committed the offence while he was dating Adegboye. The offence, he said, was allegedly committed at the Railway Quarters, Aleshinloye, Ibadan. He said the offence contravened Section 24 (1) (b) of the Cyber-crime (Prohibition Prevention) Act 2015 Laws of the Federal Government of Nigeria. The defence counsel, Mr. Kolawole Adegoke, prayed the court to admit his client to bail in the most liberal terms.
