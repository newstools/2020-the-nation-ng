By Chinenye Ezekwe  POPULAR comedian Kenny Blaq and Nollywood actor Kelechi Udegbe were special guests among other dignitaries at Royal Chow launch last weekend. The event which took place at the company’s head office in Okota, Lagos was a beehive of excited customers who turned up for its grand opening. Royal Chow is a new food outlet which specialises in the production and sales of healthy sharwama snacks and smoothies. Kenny Blaq entertained customers with his jokes as he encouraged everyone to continually patronise and enjoy the best sharwama and smoothie in the area.  “I’m glad to be at the launch of Royal Chow. Please whenever you are at Okota or the environs please patronise Royal Chow,” he said. According to the brand’s spokesperson, Joan Unamka, “the business was born because of the pertinent need to encourage people to eat healthy and when there is a hunger for snacks, then sharwama and smoothies come in handy as healthy alternatives. “The business has the goal to try other varieties in the nearest future and promises to have the most salivating and delicious sharwama and smoothie you can ever think of.”
