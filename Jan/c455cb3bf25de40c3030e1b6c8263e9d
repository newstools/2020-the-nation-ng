Ahead of Sunday’s crucial home clash between Enyimba  and  Moroccan side, Hassania Agadir on MatchDay 5 of the CAF Confederation Cup, Chief Executive Officer of Monimichelle Ebi Egbe has  enjoined support for the People’s Elephant. Enyimba would need the maximum points to brighten their chances of progressing to  the quarterfinals of the tournament. Egbe whose outfit constructed the Enyimba Stadium turf disclosed yesterday that he would as usual move in to maintain the turf at no cost to the club, even as he further disclosed that he would also be fixing a brand new goalpost net for the game against Agadir. “Monimichelle would carry out free maintenance of the Enyimba turf before the game against Agadir and we are also going to fix a brand new goalpost net for the game,” explained Egbe. “This is our own little way of supporting the club as they battle to do Nigeria proud in the continent.” Egbe said. Egbe  would tip Enyimba to go far in the tournament  should they advance  from the group stage, adding the club’s new head coach, Fatai Osho has what it takes to deliver while the club has got in Felix Anyansi Agwu, a chairman who stops at nothing to get result. “Enyimba would beat Agadir in Aba and I see them going far in the tournament. Osho, their new manager is a youthful coach that is eager to prove a point and Anyansi on his part is a man that puts in everything to get result,” added Egbe. “Sport is a serious matter. Unfortunately, many people are not taking it serious. We need to take sports serious in Lagos State. Sports should be given to those who know how to run it. “We all know serious sports administrators; we don’t need to put politics in everything; the rest is left for the governor to make the right decision that will move Lagos State forward in sports,” he said. Salvador said that Gov. Sanwo-Olu needed to appoint those that would move the state forward in sports by reporting directly to him and updating him on current happenings in the sporting world.
