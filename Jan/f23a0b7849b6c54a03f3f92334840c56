 The Oyo State government has said public school teachers would henceforth be promoted and honoured based on their student’s performance in external examinations. Chairman of the Oyo State Post-primary Schools Teaching Service Commission (TESCOM) Akinade Alamu stated this yesterday at an interactive session with school managers in Saki zone, Oke Ogun. The event held at Ansaru Deen High School, Saki. He said: “Promotion of teachers will no longer be business as usual; the state has plans to award excellence based on the performance of students in external examinations. “In the last promotion, over 800 teachers were promoted and everybody was moved together. Though we believe our teachers are noble and hardworking, there might have been some lazy ones who scaled through without duequalifications. “This is why we are planning that at the end of every year, there must be reports on our teachers’ conducts and activities, teachers certified to be good and efficient need not wait for general promotion, they will be promoted and honoured as and when due.” According to Alamu, the interactive session will be held across the six zones to maintain a good rapport between the commission and teachers.
