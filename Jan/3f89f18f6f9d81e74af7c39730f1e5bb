A foremost indigenous socio-club in Lagos, Eko Club, has welcomed inducted members. The President, Ade Dosunmu, who ushered the 12 new members during the New Year dance, said that the occasion was set aside to correct the abnormality in the admission of the members, who were already admitted but not properly given orientation as it is the custom of the club. Dosunmu praised the dedication and resilience of the founding fathers of the club, which without doubt gave the opportunity for those coming behind as being witnessed during the event “Apart from being a New Year party for members, we are using the opportunity to correct the abnormality in the admission of some 12 members who have been admitted, but not properly given the required orientation, because as our tradition, we believe in respect for the elders, especially, the foundation members”, Dosunmu said. He urged the inductees to be ambassadors of the club by maintaining the dignity of the club as laid down by the founding fathers.
