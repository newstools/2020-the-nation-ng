A raging inferno on Monday destroyed 39 shops and furniture worth N21million at Kugbo furniture market in Abuja. Some of the affected furniture makers said that they were alerted about a few minutes after midnight by the guards. The Chairman of the City Furniture Area, Austin Onuh, who was also a victim, expressed shock about the incident. He lamented that most of the furniture burnt were given to them on contract by customers. “We are yet to find out the cause of the fire, but furniture worth over N21million have been burnt. “Some of us have just returned from the Christmas and New Year festivities and have just started the work our customers gave us, only to discover this morning that fire has destroyed the materials,” Onuh said. He appealed to the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA), individuals and corporate organisations to assist them. Onuh also urged the government to help the furniture makers provide measures that would prevent fire. Mr. Timothy Eze, one of the victims, said he lost about N8million worth of furniture. “Besides furniture, industrial machine, generators and other equipment worth millions of Naira were also burnt,” he said. Another victim, Vincent Ngutsen, said over N7million finished and unfinished furniture were burnt in his shop. He said despite efforts by good Samaritans and fire fighters, they could not put out the fire.
