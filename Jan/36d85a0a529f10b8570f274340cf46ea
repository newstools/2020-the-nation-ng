 Plateau United duo of Uche Onwuasoanya and Abba Umar have promised Katsina United a torrid time as they face the Chanji Boys in a feisty NPFL MatchDay 13 tie at the Muhammadu Dikko Stadium today. The Peace Boys are dictating the pace at the top of the league table with 24 points from 12 games and both players who contributed three goals out of the four they scored against faltering Enyimba in Jos last weekend have vowed to continue from where they stopped when they trade tackles with Katsina United. Onwuasoanya has netted three goals for Plateau United this season and he informed that they are ready to put their bodies on the line in their quest to protect their leadership of the table and also to extend their unbeaten run after the midweek battle. “We are ready for Katsina United and we want to surprise them the way we did to Enyimba last weekend,” Onwuasoanya disclosed in a chat. “We never thought that we would beat Enyimba by that emphatic margin but we have put that result behind us and are poised for another away win against Katsina United on Wednesday. “I am enjoying my game and praying for an injury free season. I have played nine games and have scored three goals. I wish to do more.” Umar whose double against the People’s Elephant improved his goals to four for the season from 10 games also corroborated the view expressed by his teammate and added that his main target is to add more to his goals tally in Katsina.
