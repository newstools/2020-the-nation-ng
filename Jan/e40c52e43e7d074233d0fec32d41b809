 A NEW legal attempt was launched on Thursday by British prosecutors to confiscate tens of millions of pounds stolen from Delta State by former governor, James Ibori. Ibori, who was governor from 1999 to 2007, had pleaded guilty to 10-count charges of laundering of state funds in Britain. He was jailed for 13 years and served the term in pre- and post-trial detention. Although he was released from jail in December 2016 and is now back in Nigeria, it seems he might lose everything to the United Kingdom (UK) and the Federal Government. According to Prosecution Counsel at Southwark Crown Court Jonathan Kinnear, who had listed assets that Britain seeks to confiscate from Ibori and return to Nigeria, “only a portion of the 117 million pounds (about $153 million) proceeds from his crime is likely to be recoverable.” In 2013, a first attempt was made in Britain to confiscate the former governor’s assets, it was however aborted weeks later due to unresolved legal disputes. Luxury properties in Nigeria, London, Washington, Houston and Johannesburg, were linked to the one-time governor.
