FOREMOST facility expert Ebi Egbe has warned that the sorry state of pitches across the country will continue to  adversely affect sports development. Egbe noted  it would be a tall order for any  national  team foreign coach to  invite home-based players to the Super Eagles  since  they usually play on undulating surfaces, adding that some of the pitches were so bad  and not fit for football matches  in the first place. ” I want to cry whenever I see our players play these pitches on TV,” the foremost facility expert noted. “ Nigeria is too advanced for all these things that are happening to our football. “If you bring the best coaches to Nigeria to coach the national team, it’s going to be so difficult for him to pick even the highest goal scorer in the Nigeria Professional Football League because of our playing surface.” He further warned  that local players might not be able to stamp their places in the national teams even in the next 50 years unless investment are made on playing surfaces to help these talents enjoy the proper standard pitches required for their development. He then advised the League Management Company (LMC) who are in charge of running the league to enforce strict rule on standard pitches for matches,  even if games can be played in four stadia. “South Africa doesn’t show all their pitches on television but when you watch Supersport, the good pitches are always shown, not the bad ones,” he explained.
