 A SINGER, Emy Paulinus, aka Emy P, has won the 2019 edition of Face of Images Television Reality Show. Emy P outsmarted 20 other contestants to win the grand prize, which included a car. The contestants were selected at the auditions held in Lagos, Calabar, Port Harcourt, Abuja and Owerri. Paulinus described his victory as a dream come true, adding that it was tough in the house but his qualities made the difference. Also, Blessing Oyetunde, aka Stephanie, emerged the first runner up; Sunday Magaret, aka Maggie, went home with the second runner up prize and Dorathy Rex, aka Dorex, was crowned the third runner up. The organisers, twin brothers, Emmanuel and Joseph Etim, said the bar was raised this year to give more youths an opportunity to pursue their dreams in the entertainment industry. Joseph Etim noted: “The show is geared towards giving Nigerian youths an opportunity to showcase their talents to the world. We mentor, showcase and connect the models to corporate brands for endorsement deals. “The contestants were camped in a house for 20 days. They took part in various modelling and entertainment tasks.”
