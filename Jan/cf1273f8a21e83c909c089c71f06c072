Rivers State Governor,  Nyesom Ezenwo Wike has declared that the Real Madrid Academy will empower upcoming football stars with the requisite formal education to effectively rule the sporting world. Addressing journalists after inspecting on-going construction of hostels and additional classrooms at the Real Madrid Academy in Port Harcourt on Thursday,  Governor Wike said several footballers were short changed in the past due to lack of formal education. He said: “We are combining education and football in this academy. We felt that while they are playing football, they should be educated. So those who don’t make it as footballers will continue with their education While those who have made it in football will also have a formal education. “Part of the problem we have had, is that most of our footballers don’t have formal education. Sometimes, it affects them in terms of negotiation and knowing what you are supposed to do,” the Governor added. He expressed satisfaction with the quality of work at the site of the hostels and additional classrooms, saying it is world class. “I am quite impressed with the quality of structures of hostels and additional classrooms. With what we are seeing, before the next academic session, this phase will be ready. “This will be the best in Africa.  I don’t know any country in Africa that will have this kind of facility”, he said. Governor Wike noted that sports is one of the outstanding economy boosters, hence the commitment of his administration to use it as a driving force to empower the youths.
