Motorists caught plying one-way will be arrested and charged to a mobile court, Police Commissioner Hakeem Odumosu warned on Wednesday. He said the court would be moving around Lagos to prosecute drivers who ply one way and others who abuse traffic rules. Odumosu  spoke at a news  conference. He said the first major challenge he faced was traffic gridlocks in different parts of the state which has a strong link with traffic-related crimes such as traffic robbery. The police chief said as a strong believer of problem-solving approach, teamwork and stakeholders’ engagement and participation, he summoned an emergency meeting of all Area Commanders, Area Operation Officers, State Traffic Officers, Divisional Traffic Officers and Traffic Officers in the Command. He also said they collectively identified the major causes of traffic congestions in the affected areas and agreed on workable solutions. He said because of the urgency the situation presented, he declared a state of emergency on traffic and followed it up with the deployment of additional 1000 Police Officers for traffic duties. He said: “We equally reviewed their reporting and closing time to 10 am and 10 pm against the initial 6 am and 6 pm to meet up with traffic peak periods. “I had a meeting with other stakeholders in security and traffic management where we agreed on multi agencies collaborations. He said the Command, with the support of Lagos State Government, deployed 200 Motorcycles to various parts of the state for traffic control and to also combat the menace of traffic robbery.
