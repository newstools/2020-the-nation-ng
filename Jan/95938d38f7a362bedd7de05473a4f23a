Cross River State Governor Ben Ayade is satisfied with the quality of roofing tiles produced in the state-owned roofing tiles factory in Yala Local Government. Ayade, who visited the factory after it begun test-production, said the factory would reduce importation of tiles. According to him, the factory was equipped with the latest technology. He said his administration established the factory to enhance the social housing policy of his government. He said: “When I was a senator, my first bill was on social housing. Housing for all should be a right because Section 14 (2) of the 1999 Constitution provides that the primary purpose of government is the welfare and security of  its citizens…’’ The governor added that having completed the factories, his government would now build social housing schemes. According to him, the state would witness ‘a massive construction … to provide houses for the poor, as well as advanced and sophisticated houses for the rich…’ “I believe with this programme, every Cross Riverian will have a roof over his or her head. The creation of the Ministry of Social Housing and Ministry of New Cities was …to take advantage of this factory for the benefit of our people,” he added.
