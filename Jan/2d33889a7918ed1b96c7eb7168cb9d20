NOLLYWOOD top actress, Rachael Oniga has been unveiled as an ambassador of Iloshe Property and Investment Limited. At the event held at the company’s headquarters in Iyana Ipaja, Lagos, Ilose also unveiled ace broadcaster, Taiye Akinpelu as its media executive. Another top Nollywood actor, Mr Rammy Shita Bay, who is also an ambassador was also present at the event. Speaking on the deal, Oniga said she was highly honoured to be part of Iloshe. “I thank the God Almighty for where I am coming from, where I am and where I am going,” she said. “I am happy that I am relevant in the industry. A lot of people know me that I am a lover of what I do. I love to motivate and see people grow. When they ( Iloshe) came to me, I decided to make some enquiries about them. I found they are people I can trust. I cannot work with someone I cannot vouch for.  “No matter how much you offer, if I find you wanting I will have nothing to do with you. If I discover that somebody pays them for a piece of land and he  is not given his land, I will be the first to say it out. I know that by the grace of God and hard work, Iloshe will go places.” Explaining the choice of Oniga, the Managing Director/CEO, Michael Fabiyi, said: “I did a search before choosing her. Her name resonates. We have seen her record and the list of organizations she has branded.” The General Manager, Mrs Oyinlola Obot, said Iloshe started operation two years ago, adding: “The purpose is to be able to reduce if possible stop the challenges of homelessness. We are out to provide shelter for people. We have integrity as our core value and very consistent in everything we do.”
