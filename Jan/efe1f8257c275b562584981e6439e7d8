For 12 years, Mbataku Clarke, has been pondering owning a recording company. The dream has finally come to reality with the signing of talented duo, Ifeanyichukwu Chigbo Kennedy, aka Verchi, and Franklin Ibe, aka F2, to Dream Empire Music. Clarke’s aim is to see people with the same idea accomplish what he could not achieve. He said: “I want young persons to accomplish their dreams, especially the talented ones. I am really interested in music but I cannot do music; so, l decided to invest in young and vibrant talents.” He said it was a rigorous process to settle for both Verchi and F2 as his first signees. A native of Anambra State, Orumba South LGA, Verchi has worked with top names like Seyi Shay, Skales, Harrysong, among others. The other signee, F2, hails from Ehime Mbano Local Government Area in Imo State.
