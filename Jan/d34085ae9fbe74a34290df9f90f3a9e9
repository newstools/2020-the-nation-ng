 RESIDENTS ofÂ  St. Saviour road, Benin-City, Edo state, were taken aback when they saw an injured man running the street holding an intravenous drip. The young man, who wore only pants, had bandage on his head while blood flowed down his body. People ran away when they saw him. When our reporter interrogated him, he said he was attacked by some boys and labeled a criminal. He refused to give his name. Further questioning made him to say he fled the Specialist hospital because the people that took him there abandoned him. Officials at the hospital refused to comment on the incident.
