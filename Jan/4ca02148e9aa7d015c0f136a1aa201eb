 Four gunmen have kidnapped a yet-to-be-identified woman living in Aba, Abia State. Eyewitnesses said that the daughter of the woman was also abducted. The incident reportedly occurred on the Umuocham Road in Osisioma Local Government. Sources said the gunmen operated in a Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV), while the woman was said to be driving a Honda CRV with a passenger, who was later understood to be her daughter. The sources said the gunmen, who carried pump action guns, after overtaking and forcing the woman and her daughter into their car, drove off in the Honda CRV. The Nation gathered that the woman and her daughter might have been monitored by the hoodlums from the city centre without their knowledge. A source at one of the security agencies in Aba, who preferred anonymity, confirmed the incident. The source said the victims’ family is yet to lodge a complaint. “We can only take action if a complaint about the incident is made by the affected family or even relations,” the source added.
