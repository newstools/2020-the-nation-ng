The Elephant Club of Ogba, a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), has donated items worth N1. 5 million, for community schools in Ogba and its environs, to enhance learning and teaching. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that 14 primary schools within and outside Ogba and Agege communities benefited from the kind gesture at a ceremony held at the Ogba Ashade Palace, in the Agege Local Government Area on Sunday. Prince Jelili Ashade, the Adele of Ogba, in his remarks thanked the NGO for the kind gesture by donating to the schools for the benefit of the children. Ashade, who is also a member of the club, said that the donated items would go a long way in enhancing both the teaching and learning process in the schools. “The items will go a long way to help both the teachers and the pupils in the classrooms. “The generators and the printers donated would help the schools print their documents, examination and test papers, without stress or delay. “I just want to advise both the teachers and the pupils to make good use of the opportunity and ensure they are used for the right purposes. Wole Ogunlolu, the guest speaker at the occasion, also advised the pupils, to always read their books, instead of spending most of their valuable time on social media. Ogunlolu, who is the founder, Centre for the Redemption of Yoruba Civilisation Art (CRYCAT), urged the pupils to cultivate the habit of reading from primary school level, rather than focusing on what is going on social media.
