The Rivers State Police Command on Friday denied having a hand in Chima’s death. Spokesman for the command, Nnamdi Omoni, said in a statement that the autopsy conducted on the remains of the deceased showed that he had a high level of sugar in his system. Omoni, a Deputy Superintendent of Police, who also confirmed the arraignment of four other suspects in the matter, said they are at the Port Harcourt Correctional Service and that the Commissioner of Police has ordered investigation into the incident, which he said has already commenced. DSP Omoni pleaded with family of the victim and members of the public to remain calm while the police conclude their investigation. He said:”As a Command, we are aware of that incident and our attention has also been drawn to the online publication. “The briefing we have received from the Commander of E-Crack, SP Adetuyi is that the man died in detention and they had to conduct autopsy on him and found that he died of high sugar level. “He confirmed that all the people mentioned were arrested for crime and while they were in custody, Chima died. Others who were arrested with him are in court and they are in ATM. “The Commissioner of Police has directed the DC State CID to review the matter and that has commenced already. “If at the end of the day they discover that cause of death is as result of negligence of our men either covertly or overtly, they will go in for it. “We just want to appeal to members of the public and the family of Chima to please be patient with us. Let them give us time to get to the root of this matter.”
