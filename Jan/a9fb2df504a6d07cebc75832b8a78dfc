 A board member of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Aisha Falode, has declared that the dividend of the Oyo Unity Cup, a grassroots football competition sponsored by the  Minister for Youth and  Sports Development , Sunday Dare, will soon manifest. Falode, said as much at the Soun Stadium, Ogbomosho, Oyo State, that  the grassroots competition, is aimed at boosting the development of football and sports generally in the country. Falode, who is also the Chairperson, Nigeria Women Football League, noted that, a sizeable number of future football stars would annually be discovered from the grassroots football competition. “All the country’s top soccer stars were discovered from the grassroots. This is a nursery for the national teams and club football. “You cannot build a house from the top, it must be from the foundation and the Oyo Unity Cup represents the foundation, the grassroots. This is a platform to identify football talents we all need as a country to service the various football clubs and the national teams. This is what we have seen here today.” Also, former Super Eagles player and former assistant coach of the Super Eagles, Daniel Amokachi, has applauded Dare on the launch of the tournament. Amokachi expressed delight to be at the launch of the competition which he said will go a long way to improve football in Oyo state and the nation as a whole. “I am honoured to be in Ogbomosho today (Saturday) and I am sure my colleagues are too. When Dare was named the Minister of Youth and Sports Development, we all applauded it. Going by his background and the fact that he is a young man, we were sure that we were in good hands. “This is someone who has passion for the youth. All the Ministers who have come into the Nigerian Sports environment have mistakenly set their only focus on the Nigerian Super Eagles but now we have a Minister who is doing all he can to touch every sport,” noted the  former Everton striker.
