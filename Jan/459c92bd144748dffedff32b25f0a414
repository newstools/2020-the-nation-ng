The Director General of National Information Technology Development Agency, (NITDA),Dr Isa Patanmi, has reassured Data Protection Officers (DPOs) of the readiness to engage with them so as to ensure compliance with Nigeria’s Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) 2019 which aims at protecting individual and collective privacy, security, and confidentiality of information protection. Panama gave this hint at the weekend at the DPOs’ workshop held in Lagos. NITDA, he said, is not oblivious of the fact that the need to create more awareness about the NDPR act and strengthening the implementation through coordination and partnership with the DPOs of the organisations is essential. Panama, who was represented by the Head, South West Zone, NITDA, Chioma Okee-Aguguo, admitted that compliance to the NDPR act is a long journey and an ongoing process.
