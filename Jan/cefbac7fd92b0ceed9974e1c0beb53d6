2019 Carnival Calabar was one or two notches above the previous ones. It ended on a high note with the International Carnival on December 29, leaving both local and international participants asking for more. But there was no more the year. Fast forward to December 31st, on board a local plane at a 34, 000 feet cruising altitude, from Calabar to Lagos, a member of the Brazilian contingents decided to continue with the ‘party after party’ by entertainment the cabin crew and passengers on the air. One of the cabin crew was her ‘victim’ as she tweaked continuously on his laps. Finally, she was eased off him with huge applause from passengers.
