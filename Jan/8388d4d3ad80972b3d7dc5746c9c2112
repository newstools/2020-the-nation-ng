The Minister of Youth and Sports Development Sunday Dare commended wrestling sensation Odunayo Adekuoroye for winning gold in the 57kg class of the Mattei Pellicone Ranking Series tournament in Rome. The Minister praised the former world number one for knocking out her opponent Indian Anshu Anshu 10-0 via technical superiority to clinch the gold in her category. “I am not surprised. She is a true representation of the never-say-die Nigerian spirit. She is always eager to win laurels for the country. Don’t forget she was adopted at the Adopt Initiative launch. She will get all the needed support to train and continue in that manner. We as Nigerians should be proud of her,” the Minister added.
