The Navy has begun a manhunt for gunmen, who killed four naval ratings and abducted two foreigners at Agge coastal area in Ekeremor Local Government Area of Bayelsa State. It was gathered that the incident occurred when the gunmen seized a dredger escorted by the operatives of the Nigerian Navy Ship (NNS) Delta last weekend. The gunmen were said to have attacked Sterling Global Dredger, causing heavy gun battle between them and the ratings. The gun battle, which reportedly lasted for hours, led to the killings of four ratings, with others sustaining injuries. The hoodlums were said to have seized the dredger, abducting two Russians and one Indian. The foreigners were said to be working for the company at the Agge River before they were taken away to an unknown place. Sources said the gunmen suffered some casualties during the gun duel. It was learnt that the navy deployed more troops to comb the creeks and apprehend the hoodlums. Although naval authorities were yet to speak on the matter, a security source confirmed the incident. The source, who spoke in confidence, said it occurred on January 4, adding that the gunmen came from the creeks to launch the attack. He said: “On January 4, gunmen, who came from the creeks, attacked and killed four naval personnel. They kidnapped two Russians and one Indian, escaping through the creeks to an unknown destination.”
