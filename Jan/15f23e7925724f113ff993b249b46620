From Juliana Agbo, Abuja  Oil Palm  Growers Association of Nigeria (OPGAN) has expressed concern over the low quality of palm oil produced in the country due to lack of processing machines. Its National President, Mr Igwe Uche, who made this known in an interview, said the nation’s  palm oil was  rejected in the international market due to its quality. Uche, who said the oil palm farmers have met the requirements needed by the Central Bank of Nigeria(CBN) to access loans for this year’s planting season, said they were yet to get the funds. He said some oil palm farmers and millers had procured processing machines while they await funds from the CBN to kickstart production.  According to him, “our rural farmers produce oil in a very large quantity without a marketing quality. He said their challenge  was the collateral requested by the CBN. He explained that any land the farmer plants  on belongs to him and could be used as collateral. On planting, he said the support from CBN may not be useful, if it comes when the farmers could no longer plant because of limited rainfall. “If there is any way they can do that fast because this is the time so that people can plant seedlings, this is the time to clear the bush. “I suggested to them that disbursement of funds should be done in February, so that farmers can plant during the rainy season”, he added.
