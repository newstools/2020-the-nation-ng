Eni has extended its deal with the BW Offshore-owned Abo floating production, storage and offloading unit off Nigeria. The Italian major will now hold onto the floater on its operated Abo field off Nigeria until the end of the fourth quarter next year. Eni also holds optional contract extensions out to the end of 2021, BW said on Tuesday. In early July, Eni extended its deal with the FPSO until the end of this year, with options running to the end of 2020. The floater has been in service at Abo for the Eni subsidiary since production started in 2003. BW Offshore said in its first-quarter report in May that a contract extension was on the cards.
