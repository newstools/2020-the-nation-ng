 NIGERIA will require between $83billion and $85billion yearly to implement the Sustainable Develeopment Goals (SDGs), the United Nations Organisation (UNO) said on Tuesday. Its Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator, Edward Kallon, who spoke in Abuja, said the Nigeria Integrated Sustainable Development Goals (ISDGs) modelling result of last year showed that total investment needed is estimated at about $350billion while the public sector gap is $100billion. He said the focus for this year would be on scaling up investment in SDGs, capturing the benefits and making adjustments to remain on track in implementation, as the success of the country will depend on how it is done. Kallon spoke at the Retreat for Civil Society Organisations in Nigeria at Abuja, with the theme: The Role of civil society in the decade of action to accelerate the implementation of SDGs in Nigeria. According to him, it is 10 years to go to deliver the SDGs and kick off the reaffirmation of the 2030 promise by mobilising the government of Nigeria, the civil society, businesses, and calling on all Nigerians to make the SDG their own project. The Senior Special Assistant to the President on SDGs, Mrs Adejoke Adefulire, said through the retreat, there would be space for effective engagement between and the representative of CSOs with a strong national network to localise SDGs at the local levels, raise awareness and sensitise citizens on their roles in the achievement of SDGs.
