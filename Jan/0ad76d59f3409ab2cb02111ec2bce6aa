By Okodili Ndidi, Abuja  Less than one week after Chad withdrew its troops along the Cameroonian borders, Boko Haram insurgents have struck in the market town of Gamboru in Borno State, killing no fewer than 30 persons. The Nation learnt that the terrorists blew up a crowded bridge with Improvised Explosive Device around 5pm at the peak of the local market. Gamboru is one of the towns that leads into neighboring Cameroon, which has suffered several attacks by the Islamic sect. Eyewitnesses in the market town said more than 35 injured people were taken to the local hospital following the attack. According to one of the eyewitnesses, Modu Ali, said: “It is an unfortunate day for us to witness this frustrating and devastating incident in our community. I just heard a loud sound of explosions, before I realized I saw many of our friends and colleagues were killed”. Meanwhile, efforts to get Military authorities to commend on the incident were abortive. The Nigerian Army Operations Media Coordinator, Colonel Aminu Iliyasu, responded via test message that the area in question “is MJTF area”. However, spokesperson of the Multinational Joint Taskforce, Colonel Timothy Antigha, did not answer his calls or respond to the text message sent to his phone.
