 FRESH facts have emerged that not all the leaders and governors of the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) were in support of the street protest against the Supreme Court and the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad, to seek the review of the judgment against ex-Governor Emeka Ihedioha. Unknown to many, there was a split among the opposition governors on the desirability or otherwise of such an action. The division became evident when it was realised that the PDP Governors Forum  did not issue a statement to mobilise party leaders and members to join the protest. Also, some South-East and South-South governors pretended as if no protest was being staged. A South-East governor was heard saying: “I cannot be a party to mudslinging against the Judiciary. We warned some of those behind the protest to think of tomorrow.”
