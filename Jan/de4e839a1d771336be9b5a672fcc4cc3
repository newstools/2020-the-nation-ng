 A PLANNED attack by the Boko Haram sect on an Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camp in Gamborou-Ngala Council Area of Borno State has been repelled by troops of the Operation Lafiya Dole. Some of the insurgents including those strapped with suicide vests were killed in a gun duel with troops, it was gathered. The terrorists, according to a statement by the Nigerian Army Operations Media Coordinator, Colonel Aminu Iliyasu, were headed to the IDP camp in five gun trucks, motorcycles and scores of foot soldiers before they were engaged by troops who spotted their movement. According to the statement “in a unique display of courage and resilience on their part, troops of 3 Battalion (Main) Operation Lafiya  Dole  deployed in Gamborou-Ngala LGA of Borno State gallantly repelled a Boko Haram attack on the Ngala Community. “The criminal insurgents sneaked into the peaceful community in five gun trucks, motorcycles and a number of foot soldiers through the rear of a Humanitarian hub using a farm as cover with the heinous intent to unleash one of the most devastating terror attacks in recent times. “Fortunately for the residents, the vigilant troops responded swiftly, engaging the criminals with overwhelming superior firepower, thereby forcing them to beat a hasty retreat in complete disarray”. “During the ensuing pursuit and exploitation embarked upon by the troops, one Boko Haram criminal suicide truck driver strapped with a suicide vest was neutralised. “Items captured during the encounter include one AK 47 rifle, one FN Rifle, one motorcycle and one heavily laden vehicle borne improvised explosive device with deadly explosive materials.
