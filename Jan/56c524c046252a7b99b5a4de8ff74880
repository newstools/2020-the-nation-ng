The Kwara State Government has announced the physical reclamation of the plots of land bordering the civil service clinic in Ilorin. The reclamation exercise, which began in the early hours of Thursday, according to a statement by the Commissioner of Information Murtala Olarenwaju, was to avoid any needless confrontation. He said: “Attempts by some persons to provoke government’s agents on lawful duty were resisted by the security agents who exercised the highest level of restraint and professionalism. “Contrary to the claim that the State Government was served court papers on the matter, we state that no court paper has been served as at the time the government took steps to preserve what lawfully belongs to the people. “Finally, we urge the people of the state to remain calm, peaceful, an be guided only by facts of the matter and not be drawn into emotional outburst that is targeted at distracting the public from the issues at stake. “While the administration is focused on restoring sanity to the state after years of barefaced impunity, we will do so within the limit of the law.”
