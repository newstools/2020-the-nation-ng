 SWISS President of Association of Nigeria Women Football Clubs’ Coaches (ANWFCC), Hans Kramer has predicted a splendid pre season All Stars Football carnival kicking off officially on Wednesday, January 8, 2020 at the Hockey Pitch of the National Stadium, Lagos. The All Stars Carnival now in its 24th edition would feature several young women footballers to be drawn into 20 teams with target of helping them get bigger clubs ahead of the next Nigeria Women Football season. Hans Kramer who is also a member of  the Local Organizing Committee confirmed that the presence of past and present Super Falcons Players like Perpetua Nkwocha, Ann Agunmanu – Chiejine, Stella Mbachu, Yinka Kudaisi, Celestina Onyeka, Ayisat Yusuf amongst others would guarantee a carnival like opening ceremony and top competition among the young players coming from different parts of the country. While enjoining the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) and Nigeria Women Football League teams to send their coaches and other officials to scout for talents at the ANWFCC’s Football carnival ending January 18, 2020, Kramer is confident that the Players would be at their best playing in front of their idols and scouts. “Our objective is to provide the right platform for players to confirm their readiness to play for top teams. We hope officials of the NFF and clubs would appreciate our gesture through being on ground to get true young and talented under 15 and under 17 players”, said Kramer who has been vital for the Association in last 20 years of ANWFCC’s 24 years of existence. Training and Registration of Players would be done between Monday and Tuesday before action starts Wednesday.
