In his younger days as a juju music singer, Sir Shina Peters, was tagged a playboy. The impression was that he was always seen with different women. But all those stories now look like fairy tales as the singer has continually shown his wife, Sammy, love and care. Years ago, Sammy was reportedly down with a cancer-related illness. While she battled the ailment, Peters didn’t forsake her and did everything to ensure she got adequate treatment. At Sammy’s recent 60th birthday party at Time Square Event Centre, Ikeja, Lagos, the couple were all over each other’s arms like new lovers. If one wasn’t careful, he could have mistaken the day for a wedding anniversary. They were not shy to share kisses publicly like lovers who just tied the knot. Peters and Sammy have been married for 25 years, having wedded in 1995. Sammy is also a stepmother to popular music video director, Clarence Peters, who Shina had with Nollywood actress, Clarion Chukwura.
