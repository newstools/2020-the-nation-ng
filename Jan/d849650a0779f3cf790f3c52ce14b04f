THE Life President of Nigerian Professional Golfers Association, General Ibrahim Haruna (Rtd) and prominent  legal luminary, Mr Joe Gadzama (SAN), King Alfred Diete-Spiff, the Amanyanabo of Twon Brass, at the weekend commended  the Bayelsa State Governor, the Honourable Seriake Dickson for establishing Bayelsa Golf course. The top golfers, who spoke at the inaugural tournament and commissioning of the Bayelsa State Golf Course in Yenagoa, commended the Governor for his foresight and commitment in establishing the sporting and recreational facility. “This is a money spinner and if I may say so, in the future it will make much more returns than it will get from the stock exchange. We should keep the vision on and develop it because it is something that will be beneficial to everybody from the lowest man in the social strata to the elite.” On his part, Mr Joe Gadzama commended the Governor for translating the noble dream to reality and assured that he would do everything within his reach to ensure that the objectives that inspired the crucial  project are achieved.
