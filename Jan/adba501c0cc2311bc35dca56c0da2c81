Lagos State government has commenced the installation of 2,000 tricycles and okada prohibited areas signs across the metropolis. This is a renewed effort towards creating awareness on the Lagos State Traffic Laws on restricted areas for the operation of motorcycles popularly called okada and tricycles in the state. Commissioner for Transportation Dr. Frederic Oladeinde said a good number of the road signs indicated areas where tricycles and motorcycles operations were prohibited, warning that any one that violate the law after this effort would be punished in accordance with the dictate of the law. Oladeinde explained that the road signs which have been mounted on major highways including the Third Mainland Bridge, Agege Motor Road, Apapa-Oshodi Expressway, Lagos-Badagry Expressway and Lagos-Ibadan Expressway would further create awareness on restricted areas for okadas and tricycles as prescribed by the government. Oladeinde explained that motorcycle and tricycle operations remained restricted on highways and bridges in all the Local Government Areas including; Apapa, Ikeja, Ikoyi, Surulere, Eti-Osa and Lagos Island, which according to him would be covered adequately with the signs  to ensure that road safety culture is engraved in the consciousness  of road users across the state. The Commissioner urged Lagosians to cooperate with the state government’s initiatives to tackle traffic gridlock in the metropolis as it will provide faster result in decongesting the highways of traffic which in turn will create a seamless movement of goods and service that will ultimately improve the state’s economy.
