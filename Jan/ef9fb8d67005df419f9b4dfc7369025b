Katsina State Police Commissioner Sanusi Buba on Tuesday decried the payment of ransom to kidnappers. He said it is fuelling kidnapping and other crimes. Sanusi, who spoke at the end of year news conference, said that addressing the kidnapping scourge was made difficult in the passing year by the payment of ransom to criminals. He said that if the victims had cooperated with the police by resisting the fear of the unknown as meted out to them by the criminals, kidnapping would have been made less lucrative. Sanusi said: ”Cooperating with the police during the trying moments of the victim, especially by providing information and the needed cooperation in handling the aspect of payment of ransom and other related actions will push the kidnappers out of job.” He listed some of the achievements made by the command in the passing year to include: arrest of 1,907 criminals, who were nabbed in connection with 1,519 cases, prosecution of 1,256 suspects in courts, killing of eight cattle rustlers, arrest of 170 suspected armed robbers and 106 kidnappers The police boss said 11 AK 47 rifles, one Tovo-21 rifle, two English pistols, 24 locally made guns, 394 live ammunition and 48 cartridges were recovered by the command.
