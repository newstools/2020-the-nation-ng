 THESE are not the best of times for former Oyo State governor, Dr. Victor Olunloyo. The Second Republic governor is down with stroke at his Ibadan home, and his biggest challenge, Sentry learnt, borders on getting the money to buy his drugs. The financial condition of the ex-governor is said to be so precarious that a few thousands matter to him a lot. His health was believed to have deteriorated on account of the “neglect” he has suffered from successive governments in the state. Sentry’s findings revealed that the administration of ex-Governor Abiola Ajimobi had shown some concern until he had a political disagreement with Olunloyo’s wife, Ronke. Worried by the octogenarian’s ill-health, a Nigerian professor based in the UK got in touch with a key official in the administration of Governor Seyi Makinde for a bailout, but the official, who was a member of the House of Representatives, did not draw the attention of the governor to his plight. The former Rep was said to be angry that Olunloyo was not there for him politically when he needed him.
