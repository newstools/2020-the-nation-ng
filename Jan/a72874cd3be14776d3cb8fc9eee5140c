Two prisoners were on Friday released from Israeli detention months after Syria returned the remains of an Israeli soldier killed during a 1982 conflict between the countries. According to Israeli media reports, the freed prisoners were Syrian citizens from Druze village in the Israel-controlled Golan Heights. They were released before the end of their sentence.
according to the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the release was a goodwill gesture after Syria’s April return of the remains of Zachary Baumel. Baumel went missing on June 11, 1982, during the first Lebanon war. According to the Israeli prisons authority, one of the men had been sentenced to seven years and eight months for the death of a Syrian man. He was set for release in 2023. The second man had been incarcerated for 11 years on charges of treason and espionage as well as aiding terrorism and was set for release in 2026. Israel had already released two Syrians from prison in April after the return of Baumel’s remains. Russian President Vladimir Putin, said they were discovered during Russian operations in Syria amid that country’s civil war. (dpa/NAN)
