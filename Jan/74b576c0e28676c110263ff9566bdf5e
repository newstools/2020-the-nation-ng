 Nigeria flag bearer Aruna Quadri on Wednesday secured a spot in the main draw at the on-going German Cup following a dramatic comeback from a 3-0 loss to eventually trump 4-3 against Finland’s Olah Benedek. He later in the day completed his journey to the main draw with another convincing 4-2 win over Czech Republic’s Pavel Sirucek in the fourth round of preliminary to confirm his place in the elite stage of the tournament. The feat ranks as one of the best comeback win at the ITTF World Tour otherwise known as the German Open as the Nigerian restored his place in the competition on a day when majority of the top players were shown the exit in the third round of preliminaries. From the start of the encounter on table five against Benedek, it was as if Quadri did not come to the party as the Finnish who was the 2016 Champion of Nigeria Open dominated the first three games that in less than 30 minutes he took a 3-0 (7-11, 8-11, 12-10) lead over the Nigerian. But the never-say-die spirit of Quadri on the table changed the tone of the tie in the fourth game when he overwhelmed his opponent with three successive wins (11-6, 11-7, and 11-6) to set a deciding encounter in the seventh game. From the start of the seventh game, Quadri took the lead with a 4-2 margin but the European restored parity at 4-4 and went ahead to take the lead at 4-5. But Quadri’s superb forehand shot was too much for the Finnish star to handle as the Nigerian won the next three points to take a 7-4 lead. Thereafter, the Finnish took a 7-8 lead but this prompted Quadri to change tactics and this worked for him to put the game beyond his opponent at 11-8 which earned him a standing ovation at the GETEC Arena in Magdeburg. Unlike Quadri who is a match away from securing his place in the main draw, Quadri’s compatriot Olajide Omotayo was not that lucky as he was beaten 4-0 in the second round of the preliminary by Korean Cho Seungmin to kiss the tournament goodbye.
