 The newly-promoted Ajia Balogun of Ibadanland, Chief Adegboyega Adegoke, has urged the Federal Government to assign constitutional roles to traditional rulers by amending the constitution. Adegoke spoke during his promotion and installation by the Olubadan, Oba Saliu Adetunji Aje Ogunguniso. Thirteen others were also promoted. The monarch, who is the former Mogaji of the Abose family, said there was need for the government to involve traditional rulers in governance since they are closer to the people. He called for constitutional amendment by the National Assembly to accommodate the roles for monarchs in governance. He said: “Traditional rulers are closer to the people than local government chairmen. It is very hard to see anyone who will not recognise his monarch, but he may not even know his chairman. “So, for democracy to thrive, there is need to involve traditional rulers in governance. The government should not always wait till there is a crisis or election before running to traditional rulers for intervention. They should be part of government at the three tiers so that this democracy can thrive.” Those elevated were Chief Gboyega Orogunmodi (from Bada Balogun to Oota Balogun of Ibadanland); Chief Adetunji Lanihun (from Gbonka Olubadan to Aregbe-Omo Olubadan); Chief Babajide Ayoade (from Ajia Balogun to Aregbe-Omo Balogun); Chief Dauda Gbadamosi (from Are Onibon Olubadan to Gbonka Olubadan) and Chief Adetokunbo Akintola (from Jagun Balogun to Gbonka Balogun Ibadanland), among others. The Mogaji Aderoju Olasunkanmi of Aladorin family was also promoted to the Jagun Olubadan Ibadanland and Mogaji Olatunji Arulogun of Enimowu Arulogun family is now Jagun Balogun Ibadanland. Oba Adetunji hailed the chiefs for their contributions to the development of Ibadanland and urged them not to relent in supporting development projects in the city.
