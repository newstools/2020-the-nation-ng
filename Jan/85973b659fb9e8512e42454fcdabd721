He has always grinded his teeth in the face of difficulties to move forward,” declared Ba. “Faced with difficulties, he fought, last year, at home, he did not win but that did not prevent him from fighting to get this crown. This is the lesson that we must take from his coronation.”  El Hadj Diouf has been the only Senegalese to win the honour, completing a double – 2001 and 2002.
