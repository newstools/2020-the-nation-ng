Adekunle Jimoh, Ilorin  The current policy of the Federal Government to close its borders is not meant to witch-hunt or obstruct legitimate businesses, Coordinator, Joint Border Drill Operations in charge of North Central zone, Sector three, Comptroller Mohammed Garba has said. He added that the policy is to encourage local farmers, control the inflow of arms and ammunition, illicit drugs and other prohibited goods in and out of the country. Mr. Garba said this in Yashkira, Baruten local government area of Kwara state during a sensitization/enlightenment tour of some border communities in the area. He, therefore, sued synergy and collaboration amongst security agencies and traditional leaders, adding that no organization will work in isolation and succeed without the support of one another especially
traditional leaders. At the Emirâ€™s Palace of Yashkira, the Customs boss said acknowledged the critical role the traditional institutions/rulers can play especially in the areas of sensitization and enlightenment of their subjects, relevant Stakeholders and society at large. In his remark, Emir of Yashkira, Umar Sarki Sabikpasi II said that Nigeria Customs Service is almost the heart of the nation in revenue generation.
