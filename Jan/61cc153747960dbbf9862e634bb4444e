After his appointment on Monday, Quique Setien took charge of his first session as Barcelona coach on Tuesday morning even before putting pen to paper on the contract. Arthur who continues his recovery work has joined the team for a part of the training. There was no sight of Jean-Clair Todibo, however, who is reportedly still set to join Schalke despite the managerial change. As a reminder, Barca new boss is set to officially sign his Barcelona contract this afternoon. Setien replaces Ernesto Valverde who was sacked on Monday night. The 61-year-old was without a job since his Real Betisâ€™ resignation in 2019. He is already liked by Barca fans because of his coaching style which is inspired by late Johan Cruyff.
