By Damola Kola-Dare  An educational  non-profit organisation based in the United Kingdom (UK), Professors Without  Borders (PROWIBO), is set to take its educational activities to the country having been to other African countries such as Uganda,Sierra Leone and Senegal. The Director and Co-founder, Dr Caroline Varin, noted that over the past four years, the organisation  has remained committed to improving higher education around the globe by providing free skills-based training programmes for university students and professional staff members. “Over the past four years, we have been committed to improving higher education around the world by offering free skills-focused training programmes  for university students and professional staff.Our lecturers have come from top universities across the globe, including Cambridge (UK), the London School  of Economics (UK) and McGill University (Canada) to  teach small groups of 25 students at a time,” she said. Speaking on the organisaton’s  activities in the past year, she said: “Last year, we sent 15 academics and professionals  to teach in Uganda, Sierra Leone, Senegal, Thailand and India where they instructed students  in courses such as Finance for  Africa, Social Entrepreneurship, Communication, Decision-Making and Negotiations, Business Law and Design Thinking.  Our success is measured in the invitation to return to teach in the same institutions year after year,the true partnerships we build with local institutions,the accomplishments of our students and retention of our volunteers.” Varin, who disclosed that their next port of call is the University of Lagos (UNILAG), noted that PROWIBO  believes in giving equal access to quality education and inspiring teaching experiences, hence, they organise free and open classes for all students. She stated the organisation has had a great impact in African countries like Sierra Leone and Uganda. “To give you examples of our impact, after one programme in Freetown,students put together a recycling scheme in their school; graduates from our training scheme at Fourah Bay College have co-written and published academic papers with our lecturers; in Uganda, we held research methodology classes for professors to access leading publications in their field,and in India we co-hosted a teaching methods class for local instructors alongside our volunteers,” she disclosed.
