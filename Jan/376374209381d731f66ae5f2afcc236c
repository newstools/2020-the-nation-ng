He was accused of demanding ransom from the parents of the missing toddler. In the charge sheet, the accused was alleged to have threatened the wife of Sotitobire Miracle Centre’s founder, Bisola Alfa, through a text message claiming that the boy was with him and demanding N800,000 ransom for his release.

According to the three-count charge, the offences contravene sections, 509, 406 and 407 of the Criminal Code Cap 37 Vol 1 Laws of Ondo State 2006.
