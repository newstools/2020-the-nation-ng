The establishment of Western Nigerian Security Network (WNSN) code-named Operation Amotekun, by the Southwest Governors, has been accompanied by fears and misconceptions. Endorsed by the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, it is fashioned to function as a community policing in response to the yearning of the local people. Amotekun is all but these below: Regional Police: While the comments are thriving as to whether they will operate as region police, one of the Governors Rotimi Akeredolu has stated that it will not operate as a regional police force, therefore, it is not an idea in the embryo to introduce state police. “We are not creating a regional police force. We are not oblivious of the steps we must take to have state police. “Some of us are unapologetic in our belief in state police but we are also-law abiding citizens. We know the lawful steps to be taken to achieve that but that won’t stop us from taking steps to provide security for our people,” the Ondo governor emphasized during the launching on Thursday in Ibadan, Oyo state capital. Alternative to Nigeria Police Force: Amotekun security is not an alternative to the police and therefore, does not possess the constitutional powers vested in the Force alone. Fear to be used for political purposes: another fear of the critics is channeled towards the potential to be abused or converted as a political instrument for governors’ whims and caprices. Amotekun cannot be deployed Amotekun for political purposes. While the Development Agenda for Western Nigeria (DAWN) Commission is still working on the grey areas in Amotekun’s operational guidelines, members will be drafted from local hunters, vigilantes and designated members of the Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC) as personnel and police. The headquarters will be in Ibadan and the operation will be controlled from Gbongan in Osun State.
