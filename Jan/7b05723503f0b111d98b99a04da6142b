 The Osun State House of Assembly has confirmed Justice Foluke Eunice Awolalu as the substantive President of the Customary Court of Appeal. The Speaker, Timothy Owoeye, at yesterday’s plenary, said: “The appointment of a person as President of the Customary Court of Appeal shall be made by the Governor of the state on the recommendation of the National Judicial Council (NJC), subject to the confirmation of such appointment by the House of Assembly of the state.” Owoeye said the Assembly relied on Section 281 (1) of the Constitution to confirmed Justice Awolalu’s appointment. The Assembly also suspended the embattled chairman of Osogbo South Local Government, Abdulhakeem Olaoye, for two months. Olaoye was ordered to handover to the Vice Chairman. Owoeye said the joint committees of the House, having examined and investigated various allegations against Olaoye via-a-vis his response, found him wanting of the allegations of gross misconduct. He said: “The chairman, having failed to comply with Section 3, 4A (iv) and (v) of the ‘Guidelines for the Administration of Local Government Areas, Local Council Development Areas, Area Councils and Administrative offices in the State of Osun, 2018’, should vacate his office for two months, beginning from Monday January 13 to March 12 2020. “The suspension doesn’t remove the chairman as a parliamentarian, he still represents his people as a councillor, but the Vice Chairman will be in acting capacity. The chairman will return to his position after the suspension expires.” The Assembly also rejected the vote of no confidence passed in the chairman of Olohunda council, Munirudeen Anisu. Owoweye said there was no credible evidence to pass a vote of no confidence in Anisu chairman the allegations of gross misconduct levelled against him.
