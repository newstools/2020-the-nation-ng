In the sight of gospel artistes who worship at Christ Embassy, Pastor Chris Oyakhilome can do no wrong. He is behind their growth and they feel indebted to him. Saki Whyte, better known as Pastor, has joined the numerous gospel artistes who have benefited from the clergyman’s generosity. He received a car and $10,000 as reward and gift from Pastor Oyakhilome, at the Christmas Eve and New Year Day services respectively. At the Christmas Eve Concert, Pastor Chris announced a new award from Loveworld, the Christian Entertainment Awards, aimed at recognising amazing performances of the night. Saki’s song, ‘Lights,’ emerged as the best song of the night, winning $10,000 as prize. Also, at the 31st December, 2019 Crossover Night Service, Oyakhilome announced that he had a special gift for the singer. Then in the morning, January 1, Saki posted on Instagram that he just received a new Hyundai Sonata from his pastor.
