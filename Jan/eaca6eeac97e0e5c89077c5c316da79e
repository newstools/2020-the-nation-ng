 Chairman of Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) Referee Appointment Committee, Sharif Rabi’u Inuwa (Ahlan) has re-echoed his stance on wielding the big stick on referees found wanting and performing below standard in all competitive football matches across the nation. The NFF executive board member made the assertion when he was hosted on a local radio programme in Kano at the weekend. The Kano State FA Chairman added that there would be no sacred cows in his quest to bring the best out of Nigerian referee to compete with their counterparts across the globe in accordance with international best practices. “I have said this on several occasions that the standard we had set for Nigerian referee is uncompromised as no referee found wanting will go scot free.” “We will definitely take decisive action against any referee who performs below the standard we have set for them.” “I don’t care whether a referee is from Bayelsa , Kano, Ondo or Taraba, if you fail to live up to expectation, the committee under my watch will take necessary punitive action against you.” Inuwa further noted 52 referees have been suspended for performing below while assuring that his committee will be steadfast in discharging their duties.
