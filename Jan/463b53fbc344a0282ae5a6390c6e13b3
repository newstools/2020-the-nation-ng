All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain Dr. Olusegun Abraham on Tuesday lamented that Yoruba had relegated itself to the background. He said the race had been carried away by its relative advantage of education, thereby neglecting other indices of progress. Abraham urged the race to drop its arrogance and embrace the reality that other regions were leaving it behind because of their progress in other sectors. He told our correspondent on the phone that Yoruba had neglected agriculture, adding that it relied on food supply from other regions. Abraham said: “We should drop our arrogance as a people. We say we have education. But, we are depending on food from parts of the North.” We are educated, but we depend on Dangote for cement. “Southwest was president for eight years. What came out of it? Within four years, Buhari did train to his village and established a university.” “What has Southwest produced? Kebbi is giving us rice. We pay for it. What is our pride? What is the meeting of our Southwest governors about at Premier Hotel, Ibadan? Igbo have even taken all our lands in Yorubaland. We should wake up. Education is not enough.”
