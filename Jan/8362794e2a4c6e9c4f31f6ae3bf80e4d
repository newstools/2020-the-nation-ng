Beta Glass Plc has reiterated its commitment to complete its $30 million furnace capacity expansion at the Beta Glass subsidiary’s Guinea Plant in Agbara, Ogun State on schedule in June 2020. Its Chairman, Otunba Bimbo Ogunbanjo, said this during a meeting with the Minister of Industry, Trade & Investment, Otunba Adeniyi Adebayo, in Abuja. He said the company has made considerable progress in engineering and construction works on the furnace capacity expansion and is on track to complete the project on schedule. He added that the new furnace would increase the plant’s production capacity by 35,000 tons per annum and create additional employment opportunities. The minister commended the firm for the investment in its Agbara plant and assured of Federal Government’s support to the project. The Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of Beta Glass Plc and Frigoglass Industries (Nigeria) Limited, Mr. Darren Bennet-Voci, said the incremental capacity would help the company meet the growing demand for its glass bottles and jars  as well as boost its exports to neighbouring West African countries. He confirmed the introduction of the Narrow Near Press & Blow (NNPB) technology for the first time in West Africa, enabling the company to produce light-weight non-returnable glass bottles. The plant’s capacity expansion will also include an additional production line, improvements to existing production lines and a new quality inspection facility that would further enhance the plant’s operational efficiencies.
