 Scores of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) members in Ondo West Local Government Area of Ondo State State have joined the All Progressives Congress (APC). The defectors were received by the governor’s Senior Special Assistant (SSA) on Research and Documentation, Kunle Adebayo. Leader of the defectors Akinyosade Akinlolu reiterated their determination to work for Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu’s reelection. APC youth leader Akinuli Femi allayed their fears, stressing that they will get equal treatment. Sarafadeen Adewale; Kayode Adefisoye and Ibrahim Oloruntele, who spoke on behalf of the defectors, said it was the sterling leadership qualities of Adebayo that encouraged them to join the APC. They pledged to work to deliver their political units and wards for the party in this governorship election. Adebayo hailed their courage, determination, and assured them of equal opportunities in the party. According to him, there are two parties in Ondo State – the APC and the PDP – and so the options are clear for people to choose from. He said: “The option is that of prosperity and development versus oppression and poverty, between hope and exploitation, between development and exploitation.” Adebayo urged the defectors to justify their joining the APC with serious mobilisation for the governor’s victory in their political units and wards.
