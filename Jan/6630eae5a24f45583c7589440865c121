President Muhammadu Buhari has ordered seamless air attacks on areas occupied by bandits ravaging communities in Niger, Kaduna and Zamfara states. The President’s order followed assurances that harmattan haze, which previously hampered military air operations, is gradually clearing out. According to a statement issued by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, the military air operation against bandits, kidnappers and cattle rustlers that have been attacking remote communities around Dogon Gona forest in Niger State will commence this week. The President, who described the repeated attacks leading to the losses of several lives in the communities “as a disaster for the nation,” had authorized the deployment of air power to support troops and policemen deployed to the “difficult terrain,” to counter the menace of the attackers operating in the forest area bordering Kaduna, Niger and Zamfara states.

The Police Command in Niger has equally given assurances that the planned dedicated air raids to complement the police helicopter gunship operations remain the best approach given the lack of motorized roads in the areas constantly under attack. President Buhari commiserates with the government and people of Niger State following the attacks and the loss of lives that followed, and assures that victim communities in the state will not be abandoned by the rest of the country.
