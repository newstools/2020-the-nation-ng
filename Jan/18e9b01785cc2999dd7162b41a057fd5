A tanker loaded with 33,000 litres of Premium Motor Spirit leaked some of the inflammable product it was conveying around Ajileti, on Idiroko road, Ogun State, causing a fire that burnt two vehicles beyond recognition. The Idiroko unit Command of Federal Road Safety Corps, on Saturday, told News Agency of Nigeria in Ota, Ogun, that the accident happened about 4.30 pm on Friday. The Idiroko Unit Commander of FRSC, Mr Akinwunmi Olaluwoye, explained that the tanker, which was loaded with PMS and filled to the brim, leaked and caused the fire. The unit commander said no life was lost in the incident but the development disrupted traffic flow in the Ajeleti area on Idiroko road. “The FRSC wants to enjoin all tanker owners to install safety valves on their vehicles so that life could be saved when they spill their contents on the road,” he said. Olaluwoye also said the FRSC had begun a public enlightenment campaign to educate motorists on the dangers inherent in some unwholesome practices. He further implored tanker owners to properly maintain their vehicles before putting them on the road to avoid unnecessary loss of lives and property. (NAN)
