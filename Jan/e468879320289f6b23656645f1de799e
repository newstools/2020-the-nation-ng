From Adekunle Jimoh, Ilorin  The Consultancy firm in charge of University of Abuja’s (UNIABUJA) students fee management, Edutech Portal Solution, has questioned alleged attempts to vary the original terms of the agreement by authorities of the university. The firm claimed that having got contract on June 28, 2019, it had added values to the university fee portal system. Solicitors to Edutech Portal Solutions, Lanre Falola and Co in letter to the University of Abuja Vice Chancellor expressed dismay at  alleged plans by the university  management to shorten the lifespan of the contract. The letter, entitled “Re: Demand for immediate release of the consultancy agreement for the deployment of students fee management portal between Edutech Portal and UniAbuja and warning against any breach thereof,” signed by Judith Eyo on behalf of solicitors said, “we have since noticed an attempt to vary the original terms of this agreement as agreed by our client and the negotiation team from your office which invariably will be at variance with the advertised term of the reference and extant provisions of rules of public procurement acts.  “This act was ably demonstrated via  a letter dated 15th March, 2019, signed by one Rifkatu Hoshen Swanta which attempted to reduce the terms of the said contract to a ‘one- year finality terminating the contract.’ This was further reinforced by another letter from the office of the Registrar to our client signed by one Prof A.A Kolawole which sought to terminate the contract in nine months. “Our client has since commenced work on the university portal blocks and has in deed added significant values to the university fee portal system by developing automated hostel bookings and artificial intelligence in a record time and adapting some course materials to the National Universities Commission open and distance learning format at no cost to the institution among others. “Through regenerated portals deployed by our client, the internally generated revenue of the university has further increased by over 200 percent on its undergraduate school fees. “Be informed that upon execution of the said consultancy agreement by parties, the contract was consummated and legally binding.”
