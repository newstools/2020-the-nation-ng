Gunmen have kidnapped a 75â€“year old woman, Mrs. Fehintola Wewe, at Sabomi in Ese-Odo Local Government Area of Ondo State. The incident occurred barely three weeks after hoodlums reportedly abducted the wife, children and driver of the traditional ruler of Odigbo town, Oba Rufus Akinrinmade. The victims were kidnapped on the Ikare-Owo Expressway in Oba Akoko, Akoko South West Local Government Area of Ondo State. Mrs. Wewe was said to have been taken away by the gunmen last Friday when they raided the area and left with valuables. A family source said the case had been reported at Igbekebo Divisional Police Station. It was gathered that the family was yet to hear from the abductors. Police spokesman Femi Joseph, a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP), confirmed the incident. He said that the command was intensifying efforts to rescue the woman alive. Joseph said policemen were combing the forest to arrest the culprits and free the woman.
