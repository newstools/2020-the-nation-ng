A Plant-based consumer products firm Upfield has reaffirmed its commitment to human and capital investment in Nigeria. The company’s General Manager, West Africa, Bamidele Amao, said this was part of its commitment to deepen relationship with key stakeholders. Amao, however, stated that the support of the government, including the Lagos State Government, would help improve the value the company could bring to the country as it enters the market. He spoke during a visit to the Lagos State Government, represented by the Lagos State Commissioner for Commerce, Industry and Cooperatives, Dr.Lola Akande. Amao said Upfield was aware of the commercial potential of Lagos State and Nigeria, hence the desire of the company to invest in the country. He said: “Nigeria remains one of the largest, if not the largest economy in Africa. The Federal Government and indeed the Lagos State Government continue to attract investment through some dynamic policies. ‘’This is with a view to investing in areas where the country has competitive advantage to grow its Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) and Gross Domestic Product (GDP).” “At Upfield, our commitments are clear; investing in human and capital resources that would serve in creating employment and improving the standard of living in the communities and countries where we operate. “We pride ourselves in providing high-quality products that better the quality of life of our consumers to be healthier and happier.
