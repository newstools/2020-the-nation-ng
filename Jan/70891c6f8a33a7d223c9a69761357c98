Agency Reporter Super Eagles star Uche Agbo has dropped down to the Spanish second-tier with Deportivo La Coruna after cutting short his loan spell at Portuguese club SC Braga. The defensive midfielder arrives on loan from Standard Liège of Belgium until the end of the season with an option to sign a permanent deal. The 24-year-old, who can also play as a central defender, spent the first half of the season on loan with Braga but found game time difficult to come by, featuring only in five games across all competitions. He has previously had stints in Spain, playing for Granada and Rayo Vallecano. He rejected a lucrative offer from China to join Rayo Vallecano on a six-month loan deal in 2019 and played 31 times for Granada in the 2016/2017 La Liga season. Agbo, who had previously played for Nigeria at the 2013 U-20 World Cup, made his senior debut for the Super Eagles in a 3–0 win against Togo in a friendly replacing Wilfred Ndidi in June 2017. He was included in Nigeria’s preliminary 30-man squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia but was dropped without playing in any friendly game before the tournament.
