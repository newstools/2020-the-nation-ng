 Nigeria -born British boxer Anthony Joshua has presented his belts to President Muhammadu Buhari (PMB) in London on Saturday. The Pugilist, who reclaimed his titles from Mexican boxer Andy Ruiz (Jr)in December in Saudi Arabia, proudly flashed the belts to the admiration of the President and some members of these cabinet, members of the diplomatic corps and Head of the Diaspora Commission Abike Dabiri-Erewa. The commission in recent times has been paying increased attention to Nigerians abroad, hailing those who have made positive impact in their careers on one hand and projecting positive image of the country on the other. While Anthony Joshua who continues to relish his re-claimed title, he is however under pressure to agree on terms to fight Bulgarian boxer Kubrat Pulev or face losing his IBF world title. The IBF have told AJ he must defend his title against Pulev – who pulled out of facing him 2017 while Usyk is in line for the WBO belt. A spokesman for the governing body told Sky Sports: “I have just been told that the Pulev and Joshua camps have asked until January 31 to negotiate.” While the pressure mounts however the Nigerian-British boxer will continue to enjoy his hard earned victory and he did not leave anyone in doubt he was happy presenting the belts to the Nigerian President and other appreciative Nigerians even as boxing fans continue to await his promise to come to Nigeria to celebrate the victory officially.
