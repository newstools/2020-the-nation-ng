The Plateau Commissioner of Health, Dr Nimkong Ndam, has on Friday confirmed five cases of Lassa fever in the state. Ndam told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Jos that the patients of the ailment had been admitted in two hospitals in the state, adding that three of them were undergoing treatment; one had completed treatment, while the fifth one had been discharged. He said Lassa fever was not new in the state because the area had experienced the disease before. “However, the health personnel are on ground to handle the situation and they have the required protective kits to wear while treating such cases. “We are in contact with the hospitals in the state to address such cases promptly and to curtail spread of the disease.We also have the protective kits required of health workers to wear when treating such cases,” he said. NAN reports that Lassa fever is transmitted to humans through contact with food or household items contaminated by infected Mastomy rats who are hosts of the Lassa virus. Storing grains and other foodstuff in rodent-free containers and general hygiene is a preventive measure.  (NAN)
