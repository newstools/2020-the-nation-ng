Abatan also advised that members should vote for only those who possess the right qualities to move the association in the region to an enviable height. National General Secretary of the association, Dr.Â  Adeagbo Kamaldeen, said the association had had to deal with too many issues of late, adding that had affected its growth. He added that the government support being clamoured for could only be achieved when peace thrives.
