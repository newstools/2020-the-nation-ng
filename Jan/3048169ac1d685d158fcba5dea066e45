The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has said its Lagos zonal office had arrested Mark Obisesan, said to be an ex-convict, for possession of suspected fake traveller’s cheque valued at $10,000. The anti-graft commission stated this in a statement on Tuesday by its spokesperson Wilson Uwujaren in Abuja. Uwujaren said the suspect, who had served a 12-month jail term for Internet fraud in the United Kingdom (UK), was arrested recently at his home on Banana Island, Lagos State. The spokesman said Obisesan’s arrest followed intelligence from concerned members of the public about his alleged criminal activities.
