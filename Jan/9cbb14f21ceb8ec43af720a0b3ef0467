 A DAY-old baby has been rescued from cold and death on a roadside in Minna, the Niger State capital, where the mother was said to have dropped her and left. The baby’s mother was not identified but children in the area said they saw her dropping the baby early Sunday morning opposite the Central Mosque and hurried away on a motorcycle. The baby was taken to the Child Rights Agency yesterday. It was learnt that the children who saw the woman informed their parents of the development. . While others were scared of going close to the baby, a woman, Hajiya Fatima Adamu, picked up the baby and took her to the police station. She said she was moved when she saw the baby, who no one seemed interested in rescuing. “When I came to the scene, I saw people gathered where the baby was dumped,” she said. “I inquired and was told that an unknown woman alighted from a motorcycle and dumped the baby. “At the scene, everybody was afraid to touch the baby; this was because nobody saw the person that dumped the baby except the children that were outside the house. “It was the children that immediately informed their parents but before they came out, the bike had zoomed off with the woman. The parents alerted the neighborhood and everyone rushed to the scene. “I and a vigilante member that lives in the area had to pick up the baby when nobody made a move and we both went to report the matter to Central Police Station. The police officer on duty collected the baby and promised to take the matter before the Child Right Agency that treats issues about children and women and ensure their welfare.” The police officer Hassana Usman who took the baby to the Child Rights Agency said the child was not given a post-birth bath before she was dumped. “I appealed to a woman that lives close to the station to assist me with hot water and I had to bathe the baby.” Receiving the baby, the agency director, Kolo, lamented why a mother would carry a pregnancy for nine months only to dump the baby.
