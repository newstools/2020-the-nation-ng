 The World Soul Evangelistic Ministry (WOSEM) founded by the late Prophet Timothy Obadare will hold a week-long power-packed revival in Akure, the Ondo State capital, from January 26 to 30. The revival with the theme: “God of our Fathers,” is to also celebrate the golden jubilee of signs and wonders as it was given to the late Prophet Obadare during his lifetime. WOSEM General Overseer, Dr Paul Obadare, who announced this at a press briefing in Lagos, said the revival would hold at the M.K.O Abiola Democracy Park, Akure. He said the revival would be a power-packed one, as the power of God remained as ever since the time of Baba Obadare, adding that the event would also celebrate the legacy left by late cleric. According to him: “Ko sehun ti is a prayer meeting of no compromise, full of the power of God, miracles, signs, wonders and integrity of the ministry. The glory of God and his angels will descend from above.” He enjoined all and sundry to attend the revival to receive the blessings of God from heaven. He added that many anointed servants of God would be ministering during the revival. Ministers of God at the press briefing included: Pastor Dapo Ajagunla, Pastor Paul Adenuga, Pastor Joseph Ojo, Pastor Joseph, Lady Evangelist Abigail and Pastor Aderogba Michael.
