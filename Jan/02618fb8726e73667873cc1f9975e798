 ’Tigress point and shooting guard, Sarah Ogoke-Ejiogu, has denied retiring from basketball, adding she was still available for national team selection. Ogoke-Ejiogu led Mozambican side Ferroviario de Maputo to a successful defence of their title at the FIBA Africa Champions Cup for Women (ACCW) in Egypt in December as they beat Inter Clubbe of Luanda 91-90 after overtime. She scored 22 points and picked seven rebounds to inspire the back-to-back champions in front of a fully-packed Cairo Indoor Stadium and she wondered where rumours of her retirement from basketball emanated from. She said: “Show me where I wrote that I was retiring from professional basketball. I don’t know where this rumour came from. Please it’s not true. “I am still active and my talent has not disappeared to hide anywhere. I’m still the same high-scoring athletic 5’11 point /shooting guard that knows how to win. “I’ve had countless 20+ point games in FIBA competition to help Nigeria win big games and three weeks ago I just won my first FIBA Africa Champions Cup for Women (ACCW) gold medal. This is something hundreds of fully active players have not even accomplished,” stated Ogoke Ejiogu who had previously won three gold, one silver and two bronze medals for Nigeria. Reflecting on her latest success with Ferroviario de Maputo at the ACCW, Ogoke-Ejiogu described the tournament as a great experience, noting that it was nice to play against some of the best point guards at the championship. “Winning the FIBA ACCW was amazing. It was a great experience because I was in head to head competition with some of the best guards in the world in Italee Lucas of Interclub and Kelsey Mitchell of the Indiana Fever  who played for Al Ahly,” added Ogoke-Ejiogu, who debuted for Nigeria in 2011.
