The rapper, who visited Lagos and Accra in Ghana in December, had been gushing about adopting Nigeria as her country since beginning of the year. On Monday, she took to her Twitter handle to ask her fans to help her choose a nsame between Chioma B or Cadijat. “Let’s settle this once and for all CHIOMA B Or Cadijat,” she tweeted. Earlier, she had tweeted to her fans to convince her husband, Offset, to move with her to Nigeria. “Convince him to move with me.” Cardi B’s decision to move to Nigeria trended on the Internet and her fans got on the bandwagon of creating names.

It’s sad this man is putting American lives in danger. Dumbest move Trump did till date… I’m filing for my Nigerian citizenship.” Twenty-seven year old Cardi B was born Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar on October 11, 1992, in Manhattan and raised in The Bronx, New York City. The rapper, songwriter and television personality became an Internet celebrity after several of her posts and videos became viral on Vine and Instagram.
