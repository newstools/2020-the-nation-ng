 PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari has urged auditors to deploy the powers they have to fight corruption and properly sanitise the hitherto ineffective system of accountability in the country. He spoke yesterday in Abuja, during the second Auditors-General in Nigeria conference with theme: “Building government audit institutions Nigeria needs for the 21st Century.” Expressing concern over ineffective audits that had contributed largely to governance problems over the years, he urged auditors to embrace good governance, accountability and transparency, in order to rid the system of corruption. He said: “As accountability institutions in the federal, states and local governments, and as the institutions empowered under the constitution to review the financial performance of public officers even where there has been no petition or allegation, you are uniquely placed to tackle corrupt practices. “Through your audit findings and recommendations, corrupt practices would be discovered early and loopholes blocked before they are exploited. “Furthermore, you have the full range of audit tools at your disposal including financial compliance, performance and Information Technology audits. “There is literally no aspect of government performance or expenditure you cannot examine. What may be missing is the will to properly deploy the powers that you have. “In which case, I will remind you that under-performance by auditors, or ineffective audits, contribute largely to governance problems. Auditors therefore need to decide not to be part of the problem but the arrow to the solution.”
