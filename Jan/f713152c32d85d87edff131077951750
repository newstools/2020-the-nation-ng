 Mr. Nathan Sharibu, the father of Boko Haram-abductee Leah Sharibu, has said the family had surrendered the fate of their daughter to God. Mr. Sharibu was reacting to reports on Saturday that his daughter had been delivered of a baby to a Boko Haram commander after staying in the terrorists’ captivity for more than two years. An online newspaper reported that a close source to the insurgents broke the news of Leah’s motherhood to them. A journalist, Ahmed Salkida, who claimed to have close professional confidential ties with the insurgents, also confirmed on his twitter handle yesterday that Leah had become a mother but he was not sure of the baby’s gender. His tweet reads: Ahmad Salkida @A_Salkida: “Why, I wonder, do we pretend that leaving Leah behind won’t result in pregnancy? Since the terror group announced condemning her to slavery, is there any step or collective focus on preventing similar occurrences? She’s a mother, but I don’t know about the gender of the baby.” Mr. Sahribu, who confirmed reading the report online, said: “I don’t have to say anything again. We have left whatever is happening to Leah in the hands of the Almighty God. Before, they told us she was dead. Now, they are saying she has a baby. So, we don’t have anything to say. Let God do His will in her life.”
