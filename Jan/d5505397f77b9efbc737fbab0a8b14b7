From Franca Ochigbo and Joseph Iorakosu, Abuja  The Nigerian National Entrepreneurship forum, NEF in partnership with Federation of Agricultural Commodity Association of Nigeria (FACAN), have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to access the $5billion made available by the Chinese government for  entrepreneurs in the country. The President, NEF, Sidney Inegbedion, disclosed this on Thursday at the signing of a  Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on how the $5billion will be disbursed in both sectors of the economy. Inegbedion said both organisations are already working with the Chinese government through the Central Bank of Nigeria to make the fund available for assessment. These will include initiatives which has started with the German and United State government, which will all be included in the project for sponsorship.  FACAN has over 49 association groups representing strategic sector of the agriculture value chain, sesame seeds, share butter, cassava etc. The signing of the MOU, Inegbedion explained, is important to Nigerian Entrepreneur forum because it gives the country the opportunity to be able to expand the horizon of the indegenous farmers and position them for the global market place. To attain this, he said it required training, funding, creation of market access, locally and internationally and also the deployment of mechanised equipment and modern infrastructure to the development of agriculture. ‘We have collectively decided as a nation that reliance on monoculture or the crude oil will not do us any good in the light of the global change. Agriculture remains constant. The coming together of Nigerian entrepreneur forum and FACAN is to to address thess issues,” he explained.
