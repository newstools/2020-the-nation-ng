Governor Umahi, while relaying his experience with the suspects, recently said “Some group of people in the past two months said they have $125 million to give us. I told my Commissioner for Finance that it doesn’t sound real. I know immediately that it was a scam but my commissioner for finance continued pushing innocently. “Because of his belief that it is real, I told him to go ahead. They said they were investors and that they have money to give to us free of charge. They said we should bring $125 million US dollars. And out of the money, they will only take $25 million dollars to develop our place while the remaining $100million US dollars will be our own. “I said what is my own. They can even take 50% if they want and give us even 1million dollars, since it is a grants. I told them that, if this money is a flush money, Ebonyi State Government will not be held responsible. The journey began.
