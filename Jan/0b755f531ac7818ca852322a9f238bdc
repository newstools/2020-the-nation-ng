 No fewer than five Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) clubs have contacted the erstwhile head coach of Enyimba, Usman Abd’Allah. Abd’Allah and  Enyimba parted ways on Monday after the People’s Elephant were thrashed  4-0 by  Plateau United in Jos.  But source close to the Kano State-born  coach informed NationSport that  a horde of NPFL clubs have indicated interest  with a view to employing him. Though  the identity of the NPFL  clubs are being kept under wraps,  Abd’Allah has not opened up communication channels with any of them insisting that he would like to take a few days of rest to clear his head following his departure from  Enyimba. “Coach has over five clubs that have shown serious interest to engage his services,” the source explained in an interview. “But he  told all of them that he  was not ready to have any formal discussion with any of them for now. He said he just want to rest from what he experienced at Enyimba which he has put behind him. “He said he could consider a return to the dugout by the mid-season if he has had enough rest but that he is not willing to jump into a decision he would later regret.” As at the time of leaving Enyimba, Abd’Allah left the reigning league Champions in 13th  spot with 15 points from 10 games with two outstanding games at hand against MFM (away) and Wikki Tourists (home). The People’s Elephant are also still finely placed to qualify for the next stage of the CAF Confederation Cup where they are currently third behind Hassania Agadir (Morocco), Paradou(Algeria) and they host the latter this weekend in the MatchDay Four of the African second tier club competition.
