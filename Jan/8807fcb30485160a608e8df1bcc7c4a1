The Honda Place has held a three-day Mega road show, the first of its kind in Lagos, where a convoy of Honda Sport Utility Vehicles (SUVs) painted the town red with its promotional offer and engaging with the fellow roadsters for a test drive. The road show started with a bang to create a buzz around the new Honda HR-V. The timing coincided with December festivities. The convoy of six cars started at The Honda Place in Akin Adesola, Victoria Island with fan fair and covered strategic locations like Falomo round about, Ikoyi, Lekki Admiralty Road, Third Main land, Opebi, GRA, Ajose Adegun, Oniru and Lekki Express Way among others to engage with the customers. The New Honda HR- V is a perky crossover with available all-wheel drive and a rear seat that flips and folds to please owners. The Honda HR-V stuffs a lot of personality into its 102.8-inch wheelbase. Its body riffs on hatchbacks and crossovers with sweeping strakes that run from the nose to the rear roof pillars. The cabin has the tone right, and wears tough-looking clothes that clearly are meant to last. It has spacious interiors, easy handling, and great fuel economy. The road show managed to create visibility and prompt test drives. The super enthusiastic Honda promoters connected with more than 3000 customers. Flyers were shared and the hype had motorists in traffic checking out the cars while music was playing.
