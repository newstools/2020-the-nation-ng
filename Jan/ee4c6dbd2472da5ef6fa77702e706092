The dispute between management and employees of Chevron Nigeria Limited (CNL), over poor welfare and unwarranted workers sack has worsened. Chevron employees under the aegis of Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN), Chevron branch, yesterday staged protest at the company’s head office in Lekki, Lagos State. The protest came on the heels of several days of shutting down offices by the protesting employees. According to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), the protest began early in the day with the aggrieved workers holding placards and chanting solidarity songs. The report stated that although the workers refused to speak they were, however, carrying placards with various inscriptions including such as “Stop Sacking Nigerians” and “Reduce Expats Allowances.” The General Manager, Policy, Government and Public Affairs, Chevron Nigeria Limited (CNL), Mr. Esimaje Brikinn,  in an e-mail to NAN, said the striking workers also prevented other employees who were not members of PENGASSAN from gaining access to the offices. He added that CNL branch of PENGASSAN had on December 17 last year began a unilateral industrial action and directed its members to stay away from their offices, citing some industrial relations issues as the reason for their action. Brikinn said: “CNL, in keeping with its commitment to resolving issues through meaningful dialogue and respect for the rule of law, is engaging in discussions with the union to understand and seek amicable resolution of the issues. “CNL is a responsible and law-abiding company. The company’s highest priority remains the welfare and safety of its employees, contractors and the security of its assets. We will, therefore, do our best to safeguard these interests.”
