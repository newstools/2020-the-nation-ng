The Ikoyi Club Tennis session is ‘serving off’ the year with a double Tennis Championship which enters crucial stages today at the elite club. The tournament which started on Monday is being sponsored by ARM Pensions with the Men’s Doubles, Ladies Doubles and Veteran Doubles events to be competed for. Already, club members are excited with the take-off of activities after experiencing a loaded 2019, which witnessed many tournaments and ended with an international tournament in Accra, Ghana. Chairman of the Tennis section, Bimbo Okubena, said he was particular happy that ARM Pensions has joined the list of sponsors of tennis at the club, expressing optimism that many more tournaments would be staged this year at the club. Okubena said: “This is just the first event of this year and we have many others coming up. Some are annual events while some new ones will also be staged. We thank the management of ARM Pensions and we believe it is the beginning of a good relationship. I am also glad that the turnout of members was huge for the on-going event. I am positive that this year’s events will be bigger and better than 2019 tournaments.” In the double pairings released, Lasore Olayemi and Ezomo Imokuedo will square up against  the pair of Hilary Eledu and Ishmeal Nwaokocha while the Managing Director of ARM Pension, Wale Odutola will also feature just as Okubena will also vie for honours. According to one of the tournament officials, a total of 60 smashers are taking part in the on-going ARM Pensions tournament which ends on Friday January 31.
