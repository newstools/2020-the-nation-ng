 THE Kano State High Court presided over by Justice Hadiza Suleiman on Thursday remanded Bashir Kashim and Mustapha Saleh at a Correctional Service Centre for alleged Internet fraud. The duo were arraigned by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on a two-count charge contrary to Section 7(1)(a) of the Advance Fee Fraud and Other Fraud Related Offences Act 2006. The defendants, who were alleged to be members of a syndicate of Internet fraudsters operating at 282, H/C Hotoro Area Quarters, Kano, were accused of duping the public of their hard-earned money. The defendants, who claimed to be students, were accused of living above their income, driving posh cars and living an ostentatious lifestyle under the guise of being bureau de change operators. The defendants pleaded not guilty. Prosecuting counsel Michael Ojo asked the court for a date for the beginning of the trial. The defence counsel, M. M. Sani, prayed the court to hear their motion for bail application, but the judge said: “I can’t attend to it today.” Justice Suleiman remanded the defendants at the Correctional Service Centre and adjourned the matter till January 28.
