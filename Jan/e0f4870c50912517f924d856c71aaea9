WHENEVER actor Taiwo Hassan, better known as Ogogo, remembers his 60th birthday celebration, he will always remember Senator Olamilekan Adeola, popularly called Yayi. To the surprise of Ogogo and guests at a colourful birthday reception at Yard 158, Oregun, Lagos, On December 15, the Lagos East Senator gifted the veteran actor a Toyota Venza SUV. Describing Ogogo as a good man who had done so much in Nollywood, he said he deserved to be celebrated in a big way. Yayo stated: “Ogogo is well celebrated all over the world. He has done so much and he deserves to be recognised, especially for what he has done for the theatre art in this country. He can go out of his way to do anything for anybody, most especially when he believes in what the person is doing. This is just the beginning of good things to come and to happen to Ogogo. I am here to appreciate him. I thank God for his life…”
