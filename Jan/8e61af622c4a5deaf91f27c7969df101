Mr. Loxley stated that, being a premium and internationally branded 4-star hotel within the Lagos business community, it is imperative to consistently deliver excellent services that would drive for renewed customer patronage, guest referral and loyalty. Such experience is one not alien to Southern Sun Ikoyi and has earned it accolades and recognitions from premium travel and hospitality sites, local industry award platforms and renowned guests in its over ten years of operation. “At Southern Sun Ikoyi, we spare no expense in getting the best resources available in upgrading our guestrooms, meeting and boardrooms, WiFi infrastructure, security surveillance amongst other resources in consistently improving our services and ensuring that our esteemed guests have a complete hospitality experience within a soothing ambience. This will further heighten their nostalgia for repeated visits of the signature services received exclusively at the hotel compared to none.” Mark concluded.
