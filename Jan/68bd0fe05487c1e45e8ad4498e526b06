The House of Representatives has condemned the killing of an air force personnel during a recent attack on troops of the 271 Nigerian Air-force detachment, Birnin Gwari, by armed bandits at Ungwan Yako along Kaduna-Birnin Gwari Road. Chairman of the Committee on Airforce, Shehu Koko Mohammad, said in a statement in Abuja that the barbaric attack was targeted at innocent citizens in the community who were saved by the gallant effort of the Air Force personnel. He said “On behalf of the speaker and members of the House of Representatives, members of the committee on Air-force want to use this medium to condemn the attack on troops of the Air-force and also commiserate with the force, the family of the fallen hero who died at the battle field. This is sad news for us and to Nigeria as a whole as we look forward to quick recovery for personnel who sustained several degree of injury.” The Air-force through its spokesman, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, had on Friday disclosed that ” the troops were able to disperse the over 70 bandits who had laid an ambush, killing several in the process. Unfortunately, one NAF personnel paid the supreme price in the process while some sustained varying degrees of injury. I want to assure the Chief of Air-force that the committee under my leadership will continue to pledge our parliamentary support to see that the force and other sister agencies are properly funded to enable them discharge their duties. “I also want to urge the force to see their commitment as a duty to their fatherland and redouble effort in the fight terrorism. Let me on behalf of the committee commiserate especially with the family of the fallen hero and all officers, airmen and women as well as civilian staff of the NAF. We pray Allah grant Aircraftman Mukhtar Ibrahim eternal rest.”
