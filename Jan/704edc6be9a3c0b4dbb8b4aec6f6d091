There was a mild drama on Wednesday at Ijare town in Ifedore Local Government Area of Ondo State as community chiefs led the youths to chase herdsmen who have been causing problems for the community. The herdsmen left their cows and ran away. A source said the incident happened after the herdsmen were warned to leave town since their cows always destroy farms. It was gathered that the herdsmen refused to leave but went further into the forest, a development community leaders were not comfortable with. Wednesday morning, the youths traced the herdsmen but on sighting them, the herdsmen abandoned their herd and fled. The cows, about 100, were led to the palace of Olujare of Ijare, Oba Oluwagbemigun Kokotiri. A source said: “These herdsmen have been adamant and it was high time they left. We didn’t harm them but we were surprised the way they ran away like being chased by a lion. They have been destroying our farms and we could no longer condone such losses again. We don’t have problem with them but we don’t want them and their cows in Ijare anymore.” A thunderstorm killed many cows in Ijare last year on the hill top.
