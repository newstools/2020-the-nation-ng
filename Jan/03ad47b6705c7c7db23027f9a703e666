By Chris Njoku, Owerri  47-year-old Sunday Agwim from Umuobom in Ideato South Local Government Area of Imo State is in police net for killing his 62-year-old mother Christiana Agwim with a hammer. Agwin was reportedly arrested over the weekend for killing his mother using machete to severe her head before smashing the skull with a hammer. Jude Mbionwu, a security coordinator at Umuobom, disclosed that the suspect completely broke the victim’s skull into pieces with a hammer with tissue of the brain littering the floor.  “When we get to the suspect’s house we saw him with a hammer and machete which he used first to cut off the head of the victim and then used the hammer to break the skull into pieces beyond recognition,” he stressed. It was gathered that the corpse of the deceased could not be taken to mortuary because of the degree of damage done to the head as coroners were called from the University Teaching Hospital Nnewi to conduct the autopsy to enable the family bury the deceased immediately. In his confessional statement, the suspect stated that he never knew what came upon him to commit such crime. “It is the devil because I did not know what came upon to kill my mother,” he told investigators. The Police Public Relations Officer, SP Orlando Ikeokwu confirmed the incident.
