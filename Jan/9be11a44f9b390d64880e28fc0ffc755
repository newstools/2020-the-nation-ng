 A few weeks after boasting that Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq has crossed the lines over the demolition of Ile Arugbo (an inherited political sanctuary) of the late strongman of Kwara Politics, Dr. Olusola Saraki, there is suspense from ex-Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, on the sudden ceasefire. On Monday, the family of Saraki  sought an out-of-court-settlement with the Kwara State Government.  In a January 20, 2020 letter to the Attorney-General of the state, Salman Jawondo, counsel for Asa Investment, A.A Ibraheem & Co, informed the state government of the family’s readiness for an amicable settlement. The letter reads in part: “Pursuant to the advice and directive of the court on the above matter, that parties should explore settlement, our client has directed us to notify you of its disposition to explore settlement with a view to resolving the outstanding dispute between the parties in respect of the subject matter in contention. “Consequently, we hereby request that you should use your good office to, as the Chief Law Officer of the state, make the necessary arrangement as to the time and venue where parties can meet and discuss.” Although it claimed it heeded to an advice by the judge handling the case, there appeared to be more than meet the eyes. Nigerians want Bukola Saraki  to be more forthcoming on why it sheathed the sword without a legal fight. Could it be that the C of O of Ile Arugbo is missing? Was it true that there was no shred of evidence tendered in the court by the family on the allocation of the disputed land? Could Bukola Saraki have been careless without perfecting the title deeds of the land for eight years as a governor?
