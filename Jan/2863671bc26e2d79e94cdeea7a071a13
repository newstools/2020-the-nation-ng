From Abdulrasheed Hammad  A Student of Usmanu Danfodiyo University, Sokoto (UDUS) Hauwa Abubakar Kana, who was kidnapped some days ago on her way  to school has been released by the abductors together with the other victims. Kana, a 300-Level student of Veterinary Medicine, was kidnapped on January 19. He was later released after his abductors collected an undisclosed amount as ransom, family sources told CAMPUSLIFE. Sources informed CAMPUSLIFE that Kana, alongside her co-passengers were attacked with weapons and thereafter kidnapped on the road between Maraba-Nassarawa. Speaking with our correspondent, the victim Kana, narrated her ordeal to Campus Life, stating that the kidnappers blocked the road to kidnap her and the other passengers for a huge ransom. “We were attacked between Maraba-Nasarawa and they blocked the road, the next thing we heard was gunshots. “We spent four days in the custody of these kidnappers, we were brutally beaten by these hoodlums who demanded N10million from us all.  “But I don’t really know the amount of money that was later given to them. Everybody paid the ransom before being freed. We all paid the ransom at the same time and all of us were released. I can’t even explain how I feel,” she said said. A friend of the victim Amira Hussaini Zange, equally expressed her sadness over the incident. “I was heartbroken,” said the 400-Level Botany undergraduate of UDUS. “I felt sorry for her and myself because she is a very close friend of mine. But thank God that friends and families really helped out with prayers and financial support. May Allah rewards everyone abundantly.” Kabeer Shuaibu Kana, a cousin to the victim, expressed his dissatisfaction over the incident and prayed that God should safeguard our movement in this country.
