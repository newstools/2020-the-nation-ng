 The Ondo State Police Command has debunked reports that it detained Prophet Samuel Afolabi aka Olopa to di Woli. It urged the people to disregard such. Prophet Afolabi oversees the Christ Apostolic Church (CAC, New Jerusalem) on Ondo Road, Akure. Spokesman Femi Joseph said Ayetare Sunday (35), a native of Itepe-Okitipupa, was arrested for impersonating Prophet Afolabi. Joseph said Ayetare has been remanded and charged to court for peddling fake miracles, attempted rape and sexual harassment. He said: “The Ondo State Police Command wishes to debunk the claims that a Prophet Samuel Afolabi aka Olopa to di Woli was arrested and detained. We insist that the cleric was never arrested for any offence as being peddled. “However, to set the record straight, a particular Ayetare Sunday (35), who went for a crusade at a church in Igbokoda, was arrested on December 27, 2019, for attempted rape and sexual harassment. The man confessed to be a fake prophet who had been deceiving people by organising fake miracles. He said he decided to adopt Olopa to di Woli to hoodwink people and get enough followers. He has since been charged to court and currently remanded in Okitipupa Correctional Service Centre. Prophet Afolabi, who addressed reporters yesterday, described the reports as sheer wickedness. He said his church is government approved.
