THE Chairman of the newly appointed tax collector in Apapa Local Government, Prince Adewale Adekunle, has urged residents and business owners to pay their rates and levies regularly. This, he said, would enable the government to serve them better by providing more basic amenities. Adekunle, who spoke during an enumeration tour of the council area by workers and management of Travtrain Consulting, said while the Adele Elijah Owolabi administration was committed to the provision of dividends of democracy to the residents, the people must reciprocate by paying their rates and levies into the governmentâ€™s coffers. He advised residents not to pay cash to anybody, but to only the designated bank account of the council for probity and accountability.
