  ELEVEN Local Government Areas will be under close watch as community transmission of coronavirus spreads, the Presidential Taskforce on COVID-19 said on Monday. It said it would focus local interventions on the 11 high burden councils. The councils were selected based on the number of infections, weekly percentage rise in cases, and percentage of positive tests. PTF National Coordinator, Dr Sani Aliyu, said: “If you do a COVID-19 test in a state, some have a positivity rate of 40 to 50 per cent. That means that you are under-testing. “Ideally, if the percentage of positivity is less than 10 per cent, it means you are testing adequately. “When we look at these figures, we combine the three criteria to come up with a number of local government areas that fulfil the requirements. “At the moment, we have identified 11 local government areas across the country, which we will start working on first. We expect this to change over time as the numbers change. “New local government areas will be added and hopefully others will be dropped along the way. “That is the strategy we are applying in terms of local interventions.”
