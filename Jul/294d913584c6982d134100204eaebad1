Two top chieftains of the All Progressives Congress(APC) in Akwa Ibom State, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe and Umana Okon Umana have denied any rift between them. Akpanudoedehe, a former Minister of state in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), is secretary to the National Caretaker Committee of the ruling APC. Umana, the 2015 governor candidate of the APC, is the Managing Director of the Oil and Gas Free Zones Authority(OGFTZA). Akpanudoedehe and Umana were responding to a report in one of the state-based newspaper, which suggested they were in contention over the 2023 governorship election in the state. In statement jointly signed by their media aides, Ata Etuk for Akpanudoedehe and Iboro Otongaran for Umana, they dismissed the sponsored report of purported rift between them as the handiwork of mischief makers bent on causing disaffection with the APC in Akwa Ibom. “The false report in the Uyo-based tabloid which has been publishing a series of fictitious stories about well-placed people in the state. “Senator Akpanudoedehe and Mr Umana wouldn’t have bothered to comment on the baseless and political-vendetta report but they have to just to make sure that unwary members of the public are not misled by a fictitious publication in a pay-to-play paper. “They have therefore advised members of the public to discountenance the said report which they characterize as “completely false and malicious in its entirety.”
