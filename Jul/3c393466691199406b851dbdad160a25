Eleven All Progressives Congress (APC) Governorship aspirants on Friday sent a formal letter to the party’s Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary National Convention Planning Committee (CEONCPC) rejecting the indirect mode of primary election on July 20. Only Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, who is seeking re-election, did not append his signature on the formal letter submitted to the office of the National Chairman of the party in Abuja. The letter dated 8th July, 2020, titled: “Why indirect primary cannot be an option for Ondo State Governorship Primary Election,” was submitted by Chief Olusola Oke, one of the aspirants on behalf of others at the National Chairman’s office at about 3:15pm.
