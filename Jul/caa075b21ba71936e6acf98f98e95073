FRANK Okamigbo was a popular nightlife celebrity for several years before he decided to refocus after a decade in the business. Popularly referred to as Frank Papas, the upwardly mobile graduate of the University of Lagos rose to national recognition as a stakeholder in the nightclub business. His last gig was The Place nightclub by Papas in Lekki â€“ a nightclub he ran in partnership with the management of The Place. Frank has since refocused to concentrate his energy on real estate. He has been transacting business with the name Papas Properties but embraced a low profile. Recently, a source hinted that the real estate arm of his business has been the focus while his eyes are still very much on the ball regarding the nightlife business. He is equally said to be working on a project which he intends to use in relaunching himself in the nightlife business.
