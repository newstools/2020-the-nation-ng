 THE People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has given eight governorship aspirants the nod to contest for its ticket at the primary. Certified contenders are Deputy Governor Agboola Alfred Ajayi, Ayorinde Bode, Ebiseni Sola, Eyitayo Jegede, Kunlere Boluwaji, Okunomo Banji Ben, Olafeso Eddy and Godday Erewa. About 2,500 delegates are expected to participate at the primaries. Last weekend, some PDP members protested at the Heritage Hotel in Akure after they got hint that some party leaders planned to change the list of delegates in favour of the deputy governor. The protesters alleged that there were attempts to replace names of the elected wards and local governments’ delegates across the state. They accused the acting state Chairman, Clement Faboyede, of working in connivance with Ajayi to change the list. But, Ondo PDP spokesman Zadok Akintoye, who confirmed the protest, said he was not aware of any bribery allegations. He said: “I didn’t see the deputy governor at the event, but I saw three other aspirants and I know the party will react at an appropriate time.” Chief Press Secretary to the Deputy Governor, Babatope Okeowo, described the allegation as laughable, false and an attempt to blackmail members of the committee, who were in the state for the compilation of the ad hoc delegates’ list for the primary.
