 KWARA State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq has said the state’s agricultural master plan will soon be ready. He added that his administration is putting final touches to the document. “Revamping Kwara’s economy through agricultural development is one of my campaign promises and I am glad that we are taking steps and laying foundation for this with the Kwara State Agricultural Master Plan,” the governor said during a virtual meeting with the team working on the document. He added: “I have just had a robust engagement with government stakeholders and the team reviewing the Kwara State Agricultural Master Plan – an inclusive and holistic roadmap that will set Kwara on the path of economic prosperity. “This master plan is unique because it reflects the interests of players in the agric subsector in Kwara, ranging from farmers’ cooperatives to agro-allied industries, livestock farmers’ groups and unions, regulators and financial institutions, etc.” AbdulRazaq said the document evolved from a robust data gathering process, which saw the government team consulting with stakeholders. Former Governor Cornelius Adebayo has lost his daughter. The deceased, Diekola Osa-Avielele, 44, reportedly died last Thursday from child-birth complications. Governor AbdulRazaq has commiserated with Chief Adebayo over the loss. A statement by AbdulRazaq’s spokesman Rafiu Ajakaye said: “The governor shares in the pain and quiet moment of former Governor Adebayo and his family over the loss of his daughter. On behalf of his family, government and people of Kwara State, the governor commiserates with the Adebayos and urges them to take solace in the Good Lord at this time and always. “The governor prays the Almighty to grant Diekola eternal rest and give the family the fortitude to bear the loss.”
