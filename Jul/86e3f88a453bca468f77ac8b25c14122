President Muhammadu Buhari has advised Nigerians, especially Muslims, to observe this year’s Eid El-Kabir celebration with caution, heeding protective directives by state and local authorities. This was contained in a statement issued by the Presidency on Wednesday. It said the President would observe the celebration privately with his family, adding that the usual Sallah homage and visitation would not be entertained. The statement, signed by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, said the President decided to stay away from the usual loud celebration in obedience to the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic protocols and to help stop the spread of the disease. “President Buhari will observe the Eid El-Kabir prayers with his family at home, just as he did during the Eid El-Fitr a little over two months ago, in line with advisories from the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA) and the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19. “In wishing Muslims a safe and happy Eid, the President reiterated the protocols as issued by the PTF that large gatherings, as much as possible, should be discouraged. “Where small groups choose to hold the Eid together, face masks are necessary, as is social distancing. Advisedly, such prayers should hold outdoors and worshippers are encouraged to bring their own prayer mats. “In order to stop the spread of the disease, the President will not be receiving Sallah homages by religious, community, party and government leaders and urges citizens to observe the occasion as advised by state and local authorities. “He once again wishes citizens a safe and happy Eid,” the statement said.
