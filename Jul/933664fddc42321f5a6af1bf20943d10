 Barcelona are reportedly trailing Juventus and Manchester City in the race to sign Wolves’ winger Adama Traore. According to ESPN, Barcelona’s hopes of re-signing former academy man Adama Traore have taken a dent as Juventus and Manchester City are currently leading the chase for the Wolves star. Traore came through the youth ranks at Barcelona’s famed La Masia academy. However, the lack of a clear pathway to the first-team saw the winger leave the Catalans in 2015, signing for Aston Villa. But, having failed to make an impact, the 24-year-old left for Middlesbrough in 2016. After two years with the Teessiders, Traore made the jump to Wolves in 2018, and he has thrived. While he had a decent enough debut season, the Spaniard has taken his game to a new level in the ongoing campaign. In 32 Premier League games this term, he has netted four goals and set up nine more.
