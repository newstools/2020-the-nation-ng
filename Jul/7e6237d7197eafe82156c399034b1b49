 The Fadairo Royal family of Owu-Abeokuta will tomorrow celebrate its Chairman, Pa Adebowale Fadairo, at Grailland Iju Hills, Lagos, where his body will be interred. Pa Fadairo, who would have been 78 on July 21, passed on last Saturday in Lagos after a brief illness. He was Head of Chemicals Marketing at the National Oil and Chemical Marketing Company (now Conoil PLC), a subsidiary of Shell Petroleum Development Company, where he retired in 1998 after 18 years of meritorious service in the oil sector. Pa Fadairo had previously worked as a Senior Marketing Executive at Berger Paints PLC, which he joined in 1977 after a stint at the Customs and Excise upon completing a Master’s degree in Chemistry at the Governors State University in Chicago, United States.  He was an adherent of the Grail Message and strove to live his life according to the Truth. The Fadairo Descendants’ Acting Chairman, Mr Kola Fadairo, said the departed chairman “loved all and sundry in the family and was always looking out for their good. We will miss him dearly.” Rev. Peter Kayode Omole, an old school mate of the deceased at Methodist Boys’ High School, Lagos, described his bosom friend of over 63 years as a mix between being rascally and gentle. The former General Secretary of the Fadairo Descendants, Mr. Muyiwa Akintunde, described Pa Fadairo as a leader in a million. He is survived by five children, nine grandchildren, brothers, sister, nieces, nephews and other relatives.
