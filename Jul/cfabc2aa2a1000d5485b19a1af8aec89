Succour has come the way of a Nigerian mother Suliyah Abdulkareem and her quadruplets, who have been stranded in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Mrs. Abdulkareem and her husband, Tijani, were making arrangements to return to Nigeria from the UAE before she went into premature labour and had the babies via an emergency C-section at the Latifah Women and Children Hospital in Dubai. The couple, who live in Dubai, began making plans to relocate his wife to Nigeria to give birth when they found she was having quadruplets in January. They had hoped that the travel restrictions triggered by Coronavirus (COVID-19) would ease ahead of her planned departure in May, a few months before her August delivery date. Suliyah, 29, gave birth to the babies – two boys and two girls – on July 1. But, the parents of four have got a lifeline from the Crown Prince of Dubai after he pledged to cover their medical fees. Those fees have now been covered by Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed, leaving the family overjoyed.
