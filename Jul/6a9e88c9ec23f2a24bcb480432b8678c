Ebonyi Deputy Governor Kelechi Igwe has said Governor David Umahi is currently not showing COVID-19 symptoms and is conducting official duties from isolation. Igwe said this on Tuesday at a meeting with top government officials and the state COVID-19 Response Team in Abakaliki. He declared that the governor “is still very strong”. Umahi on July 4 announced that he and some of his aides had tested positive to the virus. He then said they would isolate in adherence to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) protocols. The deputy governor said the development had shown Umahi’s level of passion and love for the state, adding that the government would use prayers to “speed-up” his recovery process. “We have directed all Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to immediately commence one-hour daily prayer session for the governor’s recovery, including others infected with the disease in the state,” the deputy governor said. Igwe noted that the government would not abdicate on the fight against the virus because of the governor’s ‘temporary isolation’, saying that the fight’s sustenance would help him recover quicker. Ebonyi House of Assembly Speaker Francis Nwifuru described the disease as ‘operating in mysterious ways’, which confound both the leaders and the led. Commissioner for Health Dr. Daniel Umezurike said the meeting was timely because the COVID-19 challenge was enormous and needed steady review of strategies to fight it. He said the death toll of COVID-19 patients in the state have risen to six out of the 508 persons, who tested positive to the virus. He noted that of the 508, who tested positive to the virus, 426 patients have been treated and discharged.
