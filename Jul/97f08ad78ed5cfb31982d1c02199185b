The Ministry of Youth and Sports Development, Mr Sunday Dare, in collaboration with actors, has invited young Nigerians to participate in a 60-Day App Development Challenge aimed at empowering them with skill set in mobile application design. This is in a bid to mitigate the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic on small businesses. In a statement issued by its Media Office, the Ministry said app developers interested in the project should be inspired by the desire to get their fellow Nigerians connecting seamlessly and safely with each other, and conducting their businesses even as the pandemic is still an ongoing concern. The statement said the App submissions must solve a problem within the following fields: edu-tech, agri-tech, sport, health, fin-tech and telecommunications. “Through this competition, we hope to see a slew of highly innovative and easy-to-use apps, which can be used to improve a range of processes and increase the ease of accessibility to services available to the citizenry,” the statement said. The best set of applications will attract multi-million naira prizes and training to further develop the applications.
