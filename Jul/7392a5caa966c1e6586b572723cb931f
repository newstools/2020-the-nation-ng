 Nigerian equities reopened yesterday with a tight mix of bargain-hunting and sell pressure as investors sought to reevaluate their portfolios ahead of the release of the half-year results of quoted companies. With 12 advancers to 13 decliners, the market was almost on a tit-for-tat pattern with decline in the banking and industrial goods sectors counterbalanced by gains in the insurance and oil and gas sectors. Benchmark indices at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) indicated average decline of 0.07 per cent, equivalent to net capital depreciation of N10 billion. Average year-to-date return thus worsened to 9.6 per cent, with 0.9 per cent lost so far this month. The All Share Index (ASI)- the common value-based index that tracks share prices at the Exchange (NSE) declined from its opening index of 24,287.66 points to close at 24,269.58 points. Aggregate market value of all quoted equities also dropped from its opening value of N12.670 trillion to close at N12.660 trillion. Sectoral indices showed mixed performance, underlining the tight market situation yesterday. The NSE Insurance Index appreciated by 0.4 per cent. The NSE Oil & Gas Index inched up by 0.3 per cent while the NSE Consumer Goods Index closed flat. However, the NSE Banking Index declined by 0.5 per cent while the NSE Industrial Goods Index slipped by 0.01 per cent. The momentum of activities, however, improved as total turnover volume and value increased by 90.1 per cent and 42.6 per cent to 305.1 million shares valued at N2.1 billion. Sovereign Trust Assurance was the most active stock with a turnover of 75.56 million shares worth N15.11 million. United Bank for Africa (UBA) trailed with a turnover of 70.71 million shares worth N441.89 million while Guaranty Trust Bank placed third with 36.97 million shares worth N795.13 million.
