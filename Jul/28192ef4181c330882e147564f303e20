Inspector General of Police Mohammed Adamu has disowned a viral video in which a man in policeman uniform is seen stamping on the neck of a man lying on the floor. The video was credited to @NigeriaDream. In a statement by Force spokesman DCP Frank Mba on Monday, Adamu said the video was not shot in Nigeria. “In the video, the security officer was seen stamping…on the neck and head of a man lying helplessly on the floor. “The Force condemns the act. It has painstakingly fact-checked and examined the video and hereby states that the incident did not take place anywhere or at any time in Nigeria,” the statement said.
