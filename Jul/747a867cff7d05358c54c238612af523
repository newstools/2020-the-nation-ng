 GOVERNOR Godwin Obaseki has reacted to the resignation of three commissioners in the Edo State Oil and Gas Producing Areas Development Commission (EDSOGPADEC). Reacting through his Special Adviser on Media and Communication Strategy, Crusoe Osagie, the governor said the resigned board members of EDSOGPADEC were not members of the Executive Council (EXCO). He said: “This clarification has become necessary to correct the erroneous impression in the public domain that members of EDSOGPADEC, an agency of the Edo State Government, are members of the Executive Council. Board members are civil commissioners of the government. “Although these board members are sometimes referred to as commissioners, a title they share with their counterparts on the board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), they are, however, not civil commissioners of the state government that assist with the day-to-day running of the government.” The commissioners who resigned were Osamwonyi Atu, Emmanuel Odigie and Rilwanu Oshiomhole, who represented Edo South, Edo Central and Edo North senatorial districts on the board of the commission. In their resignation letters dated July 27, the three persons gave reasons for resigning. Atu from Orhinonmwon in Edo South gave family reason for his resignation, saying: “I need to resign to take care of compelling family issues that need my attention.” Odigie said as a loyal party man, he needed to tender his resignation, adding: “Following due consideration and wide consultations, I have resolved to resign as a member representing Edo Central Senatorial District in EDSOGPADEC.
