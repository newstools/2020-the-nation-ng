By Rasaq Ibrahim,  Ado-Ekiti President Muhammadu Buhari has felicitated with a foremost scholar, educationist, poet and community leader, Chief Alexander Olu Ajayi, on his 90th birthday. In a congratulatory message signed by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, Buhari hailed Ajayi for serving the nation in different capacities. The President commended Ajayi, the ex-Registrar of University of Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University),  for his exemplary life devoted to sharing knowledge and contributing to the smooth running of educational institutions. He said Ajayi had no other motive but to impact on the education sector from 1953 when he took a degree at the Fourah Bay College, Sierra Leone, to post-graduate studies in University of London in 1954. “This saw him serving at great schools as tutor, and eventually becoming head teacher at Fiditi Grammar School, Oyo, at the tender age of 26. “Chief Ajayi joined the West African Examinations Council (WAEC) in 1959, and later the University of Ife, where he rose to become the deputy registrar,’’ he further said.
