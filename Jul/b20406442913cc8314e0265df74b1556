 The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) on Friday accused the opposition Peoples Democratic Party ( PDP) of embarking on its usual antics of diversionary, baseless and theatrical allegations ahead of the 19th September, 2020 Edo Governorship election. Reacting to PDP’s comments on the composition of APC National Campaign Council for Edo State Governorship election, the governing party in statement in Abuja on Friday by its Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Yekini Nabena, said the opposition was intimidated by the calibre of APC Campaign Council. Nabena said: “We understand the PDP is intimidated by the quality, depth and political sagacity of the APC National Campaign Council deployed by the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary National Convention Planning Committee to organise a formidable campaign structure to ensure success of the APC and our candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu during the election. “The APC has no interest in rolling in the mud with the PDP and engaging them in their senseless and drunken tirade. “Edo state is not dubbed the Heartbeat of the Nation for nothing. The Edo electorate is sensible, sophisticated and progressive. The focus of the APC is to display to the Edo electorate our pro-people credentials, infrastructure/development track record, social investments, wealth creation initiatives among others which is being replicated across APC states. “APC is a party that fiercely advocates, practices and defends the principle of “One person, one vote”. Come September 19 every valid vote must count”. The ruling party then urged the PDP to concentrate on their deadbeat and empty campaign instead of the comic it has turned itself to. Insisting that, “Edo is proudly an APC state”.
