The Federal Government yesterday insisted that the Third Mainland Bridge will be closed for six months for repairs, beginning from the midnight of July 24. Speaking at a news conference in Lagos, the Controller of Works, Federal Ministry of Works, Mr. Olukayode Popoola, said the bridge was last rehabilitated in 2012, which was about eight years ago, adding that there was need to carry out the repairs to avert collapse. He said the first three months would be used to carry out work on the part of the bridge coming from the Lagos Island to the Mainland, while work on the other portion of the bridge coming from Oworonsoki to Lagos Island would begin three months later. Popoola said the closure of the bridge, which shall be carried out in phases, is to carry out maintenance work. “We don’t want the bridge to collapse. We want to replace worn out components and joints.  “The bridge will be partially closed and there will be diversion of traffic from midnight to 1pm every morning for movement from Oworonsoki to Lagos Island only on the Lagos Island bound lane; while from 1pm to midnight, it will be Lagos Island to Oworonsoki traffic only on the Lagos Island bound lane. This will be in place for three months for the repairs of the Oworonsoki bound lane,” he said. Popoola said the second phase of the work would follow the same pattern and would be for another three months. “Motorists are advised to also ply the alternative routes of Carter Bridge through Iddo to Oyingbo to join Adekunle ramp inward Oworonsoki, or from Ijora through Western Avenue to Ikorodu Road,” he said.
