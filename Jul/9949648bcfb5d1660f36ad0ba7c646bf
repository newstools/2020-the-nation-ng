Cadbury Nigeria Plc has commended Mr. Atedo Peterside, its immediate past chairman, for his unwavering leadership through transformational change. Managing Director, Cadbury Nigeria Plc, Mrs. Oyeyimika Adeboye, said Peterside, who announced his resignation from the board of the company last week, contributed significantly to its growth. She said Peterside had been a great support to executive management, challenging and encouraging the team through the years. “Cadbury Nigeria has benefitted from Peterside’s wealth of experience. His inspiring leadership style and astute management skills have been of significant value to our company,” Mrs Adeboye said. She said the board, management and staff of Cadbury Nigeria appreciate the immense contributions of Peterside to the success of the company and wish him well in his future endeavours. Peterside has been a member of the Board of Directors of Cadbury Nigeria since August 5, 2009 and became chairman on April 21, 2010. He announced his resignation from the company on June 30, 2020, to move on to concentrate on other challenges. In a statement announcing his resignation, Peterside said Cadbury Nigeria has stabilised on a growth path, noting that the company had held its 55th Annual General Meeting (AGM) while its Managing Director has settled nicely and consolidated her position over  the last 15 months. “The company is on a profitability path that can be sustained if normal trading conditions are allowed to prevail. The board of Cadbury is well-endowed and my departure from the board also enables the company to inject a new independent director into the fold. The periodic injection of “new blood” is good for the system, especially when further diversity is achieved in the process viz geography, demography and the injection of new and varied skill sets,” Peterside stated.
