 GENERAL Overseer of the Synagogue Church of All Nations ((SCOAN) Pastor Temitope (TB) Joshua on Wednesday offered to virtually pray for COVID-19 patients in isolation centres around the world. In an announcement posted on Joshua’s YouTube channel, Emmanuel TV, the cleric called on relevant government and medical authorities to “organise those who are in isolation” and “arrange how to connect them to us on Emmanuel TV”. “The blessing of Jesus is for those who knock and ask,” he said in the announcement, adding: “In whatever way you support to make this happen, we are a team; we are not doing more than you.” “Together, we shall pray for them. Together we shall be set free from this COVID-19,” the statement continued, quoting the Biblical reference in Luke 4:40, where Jesus healed “all who had various kinds of sickness after the mass prayer”. “The same anointing that heals one is also able to heal all at the same time,” it added, calling on all interested parties to contact the church via their email address info@emmanuel.tv.” Last week, the World Health Organisation reacted to a trending video in which a Cameroonian medical doctor was ‘healed’ from COVID-19 after receiving “interactive prayer” from Joshua’s ministry, acknowledging “spiritual leadership is very important in a time like this”.
