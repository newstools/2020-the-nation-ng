IN honour of one of Africa’s great leaders, Balogun and Baba Adini of Yorubas in Ghana, Alhaji (Dr) Ahmed Vanderpuije has urged youths to embrace and aspire to the kind of peace legacy left behind by former South African President Nelson Mandela. Speaking at an event hosted by the International Association of Student for Youth and Peace in Ghana, Vanderpuije said to be focused on the youths is to genuinely focus on the truth. He said: “Our hope is for resetting our continent and peace-building for a better world. Peace is about the absence of all forms of discrimination from gender, race, ethnicity, and religious persuasion. Peace is about good and relevant education for our children and access to proper medical attention and health facilities. Peace is about justice, democracy, prosperity and the pursuit for happiness.” The IAYSP is a youth affiliate of the Universal Peace Federation (UPF) which was established as a youth-focused NGO to empower youths and students to become global citizens of peace through character education and peace projects through sustainable development goals.
