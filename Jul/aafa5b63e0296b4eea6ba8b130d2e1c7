On Wednesday, July 1, top Lagos lawyer, Dr. Wale Babalakin, joined the league of 60. Although he would have loved to celebrate the milestone age, he understood that it was not a season of hosting big parties. At 60, Babalakin is already living his dream. Apart from being an accomplished lawyer, he has built successful businesses too. A Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), he is chairman of Bi-Courtney Group of Companies and a recipient of the national honour of Officer of the Federal Republic (OFR) bestowed on him in 2007.
