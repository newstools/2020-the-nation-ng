Something is going on in Abia State and not a few people are wondering aloud. Prominent politicians across the divides are extending and accepting olive branches. But what many are eager to find out is the real motive behind these peace moves. Some are ascribing it to a looming crack in the ruling Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP). In fact, Sentry gathered all is no longer rosy between Governor Okezie Ikpeazu and some leading figures who helped him become governor in 2015. Some weeks ago, Chief Emeka Atuma who represented Ikwuano/Umuahia Federal Constituency (2003-2007) on the platform of PDP, joined the All Progressives Congress (APC). A few days later, another prominent politician, Chinedu Kanu, defected from the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) and berthed in APC. And while the dust raised by the defections were yet to settle, Speaker of the State House of Assembly and son of former governor, Theodore Orji, Chinedu Orji, visited the home another former governor, Orji Uzor Kalu and publicly urged him to “to take his rightful political position in the state.” The Speaker’s father and Kalu had been at loggerheads politically since 2007. Hardly had Orji left Kalu’s home before calls for his resignation as Speaker rent the air. And what’s more? The agitation was from his own party members in PDP who described the visit as anti-party activity. Responding to the calls for his resignation, Orji said he didn’t owe anybody explanations over his visit to the former governor. But the developments have only strengthened rumours of a crack within the ruling party, despite efforts by the Orjis and Ikpeazu to allay growing concerns among their supporters.
