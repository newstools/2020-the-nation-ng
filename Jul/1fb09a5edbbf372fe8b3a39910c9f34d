The Governor said the government will train the teachers and students on COVID-19 protocols before the schools resume adding that the teachers will also undergo COVID-19 tests. “Reopening of schools will start with cleaning of the schools, and every school we clean, we will fumigate it, and then do random test on the teachers. We will also deploy health workers to mount awareness within the communities where the school is situated”. “When school start we will have trained personnel to teach the children on Covid-19 protocols at least for the first one week. “This covid is real and we need to be very careful. It is not just to start school and all that, even if Nigerians should miss one academic year and stay alive,it worth it. The essence of everything we are doing is life, and we wouldn’t want our children to start school without proper awareness.”
