A court in Osun State on Tuesday sentenced a 37-year-old man, Ogunyemi Oluleke, to death by hanging for murder. Oluleke was charged with murder and conspiracy. Prosecutors said that Oluleke beheaded one Moshood Babalola with a machete in the Iredunmi area of Ile-Ife. The prosecution called five witnesses and tendered several exhibits to prove their case. One of the witnesses, Inspector Rasheedat Olanrewaju, told the court that she was among three policemen who went to the convict’s house for a search, adding that they saw a decomposed body in the convict’s house. She also said Oluleke confessed to killing “Moshood Babalola for rituals.” Justice Adedotun Onibokun found the Oluleke guilty and sentenced him to death by hanging.
