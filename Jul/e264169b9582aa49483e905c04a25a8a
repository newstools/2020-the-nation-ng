The planned opening of trial in the case against the immediate past Head of Service of the Federation (HOSF), Mrs. Winifred Oyo-Ita and nine others was stalled on Wednesday owing to the absence of the court’s stenographer. They were arraigned on March 23, 2020 before a Federal High Court in Abuja on an 18-count charge bordering on fraud, filed by the Economic and Fnanacial Crimes Commission (EFCC). Oyo-Ita is charged with her special assistant, Ubong Effiok; Frontline Ace Global Services Limited; Asanaya Projects Ltd; Garba Umar, his companies, Slopes International Ltd and Gooddeal Investments Ltd; U & U Global Services Ltd (allegedly owned by Effiok) and Prince Mega Logistics Ltd. At the mention of the case on Wednesday, prosecuting lawyer, Mohammed Abubakar said the business of the day was for the prosecution to open its case. Abubakar said he has two witnesses in court and was ready to proceed, subject to the court’s convenience. Although lawyers to the defendants said they were equally ready, Justice Taiwo Taiwo said the court cannot proceed with the case because the stenographer was not available. Justice Taiwo said he was not comfortable recording proceedings with his hand and would prefer the presence of the stenographer. The judge noted that since the case did not fall in the categories of those to be given special attention during the COVID-19 crisis, he would adjourn it to a later date. On the agreement of lawyers to all the parties, Justice Taiwo adjourned till October 20 this year. Oyo-Ita is accused of engaging in fraud in relation to Duty Tour Allowance, estacodes, conference fees and receiving kickbacks on contracts.
