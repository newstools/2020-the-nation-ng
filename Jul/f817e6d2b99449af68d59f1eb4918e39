The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) has issued a new certificate to Godwin Obaseki, governor of Edo State. The governor partook in the scheme in 1980 but there was an error on the certificate issued to him. An alphabet was missing in his surname which read Obasek instead of Obaseki. The All Progressives Congress (APC) panel which screened aspirants for the Edo 2020 primary election had cited this error as one of the reasons for disqualifying the governor from the race. He subsequently defected to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) where he contested and won the primary election. Before the PDP primary which held on June 25, Obaseki had written to the NYSC to demand rectification of the error and re-issuance of the certificate. In a letter dated June 19, 2020, a copy of which was seen by TheCable, Okonofua K N, who signed on behalf of the NYSC DG, said the corps had carried out an investigation and found that there is a need for reissuance of the certificate to reflect the correct name of the governor. “I refer to your letter referenced EOG/ABI/99/VOL IV/172 dated 18th June, 2020, on the above subject matter please,” the letter read. “I am directed to inform you that after investigation, the management of the National Youth Service Corps has approved that a new Certificate of National Service reflecting the Surname OBASEKI be produced as the earlier Certificate number 063107 dated 6th August, 1980 has been cancelled due to error in the surname i.e. OBASEK. “Accept the assurances of the Director-General’s regard.” Obaseki will face Osagie Ize-Iyamu in the September 19, 2020 election. He had defeated Ize-Iyamu, who ran on the PDP platform in 2016. The governor was elected under APC.
