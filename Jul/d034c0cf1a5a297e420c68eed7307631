The General Officer Commanding (GOC) 81 Division of the Nigerian Army (NA), Maj.-Gen. Godwin Umelo, has told operatives of the command to be ready for more work under his watch. Umelo stated this mid-week after taking over flagship of the division from his predecessor, Maj.Gen. Olu Irefin, who has been posted as GOC 6 Division, Port Harcourt. Umelo said he was well aware of the strides recorded by the division under his predecessor, and sought the personnel’s cooperation to surmount challenges that may arise. Umelo was at the Army Headquarters, Department of Army Training and Operations (DATOPs), Abuja, before his redeployment to 81 Division. In his brief remarks at the handing/taking over ceremony, Umelo said: “It is a privilege and honour to be appointed as the GOC 81 Division. I want to challenge everybody under my command to be ready to work harder. I am a workaholic and I would ensure that the standard does not go below what I have met.”
