The Media Campaign Council of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for Edo State’s governorship election has derided Godwin Obaseki of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as the governor of an empty Government House. It said he is on his way to an embarrassing defeat, noting that disgrace is awaiting him. The council, through its Chairman, Prince John Mayaki, said the resignations of Obaseki’s appointees and officials elected on APC’s platform, which it noted were expected to continue, were indications that the governor had been rejected by the people. The council said: “While the disheartened and dispirited image-makers of the outgoing Edo governor struggle to mend what is already a shredded image and at the same time console themselves with a meaningless exegesis on the technicalities of the office of those resigning from the Edo State Government in massive numbers, it is clear, beyond all doubts, to everyone within and outside the state that Obaseki has been rejected.”
