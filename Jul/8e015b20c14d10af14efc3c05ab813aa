Super Eagles forward Kelechi Iheanacho scored in his second consecutive game as the Foxes continued their push for a Champions League place next season Iheanacho scored his fifth goal of the season to help Leicester City defeat Crystal Palace 3-0 in Saturday’s Premier League game. Jamie Vardy’s hit a brace and his first took him to 100 Premier League goals as he became the 29th player to join that exclusive club since the competition was founded in 1992. Vardy also added a second during stoppage time of a 3-0 victory at the King Power Stadium. Despite joining an elite club, his focus was on securing Leicester’s first win since the restart.  “I am absolutely over the moon,” Vardy told Sky Sports afterwards. “First and foremost it was about the win today, getting back to basics and putting in a performance. “I am always frustrated if I miss a chance. You want to score as many as possible. But to score two goals and get the three points, that is all you can ask for. “I will wait until the end of the season before I can start reflecting on stuff.” Vardy’s achievement is all the more remarkable given that he did not make his Football League debut until the age of 25 and did not appear in the Premier League until he was 27.
