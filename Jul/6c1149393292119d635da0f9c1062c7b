 THE Christ Apostolic Church, Worldwide has disowned one Ogun State-based pastor Oluwafemi Oyebola, who was accused of impregnating his daughter three times and also caused her to undergo a medical procedure to prevent further conceptions. Oyebola was said to have been raping his daughter since 2015, when he lost his wife and terminated the pregnancies each they occurred. The girl eventually reported her ordeal to a non-governmental organisation, the Advocacy for Children and Vulnerable Persons Network, which took the matter to the police. The church has said Pastor Oyebola last worked with its Agbala Itura branch more than six years ago when he was suspended over issues of discipline. A statement issued by Director of Publicity, Pastor Ade Alawode, said, “Our investigation revealed that the said Pastor Oluwafemi Oyebola has not been reinstated into the Church’s services since his suspension in 2014, so, he is no longer a minister of the Church. “The Church where the incident took place in Owode Egba, is not among the assemblies registered with the authorities of the Church. He must have been presiding over the Church illegally,” the statement added.
