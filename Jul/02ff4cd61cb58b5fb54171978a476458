With Victor Osimhen almost concluded, talian Serie A side Napoli has reportedly shifted their focus on siging  a striking partner for the Nigerian with their eyes on Lazio’s Ciro Immobile. Napoli officials  are said to be in Sardinia to finalise Osimhen’s transfer from Lille which could cost as much as €81m. In the meantime, La Repubblica reports the Partenopei had also looked at Immobile. The hitman was born in Naples and his agent once said he could not turn down a move to his hometown club. However, Lazio owner Claudio Lotito was demanding no less than €50m for his No 9, which Aurelio De Laurentiis deemed too much for a player who turned 30 in February. Immobile is currently Capocannoniere in Serie A with 29 goals, but Osimhen is just 21 in comparison and ran out as Lille’s top scorer for 2019-20 with 13 strikes.
