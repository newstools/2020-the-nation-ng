 THE Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has threatened to discontinue the conduct of the Edo State governorship election if it perceives any form of violence. It warned parties and candidates participating in the September 19 poll not to contemplate breaching peace and order. INEC National Commissioner and Chairman Information and Voter Education Committee Festus Okoye said INEC would not take lightly any attempt to compromise the safety of its officials and other workers deployed for the election. “Politicians should not dare us. We will discontinue the process if we perceive any violence. Some of the people we mobilise for elections are workers in federal institutions as ad hoc staff and no organisation will mobilise people to go and be killed,” he said.
