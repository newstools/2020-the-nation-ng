The Osun State government has said the review of schools’ reclassification policy would be implemented when pupils resume across the state. The state noted that the review which has been approved earlier is targeted towards restoring the 6-3-3-4 classification system, thereby returning the state education system to its earlier class structure. This was revealed when a team from the Osun State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB), led by the Chairman, Israel Ajibola Famurewa, joined the concluding part of data gathering and physical assessment tour of the nine federal constituencies of the state by top government officials, held at Ijebu-Ijesha High School on Friday. Recall that the state government of Osun had approved the reversal of the single school uniform, ‘reclassification’ of the public school system and the restoration of conventional single-sex schools. The approval came after ‘some’ recommendations by a panel led by Olu Aina, which was set up to review education policies of the past administration, were considered by the state government. The implementation of the recommendations of the review panel has necessitated the data gathering and physical assessment of school for takeoff. The top officials of SUBEB who joined Famurewa in the tour include the Executive Secretary of SUBEB, Mr Adeoye Bakare, Commissioner (Technical), Chief Moshood Adekunle Oluawo, Commissioner (Services), Hon. Amos Akindiya, and other members of the board and directors. In his submission, Famurewa said “there is a need to fast track the process of implementing the review on the education policy so as to put necessary logistics in place before the schools resume. “Thus, this necessitated this tour across the nine federal constituencies of the state as it’s hoped to bring the desired result in no distant time for the benefit of our children and their teachers”.
