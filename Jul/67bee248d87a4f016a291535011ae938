 EMINENT journalist and former Lagos State Information and Strategy Commissioner Dele Alake on Sunday denied aspiring to become the senator for Lagos East. He warned those peddling the rumour about his ambition for the senatorial seat to desist. Alake berated a soft sell magazine behind the report for promoting fabrication, which he said was in bad faith. The former commissioner decried the publication’s regression to junk journalism, saying the report was embarrassing and breached the cardinal professional ethics of originality, objectivity and balance. According to him, the motivation for publishing what he called the tissue of lies should be further interrogated. Alake said a situation whereby a magazine concocted misleading and confusing reports that were laced with prevarications smacked of dishonesty, indiscipline and irresponsibility. He told The Nation on phone that he had not discussed any political aspiration with reporters. The Lagos East senatorial seat became vacant, following the death of Senator Adebayo Osinowo. Many All Progressives Congress (APC) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftains, particularly from Epe, Ikorodu, Kosofe and Ibeju-Lekki, have publicly declared their intentions to succeed him. Refuting the magazine’s story, Alake described it as false and a figment of the imagination of mischief makers. “It is a lie from the pit of hell. I have never indicated interest in the seat,” he said. Alake also said he had not discussed the matter with anybody, wondering where the magazine got its report from. He added: “It is junk journalism. The magazine broke the cardinal rule of journalism by not speaking with me to confirm what it heard or was told. This is highly unprofessional.”
