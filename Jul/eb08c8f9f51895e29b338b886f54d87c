A court in the Northern District of Illinois on Monday denied Ramon Abbas aka Ray Hushpuppi bail. The self-acclaimed ‘Billionaire Gucci Master’, who has over 2.5 million followers on Instagram, will remain in detention until his trial later this year over money laundering allegations, the court said. Hushpuppi will be transported to Los Angeles by the United States Marshals Service, and will not be allowed to stay with his girlfriend’s uncle in Homewood, Illinois. His trial is slated to hold in Los Angeles where the case was filed, rather from Chicago where the investigation is being handled, Forbes reports. Throughout the hearing, Hushpuppi’s lawyer denied that his client was a flight risk or a danger to the community, repeatedly rejecting the allegations made against his client by the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s affidavit posted earlier this month. The primary allegation levelled by the FBI is that Abbas was part of a network that made “hundreds of millions of dollars” from business email compromise frauds and other scams. Assistant United States Attorney Melody Wells, a prosecutor in the Chicago district attorney’s office, convinced the court that Abbas is a flight risk, describing his “significant” financial assets, “deep ties to foreign countries” and a lack of ties to the United States. Wells said Abbas had the “perfect recipe to flee the charges that he faces here.” Hushpuppi had sought to live with a girlfriend’s relative in Illinois but this was queried by the prosecutor, arguing that he had up to this point “never visited” the girlfriend or their child in the US. “There is no evidence that he has ever even met this ‘Uncle’ who would be the third-party custodian under these circumstances,” Wells said. The court ruled that there was “more than enough justification to order that the US Marshall bring Abbas to California as soon as possible to answer the complaint there.”
