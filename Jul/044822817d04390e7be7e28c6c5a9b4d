 FIGHTER jets have bombarded  bandits’ Kwiambana forest camps in Zamfara State, killing many of the outlaws, the military has said. The air raid followed intelligence report that the location was the hideout of Islamic State of West African Province ( ISWAP) fighters and bandits led by one Dogo Gede. A statement by the coordinator of Media Operations, Major-General John Enenche said, “the air component of Operation Hadarin Daji Aji has attacked another armed bandits’ camp in the Southwestern part of Kwiambana forest, neutralising scores of their fighters. “This was achieved through air strikes executed on 10 July 2020 after Human Intelligence (HUMINT) reports and series of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions established that a group of structures hidden under the dense forest vegetation served as hideouts for suspected Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) elements and fighters under the notorious armed bandit kingpin, Dogo Gede.” In Katsina and Sokoto states, troops also made gains in the fight against bandits, wiping out many of them in several places, and rescuing some abducted persons in Sokoto and Zamfara.
