 THE Lagos State government on Thursday rescued three trafficked children working at a construction site in Lekki. The state Materials Testing Laboratory (LSMTL) discovered the kids during an enforcement operation at construction sites in the area. The agency sealed off 22 high-rise buildings and four estates for non-compliance to quality assurance. LSMTL General Manager Dr Abiodun Afolabi warned developers against child labour, stating that defaulters would be prosecuted. According to him, the kids were from Benin Republic. ”It is child abuse; developers should not use children for construction. Look at the children, if we estimate, they are less than 10 years old. What will a 10-year-old be doing on a construction site?” he asked. Some of the trafficked children told journalists they were working as bricklayers and painters, adding that their daily wages of N400 per child were usually paid to their masters.
