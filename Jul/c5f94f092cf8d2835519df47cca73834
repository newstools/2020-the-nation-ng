 RIVERS State Governor Nyesom Wike has approved complete re-grassing and rehabilitation of the main bowl football pitch and the two training pitches of the Adokiye Amiesimaka Sports Complex. The stadium has hosted several local, continental and international matches in the past but the main bowl football pitch had been undulating and thus needed an overhaul that will involve excavation and laying of level planting of FIFA approved natural paspallum grass. The rehabilitation would also include the provision of motorized mower and lawn mowers, installation of sprinklers, laying of 6 underground pumping machines, plumbing and electrical works, amongst others. The move which is in preparation of the State-owned Rivers United towards their CAF Champions League campaign for the 2020/2021 season among other high profile matches. The project is expected to be handled by a renowned grass expert with core competence and track record in the provision, management and maintenance of sports facilities, is expected to be delivered towards the end of August. Rivers State Commissioner for Sports Boma Iyaye said  Governor Wike is leaving nothing to chance in ensuring that Rivers United has the best of facilities for the continental campaign. “I want to assure you that when the job is completed, it would be one of the best in Nigeria. Rivers State is known for excellence and you can be sure that this would be top notch to host any major football match,” he stressed.
