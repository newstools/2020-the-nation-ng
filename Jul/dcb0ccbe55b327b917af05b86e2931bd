Nigeria’s unbeaten heavyweight prospect Efe Ajagba has become the latest to join the growing stable of high-powered boxing manager James Prince. The news was announced by both parties through their respective social media platforms with the Houston-born businessman serving as manager to Floyd Mayweather Jr. during the early years of a career which would span five weight divisions. Prince has also managed the likes of former four-division champion Roy Jones Jr. and unbeaten former two-division champion Andre Ward—the latter whom currently co-manages rising unbeaten former featherweight titlist Shakur Stevenson. “Welcome to the J. Prince Boxing family, Efe Ajagba ” Prince revealed on his verified Instagram account. “The real Nigerian King he hits harder than [former heavyweight titlist Deontay] Wilder.” Prince tweeted. Prince will serve in more of an advisory capacity to Ajagba (13-0, 11KOs), who is currently managed by Shelly Finkel and promoted by Richard Schaefer’s Ringstar Promotions.
