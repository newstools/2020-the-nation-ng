Pep Guardiola will be handed about £150m to bolster his Manchester City squad after the quashing of the club’s two-year ban from European competition. On Monday, the court of arbitration for sport ruled that UEFA’s decision should be overturned and a 30m Euros (£27m) fine reduced to 10m Euros. This means Guardiola will be allowed to invest heavily, particularly in a rear-guard that proved the Achilles heel in this season’s failed title defence. The manager is prioritising a centre-back and left-back and may move for a striker because of Sergio Aguero’s potential departure next summer when the club record goal scorer’s contract is due to end. Bayern Munich’s David Alaba, who can play in both those defensive positions, is Guardiola’s prime target, and Kalidou Koulibaly, Napoli’s 29-year-old central defender, is also on his radar. The prospect of Guardiola being successful in the market is further boosted by the fine reduction, with £18m approximately equivalent to an elite player’s salary. Guardiola has previously stated that whatever CAS decided he would see out a contract that runs until summer 2021. Whether he will sign a deal to extend his tenure beyond a fifth year is unclear, although this will give City greater hope. Manchester City successfully overturned their two-year ban from European club competitions after CAS announced the club were cleared of “disguising equity funds as sponsorship contributions”.
