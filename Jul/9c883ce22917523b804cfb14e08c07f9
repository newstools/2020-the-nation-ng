Chairman of the Senate Committee on Constitution Review and Deputy Senate President Ovie Omo-Agege has said alterations will begin on the 1999 Constitution when the lawmakers return from this weekend’s Sallah break. Omo-Agege stated this on Wednesday when two groups – Women Education Advocacy and Development Initiative (WEADI) and League of Women Voters of Nigeria (NILOWV) – visited him in Abuja. He insisted that the Sexual Harassment Bill recently passed by the Senate was not targeted at lecturers in higher institutions but meant to flush out the few bad eggs tarnishing the image of their colleagues. The Delta Central senator regretted that few educators were soiling the image of their colleagues, majority of whom he described as “decent”. Omo-Agege hailed Senate President Ahmad Lawan for providing effective leadership while also applauding his colleagues for cosponsoring the Bill. He said: “This Bill is not targeted at our lecturers in tertiary institutions. To the extent that it is targeted at anybody, it is targeted at the errant few, the few predators in their midst. And we have them everywhere; not only in the tertiary institutions.”
