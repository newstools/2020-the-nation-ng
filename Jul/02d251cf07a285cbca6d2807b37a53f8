The Badagry Local Government of Lagos State is determined to plant not less than 2000 trees before the year runs out. The chairman of the local government, Hon Olusegun Onilude, made this known during this year’s tree planting exercise in the state tagged, “ Tree For Life,” which took place at Ajido township. The chairman, who was represented on the occasion by his Supervisor for Environment and Tourism, Hon Samson Nunayon Apata, said his administration was poised to reduce the effects of global warming and environmental challenges in the council area by making sure the people of Badagry and its environs embrace the culture of tree planting in their various communities instead of tree felling. He noted that there was the need to encourage residents to plant trees not only on the Tree Planting Day, but also during special occasions and festivals like naming, wedding, birthday, Christmas and Ileya festivals to commemorate such occasions. ”It will amaze you to see how many trees would be planted in the local government area within a year, if all of us planted a tree each in our environment during our special ceremonies and festivals. By this act, we would have succeeded in reducing the effects of global warming and other environmental challenges affecting our communities,“ he said. The council boss noted that his administration was determined to bring back the green environment the Badagry Local Government Area was noted for by the constant sensitisation of the residents on the effects of deforestation of the environment. Onilude urged the Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) in and outside the local government area to complement the efforts of the council  to plant valuable trees to beautify the council area.
