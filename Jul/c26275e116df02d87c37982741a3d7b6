Paris Saint-Germain’s Kylian Mbappe is doubtful for the Champions League after suffering a serious ankle injury in the French Cup final, the French champions announced on Saturday. Mbappe hobbled off in the first half of Friday’s game after a dreadful tackle by Saint-Etienne captain Loic Perrin. And after tests PSG revealed that their 21-year-old star had “a sprained right ankle with significant ligament damage”. The news is a major blow for PSG with Mbappe out of next Friday’s French League Cup final and unlikely to be fit in time for next month’s Champions League quarter-final against Atalanta in Lisbon. He received lengthy treatment but was eventually substituted after the tackle which earned Perrin a red card. “Everyone is worried. Everyone who saw the foul is worried. Of course I’m worried,” said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel after his team’s 1-0 win.
