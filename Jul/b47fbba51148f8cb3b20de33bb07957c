Acting Managing Director of Interim Management Committee(IMC) the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) Professor Kemebradikumo Pondei and his team on Thursday walked out on the House of Representatives Committee on NDDC. He said he and the team were not prepared to make any presentation before the committee. Pondei had abjected to Chairman of the Committee, Olubunmi Tunji-Ojo, presiding over the investigative hearing, insisting he cannot preside over a matter in which he is an accused. Members of the Committee, including Benjamin Kali, Ben Ibakpa and Shehu Koko, told the Acting MD that since there was no document before them, he is constitutionally bound to answer their queries. While members were still making contribution on the issue, the Acting MD sought permission to leave and walked out before the committee could grant or reject his request. Furious members of the Committee accused the Interim Management Committee of trying to frustrate legislative functions and ordered a warrant of arrest be issued against him. The Committee also unanimously passed a vote of confidence on its Chairman. Details shortlyâ€¦
