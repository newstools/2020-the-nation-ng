 The Ekiti State Government yesterday warned traders not to display goods on walkways, road medians and other unauthorised places. Deputy Governor Bisi Egbeyemi, who paid an unscheduled visit to Erekesan and Bisi markets in Ado-Ekiti, advised traders to abide by the COVID-19 protocols, including regular washing of hands, use of face masks, sanitisers and avoiding overcrowding. Egbeyemi said Governor Kayode Fayemi is concerned about the safety of traders and their customers, hence the need for enforcement of rules following the decision to open markets for owners of lock-up shops. According to a statement by his Special Assistant (Media), Odunayo Ogunmola, Egbeyemi was joined during the inspection by the General Manager, Ekiti State Traffic Management Agency (EKSTMA), Chief Femi Olanrewaju; Commandant, Ekiti State Peace Corps, Mr. Dele Owoju; and other government officials. Egbeyemi, who took time to move to sections of the two markets where he educated traders and their customers on COVID-19 safety protocols, condemned displaying of goods on drainages by shop owners.  He said Coronavirus is real and kills without minding class and age, adding that markets have been identified as places where it can spread, hence the need for compliance following the reopening of the markets. The deputy governor said any trader who displayed goods at unauthorised places would not only have his wares seized, he would also be prosecuted in line with extant laws. Noting that the government was not interested in denying them their means of livelihood, Egbeyemi said only compliance with rules would keep the markets open. He warned traders against throwing caution to the wind, which could lead to the shutting down of the markets again. The deputy governor said inspection of the markets would now be a regular exercise, as the government was determined to combat COVID-19 and ensure peopleâ€™s safety.
