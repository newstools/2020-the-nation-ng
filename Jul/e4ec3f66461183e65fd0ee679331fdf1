 YUL Edochie has omitted his father, Pete Edochie’s name from his list of stars that helped shaped his acting career. The younger Edochie recently took to his social media accounts to acknwoledge some of Nollywood greats that have positively impacted on his career while growing up. “These Stars helped shape my career. RMD, Ramsey, Emeka Ike, Jim Iyke, Chidi Mokeme, Muna Obiekwe, Emeka Enyiocha, Desmond Elliot, Mike Ezuruonye, Nonso Diobi. Then, if I no get money to buy their films I’ll rent from a video club. Not just to enjoy but to learn acting from them,” he shared on social media platforms that include Twitter and Instagram. He continued under the same post on instagram “As I prayed this morning I remembered the early days of my acting career (2005, 06, 07). I salute these great men.” His post however got his fans stirred up as some said he didn’t acknowledge his father whom he inherited his bass voice from. Yul Edochie recently launched ‘Yul Edochie’ academy in Asaba, Delta state, whereby he personally teaches students the ethics of the craft of acting.
