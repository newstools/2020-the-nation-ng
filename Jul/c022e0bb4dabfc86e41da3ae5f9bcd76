 DEATH toll caused by the COVID-19 pandemic rose to 52 in Rivers State on Sunday, according to the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). The statistics published by the centre showed that the state had so far recorded 1,640 cases of the virus, 446 infected persons on admission in various isolation centres and 1,142 persons treated and discharged. Investigations at the weekend, however, revealed that most residents were unserious with measures put in place to prevent the spread of the virus. Residents were seen going about their normal activities without adhering to the precautionary measures of wearing face masks and maintaining physical distancing. The initial handwashing ritual, which accompanied transactions in public places like malls, supermarkets and hotels, was gradually disappearing. Most supermarkets, eateries, malls and other public places, no longer maintained handwashing facilities. Some of them, however, poured sanitisers on their customersâ€™ palms before allowing them access to their facilities. Notable shopping malls made wearing of face masks compulsory before their entrance. Other supermarkets in Port Harcourt were not interested in implementing such COVID-19 protocol. Governor Nyesom Wike, in his last broadcast, lamented the refusal by residents to adhere to the preventive protocol and promised to set up a task force to arrest persons not wearing face masks in public places.
