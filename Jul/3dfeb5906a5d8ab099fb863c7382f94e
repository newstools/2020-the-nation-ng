The ongoing Administrative probe of the embattled acting Chairman of Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) Ibrahim Magu will give him the opportunity to respond to allegations leveled against him, a Presidency source said on Tuesday. The source, who spoke under anonymity, also said Justice Ayo Salami-led investigative panel became necessary because of the anti-corruption stance of the government. The source noted that the Magu investigation had proved that no public servant, no matter how highly placed, is above scrutiny, especially when allegations are leveled. He said: “The panel investigating allegations against the EFCC chief had been sitting for some weeks now. “In consonance with the principle of fairness and justice, it was needful that the acting chairman be given the opportunity to respond to the allegations, which are weighty in nature. “Under the Muhammadu Buhari administration, nobody is above scrutiny. “The investigation is to reinforce transparency and accountability, rather than to vitiate it. “Accountability for our actions or inactions is an inalienable part of democracy. “In such elevated position as that of EFCC Chairman, the holder of the position must be above suspicion. “There’s no prejudgment. Absolutely none. The Buhari administration can be counted on to uphold fairness and justice at all times”, the source added. Chief of Staff to the President Prof. Ibrahim Gambari met with the panel investigating allegations leveled against Magu. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the agenda of the meeting between Gambari and members of the panel headed by Justice Salami was unknown.
