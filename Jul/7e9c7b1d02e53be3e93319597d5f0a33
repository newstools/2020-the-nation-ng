 In its quest to support fact-based reporting, Nestlé Nigeria in conjunction with the Lagos Business School has trained journalists on advancing nutrition, health and wellness reporting across the country. The journalists drawn from different media houses participated in virtual classes which exposed them to information on nutrition health and wellness. Justifying the importance of the training, Corporate Communications and Public Affairs Manager of Nestlé Nigeria, Victoria Uwadoka said, “The essence of this training is to provide a platform for journalists to acquire knowledge and skills to improve fact-based storytelling to help their audiences and consumers get the right information to make the right nutrition and lifestyle choices to promote a healthier lifestyle.” On his part, Director, LBS Sustainability Centre, Professor Chris Ogbechie said, “Building the capacity of the media is key to Nigeria’s achievement of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, especially SDG3- good health and wellbeing. This is why Lagos Business School and Nestle Nigeria developed the Advancing NHW through the media programme to harness the impact the media can have through professional and innovative reporting on nutrition health and wellness issues.”
