Rivers Governor, Nyesom Wike, who rushed into the residence of a former Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Joy Nunieh, following alleged police harassment , has taken her to the Government House. Wike was said to have arrived the house, which was surrounded by over 15 armed policemen, in the morning. He reportedly bulldozed his way into the building and zoomed off with the embattled ex-NDDC managing director.
