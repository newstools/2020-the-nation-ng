A 70-year-old man, Mohammed Sani, narrowly escaped being lynched by a mob after he was allegedly caught raping a nine-year-old girl in his shop in Kasuwan Dare in Chanchaga Local Government Area of Niger State. The angry mob stripped him naked and was about lynching him when police intervened. The scream of the nine-year-old reportedly alerted passersby, and soon a mob was formed. “I knew she is an underage girl, but cannot tell how it all happened,” the suspect said. “I think it is devil’s work.” Police spokesman Wasiu Abiodun said the suspect would soon be arraigned in court.
