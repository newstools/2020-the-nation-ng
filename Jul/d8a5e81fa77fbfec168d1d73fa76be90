Reports emerging from Naples, Italy hinted that Victor Osimhen’s purported move to Naples is being delayed by the 21-year-old who is pondering over the move. Valter De Maggio, a veteran journalist with Radio Kiss Kiss Napoli and an insider in Napoli affairs, speaking during Radio Goal, confirmed that the Lille striker asked for more time to study his option concerning future transfers. De Maggio said: “As for the deal for the Nigerian striker Victor Osimhen, we can tell you there is still no white smoke; the boy asked for more time, but the news that comes to us is that the entourage (with Osimhen) is pressing him say “Know that Naples is the best choice for your career.”. “Osimhen takes time, wants to reflect better but the entourage is pressing him,” De Maggio added. Another Neapolitan journalist Ciro Venerato corroborated De Maggio, adding that Napoli’s head coach Gennaro Gattuso and chairman Aurelio De Laurentiis had expected a positive response from Osimhen after talks last week. “A few minutes ago I heard his entourage and they are disappointed because after the boy’s arrival in Naples and talks with Gattuso and De Laurentiis, they expected the boy’s yes around Tuesday. This did not happen and we are behind schedule.” Venerato was quoted on www.calcionapoli24.it “Osimhen entourage is oriented towards Naples because according to them there is a need for a further step before going to one of the best clubs in the world.” Venerato also added that Lille needs the money from Osimhen’s transfer and has favoured Napoli because the Italian side is the only club to officially show interest in the former Charleroi forward.
