The Ondo State Independent Electoral Commission (ODIEC) has fixed August 22, 2020 for the conduct of local government election in the state. It had earlier fixed the local elections for April 18 but suspended it due to the outbreak of COVID-19. Chairman of ODIEC, Prof. Yomi Dinakin, who stated this in Akure at a meeting with leaders of political parties in the state said the commission would comply strictly with the protocols of the Presidential Task Force on COVID -19 during the conduct of the election. This is the first time local elections will be held in Ondo State since the coming of Akeredoluâ€™s administration in 2016. Prof. Dinakin cautioned all political parties and voters to adhere strictly to all COVID-19 precautionary measures as stipulated by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) which include wearing of face mask, washing of hands, the use of hand sanitizer and most importantly, maintaining physical distance during the voting exercise. Dinakin stated that there would be no open campaign rallies, and urged contestants to use the social media, electronic, print and others to canvass for votes within the stipulated period of campaign. Chairman of Inter Party Advisory Council (IPAC), Mr. Charles Fagbounka, said the decision to hold local elections after a very long period of suspension due to COVID-19 pandemic was commendable. He assured that political parties participating in the local election would do all to make the election a success.
