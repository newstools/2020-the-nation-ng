Chairman of the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) in Ondo, Hon. Joseph Akinlaja, has rested speculations on whether Deputy Governor Agboola Ajayi would defect to the party. Akinlaja said the ZLP was ready to welcome new members, including Ajayi. In a message he sent to party members on Wednesday, Akinlaja urged ZLP members to begin mobilising for the “tasks ahead.” Akinlaja said the ZLP was the beautiful bride of all parties in the state. According to him: “You would recall my address to you during our party primary election that we are going to run for the Governorship election of Ondo State and win. “After the party primaries of other parties, Our ZLP has become the BEAUTIFUL BRIDE of all parties. “For those coming, including HE Agboola AJAYI they are all welcome into our great party. “I thank you all as you should be prepared for hard work for victory.”
