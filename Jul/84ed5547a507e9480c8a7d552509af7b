 Sheffield United are not thinking about European qualification and their focus is on finishing the Premier League season on a high according to manager Chris Wilder. Having returned to the top flight for the first time since 2007, the Blades have punched above their weight to move up to seventh in the league, occupying the final Europa League spot with four games left. “It’s not felt like pushing for Europe all the way through, it’s been media talk,” Wilder told a news conference. “I can’t control that. “I can only control our performances. I am looking for a big finish and we demand a big finish no matter what advantages other clubs have over us.” United, unbeaten in five home league games following Wednesday’s last-gasp 1-0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers, host in-form Chelsea at Bramall Lane today.
