Gunmen have reportedly abducted Pa Chilaka, father of a Commissioner in Abia State Oil Producing Area Development Commission (ASOPADEC); Henry Chilaka. Pa Chilaka is a community leader in Ugwuati community, in Ukwa West Local Government area of the state. It was gathered that the abductors arrived their victim’s compound around 10pm on Tuesday and knocked on his door. Pa Chilaka, who thought that the knock on the door was from his children, reportedly opened the door to his living room only to behold men wielding gun who forcefully took him that night to an unknown destination. More than 36 hours after his abduction, Pa Chilaka’s abductors were yet to establish contact with his family members, fueling speculations among natives that the hoodlums may be holding on the septuagenarian to get his sons who is well placed in Abia government. It was gathered that the gang that kidnapped Pa Chilaka was the same that has been terrorizing the area in the past three weeks when three persons were reportedly kidnapped. One of those that were abducted last week, simply identified as Osita (a transporter) from Oraifite in Egwusigo Local Government of Anambra State, was reportedly kidnapped at Umuozuo community in Ukwa West Local Government Area, regained his freedom after being in captive for three days and paying N1.4m ransom. When contacted, the State Command Police Public Relations Officer, Geoffrey Ogbonna said police had not been informed about the incident. A military source however confirmed Pa Chilaka’s kidnap, but regretted that the family members had not cooperated with the military to ensure his release.
