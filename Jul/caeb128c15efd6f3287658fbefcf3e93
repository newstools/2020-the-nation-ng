 CHAIRMAN Senate Committee on the Independent National Electoral Commission Senator Kabiru Gaya on Wednesday said that the upper chamber is keen on passing amendments to the Electoral Act, 2010. Gaya spoke while responding to questions from Senate correspondents in Abuja. According to him, the committee will soon subject the Bill to a public hearing to garner the input of critical stakeholders and Nigerians to the Bill. Gaya said: “Few months before the COVID-19 pandemic we had a retreat in Lagos with INEC commissioners, the chairman himself and other international stakeholders came in also to contribute to the process and all members had a draft of the electoral act amendment, which we discussed. “I also invited INEC to give us their input based on their experience on the last few elections and the problem they had with the Act, what will be their advice on the areas to amend or his own suggestions on the amendment on the existing Act. We have compiled both the two reports and we intend to have a public hearing. “We were just discussing with the members how soon we will do the public hearing so that we can present this report to the Senate for the third reading and then forward it to the President for signing.”
