A bridal and gift shop located at the popular Igbudu Market in Warri South council area of Delta state, was early Saturday, engulfed in fire. The Nation learnt that the fire started at about 6am and lasted for nearly an hour. The timely intervention of youths in the area, as well as other traders reportedly saved the situation. Sources at the market disclosed that the fire may have been caused by an electrical spark due to fluctuation of power. According to sources, a woman who noticed smoke coming out of the locked shop, raised an alarm that drew the attention of those who put out the fire. One of the youths who spoke with The Nation said “it was one mama that called that fire was burning in the shop.
