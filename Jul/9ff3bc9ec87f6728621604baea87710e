Caligerian who hails from Ibadan is the third child of four siblings. According to him, as a teenager growing up he was loved by people due to his involvement in engaging kids in the game of soccer while he was in Ekiti state before relocating to California, USA. He also revealed that World renowned American Dj Khalid is his greatest motivation bearing in mind the relationship he creates among other artists by having more than three artists on a song which encourages love and togetherness in the industry.
