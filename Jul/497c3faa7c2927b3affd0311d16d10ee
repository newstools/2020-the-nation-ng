Mohamed Salah couldn’t hide his delight at Liverpool’s title triumph when he sat down with Sky Sports’ Jamie Carragher ahead of the Reds’ clash with Manchester City on Thursday night. That fixture at the Etihad could have been a fitting way for Liverpool to clinch the crown, giving Jurgen Klopp’s side the potential to defeat the defending champions on their own patch to underline Liverpool’s dominance in the title race this season. But Salah says City’s defeat at Chelsea last Thursday instead allowed him and his Liverpool team-mates a special opportunity to celebrate together. “It was an unbelievable feeling, when Chelsea scored the second one, it was like ‘wow’, it was a party. We tried to keep the distance but it doesn’t work sometimes but we did our best.”
