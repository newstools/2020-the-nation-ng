 The see-saw hugely anticipated transfer of  Super Eagles  striker Victor Osimhen from OSC Lille in the French Ligue 1 to Napoli in the Italian Serie A may have suffered a huge setback after all. Though Napoli has reportedly tabled an impressive offer  for a potential five-year deal, Football Italia said Osimhen would most likely reject the deal as he awaits new offers from an English Premier League side. The Nigeria international visited the Napoli facilities, coach Gennaro Gattuso’s home and the house of President Aurelio De Laurentiis on the island of Capri. According to Football t Italia: “He asked for a few days to think about it, but after weeks of charm offensive from both clubs and his entourage, the Nigeria international has decided against the transfer. “Our sources close to Osimhen confirm he feels pressured into the move to Napoli, hurt by the fact his agent worked out all the details before asking for his opinion. “It is not a rejection of Napoli per se, but rather an internal issue with his entourage, Lille and the way the matter was handled.” Osimhen has his eyes on a Premier League move and is reportedly waiting for Arsenal or Manchester United to step forward. Napoli had been due to pay the 50m Euros fee, with a huge salary, but the 21-year-old is not making this a move about money. He scored 18 goals in 38 competitive games for Lille this season, along with six assists. Lille signed Osimhen from Charleroi for 14m Euros a year ago. There were also reports in the French media today that Inter were making a bid for Osimhen, but that has already been discounted by both Sport Italia and sources close to the player. Yet English tabloid Telegraph claimed Napoli is prepared to sell Kalidou Koulibaly to the Premier League this summer, hoping to make back the possible money spent on Osimhen.
