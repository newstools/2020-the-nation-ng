The Office of the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) on Monday arraigned 10 suspected pirates for hijacking a Chinese fishing vessel off the Cote D’Ivoire coast. The defendants are: Frank Abaka, Jude Ebaragha, Shina Alolo, Joshua Iwiki, David Akinseye, Ahmed Toyin, Shobajo Saheed, Adekole Philip, Matthew Masi and Bright Agbedeyi. They were charged on three counts before Justice Ayokunle Faji. The government told the court that the defendants “while armed with weapons, committed an illegal act of violence against the crew on board FV Hai Lu Feng II belonging to Haina Fishing Company by putting them in fear in order to take control of the vessel.” Prosecution counsel Laraban Magaji said the  incident occurred in May this year in international waters off Abidjan, Cote D’Ivoire. The defendants pleaded not guilty, and were remanded in the Nigerian Navy’s custody as  Justice Faji adjourned the case till July 15.
