Two persons were feared dead in a shooting spree by rivalry cult groups in Oko community, Aguata Local Government Area of Anambra state. The deceased, suspected to be cultists were reportedly gunned down by the rampaging cultists said to be on a reprisal attack. The Nation gathered that there was palpable tension in the community, despite the heavy presence of security agencies in the area. A resident who preferred anonymity said two persons died in the shooting spree while others sustained injuries. He said, “As at 9:15 pm shooting was still ongoing as everyone was indoors unknown of the next move. Already, two students have been shot dead while others sustained serious gun injuries. “The first person was shot around Eke market Oko opposite J-Mok fuel station and the second person was killed at Living Stone hostel, Oko.” Reacting, member, Oko Community Caretaker committee, and Secretary, Ifite Oko village General Assembly, Chief Ernest Nwosu disclosed that the deceased were students of the Federal Polytechnic Oko who stayed back during COVID-19 lockdown. He said, “One of the victims is a student but operates a movie center where he sells recharge card and charges phones. “The killing was a reprisal attack of a student who was an indigene killed last week by cultists.” He called on the Assistant Inspector General of Police Zone 13, State Commissioner for Police, John Abang to deploy the Anti-cultism squad Enugu Ukwu and other police teams to quell the mayhem in the area.
