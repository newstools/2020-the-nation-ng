There was a fire on Monday at a section of one of the World Trade Centre buildings in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The building is the tallest residential and commercial structure undergoing construction in the city. The cause of the fire could not be ascertained immediately, but our correspondent learnt that it started around 11:30 a.m as smoke was seen billowing from the 25-storey hi-tech building. A worker in the building, who did not want his name in print, said the fire was not serious. He said internal sprinklers installed in the building were deployed to put off the fire. The worker said there was no damage to the building, adding that nobody was injured. Fire service trucks and Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) rescue buses and ambulances were seen within and outside the premises. The Director of FCT Fire Service, Mr. Opetusin Julius, could not be reached on Monday for comment on the cause of the fire.
