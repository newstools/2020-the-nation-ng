Police have arrested five women in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital, for allegedly trading in children. It was gathered that the suspects were intercepted at Rumuokuta Junction while haggling over a two-week old baby. One of the suspects, Roseline Nwokocha was apprehended with his sister Chioma, who accompanied her for the transaction. She said: “I came from Umuahia, [Abia State]. I was arrested at Rumuokuta Junction. This sister, Chichi called me that there was a two-week-old baby for sale and asked me to come if I had somebody that will buy the baby. I came to check the baby very well. She told me the baby was N1m. This is not the first time I came to buy a baby. “I bought the first one at N1.1million and also collected N1.1million for this one from the person that wanted the child”. She confessed that she gave the first baby she bought to a couple in Aba, Abia State but refused to mention their names. Police spokesman Nnamdi Omoni said the matter was being investigated.
