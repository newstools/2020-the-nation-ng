 HEAD of Nigeria Women Football League (NWFL), Aisha Falode, has declared that the decision of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) to put the proposed Women’s CAF Champions League on the front burner in their next meeting in Cairo towards the actualisation of the league in 2021, is a dream come true for her. Falode, who is also a board member of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), stressed that, the success recorded by Nigeria’s Super Falcons which played with seven NWPL clubs’ players at the France 2019 Women’s World Cup, must have played a prominent role in the decision taken by CAF to uplift women’s football in the continent at the club level. She said: “People have advocated for it and desired it on the continent for the young women who continue to play good football all around Africa. When people say that we do not have the required number of teams to play the Women’s CAF Champions League, I wonder where they got that notion from. “As we speak, we have over 33 countries across the continent where organized women’s football league is played. That’s way above average for a good number to start the CAF Women’s Champions League, as the time is ripe and right for Africa to have a women’s Champions League.”
