 TWENTY-TWO persons have been killed in Southern Kaduna communities in Zangon Kataf Local Government Area of Kaduna State, the Southern Kaduna Peoples Union (SOKAPU) has said. The mouthpiece of the communities raised the alarm over what it called “continuous killing” of its people. In a statement by its National Public Relations Officer, Luka Binniyat yesterday, SOKAPU said the attacks were carried out despite a 24-hour curfew in the local government area. “In the early hours of Friday, 10th July, 2020, precisely around 1.30am, a suspected Fulani militia invaded a remote, peaceful farming community called Chibob in Atyap Chiefdom, Gora ward of Zangon Kataf Local Government Area. The unprovoked attack ended in the massacre of nine Atyap natives, mostly women and children who were murdered in their sleep in the most barbaric manner,” he said, adding that the invaders also burnt down over 20 houses, destroyed farmlands, rustled 24 cattle and livestock, and looted foodstuff, among other things. “As the curfew persisted, in the early hours of the following day, being Saturday the 11th July, 2020, the militia continued their attacks in neighbouring remote communities. In particular, they attacked Kigudu community which is close to Chibob, located at the boundary between Zangon Kataf and Kauru LGAs. This led to the death of 10 women, an infant and an old man who were burnt to death inside a house they had taken refuge. Police spokesman ASP Mohammed Jalige could not confirm the attacks before press time.
