The eagerly expected transfer of Super Eagles striker Victor Osimhen to Italian Serie A side , Napoli, is delicately hanging in the balance if the words of Napoli President Aurelio De Laurentiis is anything to go by. Though the Gli Azzurri (The Blues) are regarded as the frontrunner for the signature of the 21-year-old Lille forward, Laurentiis  said he was not sure Osimhen will be a part of the club’s  pre-season programme. With few weeks left to spare in the current campaign, most  Serie A clubs are expected to turn their attention  towards the 2020/2021 Italian season  which is expected to kick off on September 12; but Laurentiis  said he was not sure Osimhen will be a part of the club’s pre-season despite the fact that the Gli Azzurri (The Blues) are regarded as the frontrunner for the signature of the 21-year-old Lille forward. According to football Italia,  Laurentiis is worried  that the ‘on-going transfer saga of Lille forward Viktor Osimhen has not been settled.’ “Who knows, that’s the beauty of football,” Laurentiis was quoted as saying while speaking of the club’s preparation ahead of the 2020/21 season.“ He comes from another continent and still has no new agent, but he will see that we go to a nice place like Castel di Sangro (Napoli designated preseason venue in the Province of L’Aquila).” A source privy to the Osimhen camp informed NationSport  that nothing is concluded as per the movement of the 2015 CAF Youth Player of the Year, adding  they are weighing all available options. But the Napoli boss  was quick to confirm that coach Gennaro Gattuso who is a huge fan of Osimhen, will continue to tinker The Blues. Gattuso recently hinted in a Sky Sports Italia interview  that he would ring changes should Osimhen teamed up with his side: “He’s (Osimhen) different, but I don’t want to talk about that. If and when Osimhen joins, then I’ll explain the changes.”
