 A GROUP, Global Peace and Life Rescue Initiative, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to deploy more troops to Southern Kaduna to quell the violence there. The organisation also commended Governor Nasir El-Rufai, and Operation Safe Haven, the military outfit stationed in Plateau and Southern Kaduna. The group, working on sustainable peace building in Southern Kaduna and other restive parts of Nigeria, in a statement on Thursday by its Executive Director, Melvin Ejeh and Dr Kefas Kure, the Southern Kaduna Coordinator, also urged communities in the area to key into peace-building efforts of the federal government and Governor Nasir El-Rufai. “We appeal to President Muhammadu Buhari to order more deployment of air and land troops to Southern Kaduna,” the statement said.
