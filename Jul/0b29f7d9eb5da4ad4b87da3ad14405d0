LAPO Microfinance Bank has disclaimed report saying it settled over N1.88 billion in a period of five years. In a statement, the bank saying it remains focused on its core mandate of empowering low-income earners. The company affirmed that the assertion of settling insurance claims was a misrepresentation of the risk benefits that accrued to its customers from their insurance companies. “The insurance claims referred to in the publication were aggregation of claims settlement by different insurance companies that LAPO MfB work with during the period under reference and from which our customers benefited. LAPO MFB is a microfinance bank and not purported to play the role of insurance company,” it said in a statement. “The headline does not reflect our narratives. Given the above, we kindly inform members of the public and other stakeholders to disregard the said publication. LAPO Microfinance bank remains committed to its over thirty 30 years (first as a non-profit) old mandate of social and economic empowerment of low-income households in Nigeria and beyond,” it added.
