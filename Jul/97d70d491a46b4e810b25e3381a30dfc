Serena Williams shared the most adorable pictures of her and her mini-me daughter Alexis Olympia playing tennis together- but all fans could talk about were the two-year-old’s impressive abs! One particular photo, shared on Olympia’s own personal Instagram, shows the duo dressed exactly the same in a black skirt and a tight purple top, which highlights their toned bodies. “Six pack baby stroooooong,” captioned proud dad Alexis Ohanian. Another fan added: “Love the abs Olympia.” A third remarked: “Baby girl has a six pack already.” A fourth follower commented: “Strong like mom!” Proud mum Serena also shared several snaps from their fun day together, and if the pictures are anything to go by, we predict her adorable two-year-old daughter is heading straight to Wimbledon! Serena’s sister was quick to react to the snaps, with her writing: “I just love her and you too much! If this gets any cuter I will NOT LIVE!” It seems Olympia loves tennis just as much as her champion mother A friend added: “THIS IS INCREDIBLE! 2035 WIMBELDON DOUBLES CHAMPS!” With all tennis competitions cancelled due to the pandemic, Serena has been making the most of her time with her daughter whilst they self-isolate at their Miami home.  Most recently, the tennis champ shared an adorable video of herself and her young daughter dancing around the front room in matching Beauty and the Beast costumes. Most impressive of all, though, was an incredible piece of furniture that could be seen in the background. Next to Serena’s huge grey sofas a small staircase of the same colour was visible, allowing little Olympia access to the settee so she can sit and watch TV with her famous mum – how cute is that! Olympia, who Serena shares with her husband and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, also sweetly clutched a bucket of tasty-looking popcorn in the clip.
