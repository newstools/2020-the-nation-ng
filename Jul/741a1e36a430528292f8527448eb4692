 Nigeria striker Paul Onuachu has reportedly  tested positive to  the novel coronavirus. In a report by Belgian tabloid, Het Laaste Niuews , the 26-year-old tested positive at his club and has  since gone into isolation. Incidentally, Onuachu was the only  RC Genk player that tested positive for COVID19 as the club conducted tests in preparation for its first pre-season game. Ahead of the club exhibition game, all the players were tested, including compatriots Stephen Odey and Cyril Dessers, and they were all negative except the towering striker who will now miss his team’s pre-season friendly tomorrow. “In the run-up to the first exhibition game of the season, the entire Genk group was tested yesterday (Tuesday),” a report on Belgian website hln.be stated. “Everyone tested negative except Onuachu.”
