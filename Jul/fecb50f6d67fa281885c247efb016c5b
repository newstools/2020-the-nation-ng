 THE Peopleâ€™s Democratic Party (PDP) in Akwa Ibom State has elected new members of its state executive. The election was attended by 3,845 delegates, with the 39 offices each having a sole aspirant. Udo Ekpenyong is the new chairman. Harrison Ekpo was elected Secretary and Borono Bassey is Publicity Secretary. Ekpenyong was a former Political Adviser to former Governor Victor Attah and until his election, was the Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs. Governor Udom Emmanuel said the party is challenged to do more for the growth of the state despite its numerous achievements. He lauded efforts of the outgoing State Executive Committee (SEC) in repositioning the party and enthroning peace. Ekpenyong, who attributed his election to God, promised to be focused and take the party to greater heights.
