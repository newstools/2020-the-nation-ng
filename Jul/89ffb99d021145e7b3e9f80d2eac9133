The University of Lagos Branch of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), has warned the institution’s Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of Governing Council, Dr. Wale Babalakin not to show up on campus to avoid violence. The union also called on the Education Minister, Mallam Adamu Adamu, and the Executive Secretary, National Universities Commission (NUC), Prof. Abubakar Rasheed, to check Babalakin’s activities following its no confidence vote passed on Governing Council Chairman for his role in the postponement of the university’s 51st convocation in March. In a statement by the ASUU-UNILAG chairman, Dr. Dele Ashiru, the union warned Babalakin against visiting the Campus for a Council meeting planned to hold from Wednesday to Friday. The statement reads: “The attention of our Union has been drawn to a surreptitious Council meeting summoned by Dr. Bolanle Olawale Babalakin. “Our Union wishes to remind members of the University community and the general public that the vote of no confidence passed on Dr. Wale Babalakin and his persona non grata status on account of the unfortunate cancellation of the University’s convocation ceremonies occasioned by him has not been vacated by the Congress of our great Union. “Consequently, Dr. Wale Babalakin should be advised to rethink his intention of entering the University of Lagos campus as his presence may rupture the long cherished peace and tranquility on our campus. “Our Union therefore respectfully call on the Honourable Minister of Education Mallam Adamu Adamu and the Executive Secretary of the National Universities Commission (NUC) Prof. Abubakar Rasheed to please rein in Dr. Wale Babalakin. He should also be held squarely responsible for any breakdown of law and order which his presence on our campus may create.” Efforts to reach Babalakin were unsuccessful as he neither answered call nor message sent to his phone. The ASUU-UNILAG has also called for a Congress to hold on Wednesday.
