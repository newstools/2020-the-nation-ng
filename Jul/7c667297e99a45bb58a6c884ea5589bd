Keystone Bank Limited has advised Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) owners to grow their sales using digital tools. The bank stated this during   a  capacity building initiative  for MSMEs owners in Lagos. The training, tagged: “Boost With Facebook Digital Marketing Webinar Series,” was organised by the bank in partnership with Facebook via its Nigerian representative, Rabbington Media. The Head of MSME at Keystone Bank, Helen Nwelle, said: “The COVID-19 pandemic has affected a large number of SMEs who can no longer operate through physical stores and outlets and as such, the need to have an active online presence cannot be over-emphasised. “Hence, the sessions provided a lot of learnings to enable businesses take advantage of the digital tools available on Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram etc to reach new customers and grow their businesses.” Also, Chief Executive Officer of Rabbington Media, Okemini Otum, said: “The turnout was far beyond our expectations, and we want to be able to reach many more SMEs through more partnerships like these. We commend the passion and commitment from Keystone Bank in seeing to the success of the project. “The numerous testimonials from participants at the webinar proved how timely the training was and the needs it addressed in their various businesses and participants took away learnings which a lot of them immediately began to apply into building an online presence for their businesses.”
