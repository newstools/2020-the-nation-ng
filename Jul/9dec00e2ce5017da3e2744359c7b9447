Policemen who allegedly tortured and extorted a man, Olumide Bakare, of N26,000 in Lagos have been arrested. Bakare narrated his ordeal on Twitter on Wednesday, alleging that the policemen attached to Ogudu Division, unlawfully arrested him, tortured and forced a video statement from him before fleecing him of N260,000. He said he was in a taxi which the policemen flagged down and illegally searched his phones and personal items. Finding nothing except a phrase “gay men dey pay” in a group chat Bakare had with some friends, the rogue officers then unleashed terror on him, checked his bank account balance and then demanded N500,000 only to settle for N260,000 which they received via Paga. Bakare said, “Some members of the Nigerian Police (Ogudu branch), forced a confession, statement and N260,000 out of me. They beat, threatened and made me feel completely powerless. I have not recovered from the harassment, but I need this story to be out there “They stopped my Uber and asked the driver to drive us straight to Ogudu police station. When we got there, they took us to one small corner in the police station with two wooden rooms. “They collected my phones, my air pods, ID card. Even as I explained that I was an influencer and work for several brands, they kept on searching my email, IG, Twitter and my WhatsApp for God knows what. “They told me to take off my shirt and started beating me with a pipe. They forced me to write a statement saying I had male clients who paid me to have casual sex with them and even listed names for me. They told me to add amounts to the front of the names too and recorded me confessing at gun point.” Spokesman Bala Elkana said those involved have been arrested and detained following directives from Commissioner of Police (CP) Hakeem Odumosu.
