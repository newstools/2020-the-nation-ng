 THE Nigerian Army has said the Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen. Tukur Buratai, is in Katsina State on an operational tour of formations and units under 8 Division to assess their operational readiness. It said the Army chief is not relocating to the state due to increasing attacks and killings by badits. Buratai is also expected to witness this year’s Army Day celebration which begins today and runs till July 6. The celebration, which was originally planned to hold in Jos, the Plateau State capital, was rescheduled to Katsina to boost current military operations against banditry in the state and other parts of the Northwest. Already, the Army has announced a military exercise, code-named: Sahel Sanity, which is reportedly yielding results.  The development may not be unconnected to President Muhammadu Buhari’s directive to the military that they root out bandits in the state and other Northwest states. The clarification came on the heels of reports that the Army Chief would relocate to Katsina and remain in the state until banditry is rooted out. The Acting Director of Army Public Relations, Colonel Sagir Musa, said Buratai’s visit will boost military operation and morale of troops fighting banditry and other forms of criminality in the state and other parts of the northwest. He said the Army chief was quoted out of context as the purpose of his visit to Katsina was clear.
