 FEDERAL Capital Territory (FCT) Minister Muhammad Bello has cancelled Eid prayers at the National Eid prayer ground on the Umaru Musa Yar’Adua Expressway (Airport Road), Abuja. This is coming as Osun State also announced the cancellation of Eid congregation prayers for Friday, but approved Juma’at services owing to the coincidence that the Eid-el- Kabir and Juma’at fall on the same day. The FCT minister advised worshippers to hold Eid prayers at the premises of their neighbourhoods’ Juma’at mosques. Bello gave the advice when he chaired a meeting between the FCTA and members of a delegation from the FCT League of Imams Initiative, led by its chairman, Dr. Tajudeen Adigun, to discuss the modalities of holding Eid prayers for the Eid-el-Kabir celebrations. He also warned that Eid prayers should last for a maximum of one hour only between 8 and 10 in the morning. In a statement issued on Wednesday by his Chief Press Secretary, Anthony Ogunleye, the minister thanked the religious leaders for their cooperation in the battle against COVID-19 in the FCT. Also, a statement by Secretary to the Osun State Government, Prince Wole Oyebamiji, yesterday noted that the state is still recording rising figures of confirmed COVID-19 cases amidst an active community transmission stage of the pandemic. He said people whose COVID-19 status has not been ascertained would be travelling into the state from different parts of the country, in the spirit of the celebration and as a result, large gathering cannot be allowed. But, in line with the observance of the existing government protocol on COVID-19, the Lagos State Government has appealed to Muslim faithful to celebrate the Eid-el-Kabir in low key. Commissioner for Home Affairs Prince Anofiu Elegushi, who stated this in his office, admonished Muslims to maintain moderation as they celebrate the festivities.
