The  Lagos  State Polytechnic  (LASPOTECH ) has begun a cage culture pilot project for  large-scale fish farming at Agbowa-Ikosi  Beach, Epe  Division  of the state  where the polytechnic acquired  about  five acres  of aquatic  land. The project is also  intended  to  serve  as  a  training and research field for staff  and  students. To  kick-start  the  project,  the  polytechnic organised a  sensitisation  programme titled: Optimising the  Performance  of  Fisherfolks  at  Agbowa-Ikosi  Fishing Community Tuesday last week during which  fishermen  in  the  community were exposed to modern fishing  business practices. In taking up this project, the Ag. Rector, Mr. Olumide Olusola  Metilelu, said the school was fulfilling its mandate as a tertiary institution established to proffer solutions to challenges in the society.  He said introducing modern fishing techniques would help members of the community solve  various challenges in their fishing business. He urged the fishing community to imbibe the methods being introduced by the facilitators who are staff members, to boost their productivity and strengthen food security in the state. He  assured  the  community  of  the  management’s support in their areas  of need,  and that, subsequently,  more  sensitisation would be held.
