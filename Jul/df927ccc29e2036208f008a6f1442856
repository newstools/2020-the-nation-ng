The Nation reports that camping for Abule Egba fire victims was declared closed on June 30, six months and eight days since the government took charge of their shelter, feeding, healthcare and education. Handing over their certificateto the trainees, Director-General (DG) LASEMA Dr. Femi Oke-Osanyintolu said they had earlier received cheques to assist them in their resettlement as promised by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. Oke-Osanyintolu said 69 households and 25 individuals received N225,000 and N150,000 at the weekend. The LASEMA boss said, “LASEMA is the only agency saddled with the responsibility of disaster prevention, management, response and rehabilitation. Today is another phase on the Abule Egba incident. When about 320 victims were exposed to a life-threatening situation, the state government was able to cushion the effect. The government was able to improve the psychology, social and economic life of the people.”
