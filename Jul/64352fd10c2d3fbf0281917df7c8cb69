The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rep. Femi Gbajabiamila has said that lack of adequate electricity has been the bane of industrialisation and development in the country. Gbajabiamila was speaking at the opening of the investigative hearing on the Power Sector on Wednesday by the House ad hoc committee on the Power Sector, headed by the Leader of the House, Rep. Alhassan Ado Doguwa. According to the Speaker, the 9th House of Representatives is set to initiate a comprehensive review of all legislation relating to the power sector. His words: “It is no longer news that despite huge investments in the power sector, little progress may have been made. “It is becoming increasingly, worrisome that successive governments have been unable to fix the issue of power in our country; with the current state of electricity supply apparently dampening the hopes of landmark industrialization and national development. ” The last time some of you were here to witness the inauguration of this Ad Hoc Committee, we reminded you that at the onset of the 9th House of Representatives we proposed a legislative agenda that sought to initiate a comprehensive review of all legislation relating to the power sector. ‘Today’s activity is an attempt to walk the walk. This investigative hearing is the premise upon which the House of Representatives shall amass adequate information to guide us in causing the required and appropriate legislative intervention in the power sector. ” I am glad that the Ad Hoc Committee led by the Leader of the House of Representatives has not rested on its oars since its inauguration, culminating in today’s event. It is my utmost belief that they are up to speed in their plan of activities and may turn-in a report within the stipulated time frame. ” I therefore wish to appreciate members of the Ad Hoc Committee and make bold to claim that the membership selection has been vindicated by your performances thus far.,” he said.
