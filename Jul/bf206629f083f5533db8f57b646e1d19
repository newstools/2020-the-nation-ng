A lawmaker representing Ipokia-Idiroko constituency in the Ogun House of Assembly, Mrs Sikiratu Ajibola, has prescribed life imprisonment for rapists. “Enough is enough,” she told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abeokuta, Ogun State, yesterday. “We can no longer fold our arms as women; rapists must be taught a lesson in a very hard way. “This devilish acts, most times, result into psychological trauma to the victims.
