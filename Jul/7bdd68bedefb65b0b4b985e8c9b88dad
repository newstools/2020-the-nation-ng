GLASGOW Rangers have signed Nigeria centre-back Leon Balogun from Brighton & Hove Albion. The 32-year-old defender, who has 32 caps has signed a one-year contract at Ibrox and will join compatriot Joe Aribo at the Scottish Premiership club. Balogun joined Premier League side Brighton on a free transfer from German side Mainz in 2018 but his spell with the Seagulls proved a failure, managing just 12 outings for the Seagulls. He went on loan to cash-stricken Wigan in January, where he clocked up 11 appearances for the Latics and was a crucial part of Paul Cook’s side as they came within an inch of avoiding relegation – after a 12-point deduction. His Brighton contract expired this summer but Balogun extended his loan spell at Wigan until the Championship campaign had been completed.
