Nigerian and Lille striker Victor Osimhen will make a decision over the next 48 hours, after a new intermediary has helped smooth things over with Napoli. The Lille forward has repeatedly asked for more time, as he feels undue pressure from his agent and entourage to accept the Partenopei proposal. Unconfirmed sources stated that he was ready to reject the move, not so much because of Napoli, but as an act of defiance against those close to him who were trying to orchestrate the transfer. Now Radio Punto Nuovo – and sources – suggest the situation is changing, as Osimhen is being given the time and space to make his choice autonomously. “Napoli is still a possibility,” we are told by sources.  This is largely thanks to the introduction of a new intermediary in the negotiations, who is making Osimhen feel more at ease with t A choice is expected on Monday or Tuesday, so the next 48 hours are going to be crucial. The absence of hoped-for Premier League offers to materialise also contributed to his change of heart about the wisdom of moving to Napoli. Kalidou Koulibaly confirmed to La Gazzetta dello Sport that he spoke directly to Osimhen, reassuring him there was no racism problem. Also in a surprise development, Inter Milan have entered the race to sign  Osimhen, although Napoli remain strong contenders. Instead, Football Italia sources now suggest Milan are in the picture too, preparing their own proposal for Lille and the 21-year-old forward. The asking price is expected to be at least 50m Euros, so the Rossoneri would try to include some players to lower the cost of the operation.
