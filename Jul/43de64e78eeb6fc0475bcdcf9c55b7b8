Tales about alleged sublime moves of Senator Solomon Adeola (Yayi), representative of Lagos West senatorial district at the National Assembly to ‘shift’ base in 2023 and contest for the senatorial seat in his native West Senatorial District of Ogun State is daily gaining ground. But the man at the center of the stories is yet to say anything about what some political ‘mathematicians’ are claiming to be his thoughts. While the Joga Orile-born politician is truly silent on what his ambition will be in 2023, observers of the politics of the state say he’s oiling his political machinery across the Ogun West senatorial district. But some of his allies argue that he is too busy working to better the lot of the people of Lagos West to have time for political games in faraway Ogun. In fact, it was alleged that he recently told some allies of his intention to seek a third term in the senate come 2023. Those claiming he would be switching to Ogun West to seek the senatorial seat, are of the opinion that the move is in furtherance of his desire to be governor his home state after the tenure of incumbent Dapo Abiodun, who he supported in 2019. But those rooting for his continued stay in Lagos argue that Yayi is not likely to move against incumbent Senator representing the district, Tolu Odebiyi, who is most likely to seek another term come 2023. Well, we still have a little less than three years to wait for what Yayi will do in 2023.
