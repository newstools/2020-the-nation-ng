Osun State Commissioner for Youths and Sports, Yemi Lawal, said the government was investigating the ownership of the supposedly state-owned football club, Osun United. Lawal made the disclosure during a question-and-answer session with sports enthusiasts and journalists. He also said the whole sports set-up in the state would equally undergo restructuring for effective management by the state government. “The ownership of Osun United has come into contention because available records show that it was registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) by four individuals and not the state government.’’  Lawal said the record of registration of the club showed that the four individuals registered the club in the tune of five million Naira shares. “Two of them are having N1.5 million shares each, while the other two shareholders have one million Naira each.’’ He said one Baderinwa, Lawal Abiola and one Gboyega were names he could remember as registered owners of the club. “The claim that the administration of a former governor of Osun, Bisi Akande, sold the club is also being investigated to know if it was truly sold at any time and to whom or those it was sold,’’ the commissioner said.
