 A FORMER Anambra State Governor Peter Obi has cautioned the Federal Government against the cancellation of the West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE). In a statement, he said: “I hope the Federal Government realises how important it is that our Education sector comes alive with activities. Rather than completely halting academic activities, especially WASSCE, the Ministry of Education should have, by now, come up with an effective roadmap that will see our children back to school safely. “More amenities, like classrooms, equipment, and invigilators, should be provided by the government to ensure that social distancing is well enforced among students. Working hand-in-hand with other ministries will give the Ministry of Education the much-needed synergy to work out a safe plan for the resumption of schools.” Also, the Ondo State Axis of the Joint Campus Committee of the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) has faulted the cancellation of the 2020 edition of WASSCE. It said the Federal Government ought to put modalities in place to check spread of COVID-19 at examination centres instead of outright cancellation. Its Chairman, Akinteye Babatunde, stated this while addressing reporters in Akure, the state capital, at the commemoration of the eighth remembrance anniversary of four students’ leaders who died in a road accident.
