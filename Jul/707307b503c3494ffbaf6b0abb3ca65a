MANCHESTER United’s Bruno Fernandes has been named Premier League player of the month for June even as Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo was named the manager of the month ahead of Manchester United’s Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Chelsea’s Frank Lampard and Newcastle’s Steve Bruce The Portugal playmaker has been an integral figure in United’s strong recent form, which culminated in a 3-0 win at Aston Villa on Thursday night as they became the first team in Premier League history to win four successive games by a margin of three or more goals. Since February 1, Fernandes has been involved in 13 goals for United – more than any other player during that period – and in June he scored three times as his team returned to action after the coronavirus suspension in superb form. United’s win at Villa Park moved them to within a point of fourth-placed Leicester, who they face on the final day of the season, as they target Champions League qualification for next season. Fernandes also won the goal of the month award for his volleyed finish at the end of a swift counter-attack in United’s 3-0 victory at Brighton on June 30. Meanwhile, Santo has dedicated his award to the club’s medical staff, saying: “We are pleased with the award, but as you know, the words are for all the group, especially for the medical staff who allowed us to return safely in a good way. “They are our true heroes because what they have done behind the scenes was huge for us and that was what made it possible for us to compete well in the return of the competition, so this reward is for them.”
