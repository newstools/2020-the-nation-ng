 THE Osun State Government on Thursday dispelled the rumour that another executive council (exco) member tested positive for the Coronavirus. It, however, said all exco member will be tested for the virus. Barely three days after the Secretary to the State Government, Prince Wole Oyebamiji, was announced to have tested positive to the virus, speculations indicated that a member of the exco tested positive. Speaking with our reporter on phone yesterday, the Health Commissioner, Dr. Rafiu Isamotu, urged the public to discountenance the rumour that an exco member tested positive. Isamotu said: “No other exco person tested positive other than the SSG. We are going to test our exco members.” He added that the SSG is getting better.
