Deshapeables is owned by Dr. and Mrs. Idowu, the wife was formerly known as Haolat Damilola Sarumi. Their brand is into weight loss products, making women feel very comfortable in their body. In an open challenge, Eniola Badmus, who is a Nollywood star, took to her social media page on Instagram on the 24th February 2020 to say: “If truly your weight loss pills and food work, use Eniola Badmus as a project… work on me and let the world see the progress. Stop using slim people to advertise weight loss food, pills etc.” Deshapeables saw this, accepted the challenge and reached out to her to welcome her on board on the 25th of June 2020 to prove that their products work. We look forward to her amazing transformations with Deshapeables. Asides, signing Eniola Badmus as a brand ambassador, Deshapeables has also signed over 10 other celebrities, which include one of the latest contestants of the just concluded Big brother Nigeria reality show Esther Agubiade, the popular and one of Nigerians top actress in the movie Industry Ini Edo and many more.
