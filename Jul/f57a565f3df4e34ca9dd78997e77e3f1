LIVERPOOL captain Jordan Henderson will play no further part in the champions’ bid for Premier League records with his knee injury ruling him out of the rest of the season. Klopp confirmed that the skipper will not be able to feature again this campaign, but will not require surgery and should be fit again for next season. He will also be there to lift the Premier League trophy against Chelsea on July 22 as the Reds finally end their 30-year wait to be crowned champions. “Hendo is the best possible of all bad news: it is a knee injury but no surgery needed,” said Klopp. “He will not play any more in the latter stages of this season but I am pretty positive he will start with us the new season. It was an awful moment when he went down with injury. In Germany, we would call him an animal as he deals with pain so well. “You saw he knew something happened which shouldn’t have happened. Everyone felt for him. It was a real mood killer. “We were all concerned when we saw him going down and he left the pitch and when we got the news it was a big relief for all of us. “It is not cool but it is the best we could get, Hendo is a quick healer and he will be back soon. “But he deserves to lift the trophy and he will lift the trophy.” Henderson is determined to come back stronger, writing on Instagram: “Of course it’s not the way I’d have preferred to have finished the season on a personal level. “I’m sure the lads will ensure we finish the season off on a high.” Liverpool host Burnley today looking to extend their long, unbeaten home league run stretching back to April 2017 to 58 league matches.
