 ONCE some politicians taste power, they want to remain in or around government because of the many benefits that come with it. But the same cannot be said of the immediate past governor of Bauchi, Mohammed Abubakar. Recently, Abubakar, who is a lawyer, was spotted in court working on a case. He looked like one who never took a break as he was cheerful among his colleagues in the chamber. He was first elected governor of Bauche State in 2015 under the banner of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). His attempt to return to office for another four years hit the rocks last year as he was defeated by the candidate of the Peopleâ€™s Democratic Party (PDP), Bala Mohammed.
