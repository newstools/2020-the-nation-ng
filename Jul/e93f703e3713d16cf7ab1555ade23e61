The Majority Leader of the Niger state House of Assembly has been sacked alongside his Deputy. Members of the house declared that they no longer had confidence in the leadership, hence their removal. The member representing Lavun Constituency, Honorable Jibrin Ndagi Baba raised the motion for the removal of the house leaders during the Thursday plenary. The Legislator said while moving the motion that, “after consulting with other colleagues on the issues affecting the house, we no longer have confidence in the house leader and his deputy. I therefore moved that the two officers should be removed.” Other members of the house supported the motion while they nominated other Honourable to occupy the position. Speaker of the House, Abdullahi Wuse, said he was not notified on the decision of the house to remove the House Leaders while he called for caution. Legislators however nominated the member representing Borgu Constituency, Honorable Muhammed Bala as the new house leader and Honorable Binta Mamman representing Gurara Constituency as the new deputy leader of the house.
