 The Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba-Akoko has planned a three-month online programme for students and members of staff to enhance their skills. This was made known in a memo posted on Connect with AAUA VC official Facebook page by Yinka Fadayomi, the university webmaster. The statement was signed by the Registrar, Mr. Opeoluwa Akinfemiwa. The university said it had acquired 5,000 licences from Coursera, a leading online training company based in the United States of America. “This is to inform all members of staff and students of the university that the university administration has put in place a three – month e-learning programme to enhance their skills during this period of the Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) lockdown. ‘’To this end, the university has acquired 5,000 licences from Coursera, a leading online training company based in the United States of America (USA) for free access to over 4,000 courses in 400 specialisations,” the memo read. The university management, however, said only students and members of the staff with official email address would be allowed to register for the training. “The administrative settings have been configured to allow only staff and students with the official email address to register. Interested staff and students are expected to register at www.coursera.org with their official email address and automatically have access to all the courses on offer at no cost,” it said.
