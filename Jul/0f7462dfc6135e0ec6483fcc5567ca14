THE Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs on Friday completed the screening exercise for the 42 non-career ambassadorial nominees sent to the upper legislative chamber by President Muhammadu Buhari a fortnight ago. Among those screened successfully are Mr. Oma Djebah, a former deputy editor of ThisDay newspaper, and Mr. Debo Adesina, a former editor of The Guardian. Ten others were also screened by the committee chaired by Senator Adamu Bulkachuwa from Bauchi State. Djebah was accorded the privilege of taking a bow before the committee. This was after a member of the committee, Senator James Manager from Delta State spoke glowingly of the credentials and qualifications of the senior journalist. According to Manager, Mr. Djebah had served as commissioner and senior advisor on foreign relations in Delta State, among other notable public assignments. He said given his antecedents and pedigree, he was happy to vouch for his integrity and competence for the post of an ambassador and therefore pleaded for the ‘take-a-bow’ privilege. Senator Manager’s position was corroborated by Sen. Orji Uzor Kalu who also vouched for the public service records and professional integrity of the nominee. The chairman of the committee accordingly asked Djebah to take a bow. Others ambassadorial nominees screened were Abubakar Ibrahim Siyi – Bauchi; Paul Ogar Adikwu – Benue; Jazuli Imam Galadanci – Kano; Dare Awoniyi – Kogi and Ibrahim Kayode Laro – Kwara. Others were Abioye Bello – Kwara; Zara Maazu Umar – Kwara; Nimi Akinkugbe – Ondo; Debo Adesina – Oyo; Folakemi Akinyele – Oyo; and Suleiman Sani – FCT. The screening exercise began on Wednesday after the Senate in plenary referred the communication from President Buhari.
