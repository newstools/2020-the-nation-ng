 All is not well with the relationship between two lovebirds, Diane and Elozonam. The re-union show on Tuesday night, which was Day 18, saw both of them venting anger at each other, with Diane insisting that their relationship did not work, and so they should move on. Diane explained that there was a time Elozonam’s fans insulted her, and he was aware, and he did nothing about it. She said there was a whatsapp group created where she was insulted. She further countered Elozonam’s claims the she was putting him as a second option, while in the house, and after the house. “I did not put you as an option.” Diane said. “I explained everything to you my relationship with Mauly, There was a time your fans insulted me, and you did nothing. Eloznam explained how Diane flirted with the guy and left him alone at the Big Brother Naija final party, and he was angry. Elozonam said “Everything that happened was a reaction. People called me to ask what happened, I ask, did you know what happened prior? “I did not have a situation ship with somebody. I have a bestie. I told you about it.” Diane accepted that there were distractions and that was why her relationship with Elozonam did not work, with Elozonam agreeing that there is no road with Disne There were discussions on whether Jackye liked Mike, but she talked a lot about her boyfriend, whom she said she loves because he is showing that he wants to change from his bad behaviours.
