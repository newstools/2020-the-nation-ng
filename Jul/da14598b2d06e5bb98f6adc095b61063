Super Eagles winger, Alex Iwobi could make it back-to-back season and three overall without being booked in the English Premier League if he avoids a caution on Sunday when Everton face Bournemouth in one of the final games of the season. Iwobi who was an unused substitute in the Blues 1-0 win against Sheffield United at Bramall Lane midweek has only received two yellow cards since he debuted for Arsenal during the 2015-16 season and he has played 126 league games and scoring 12 goals in the process after close to five seasons. The 24-year-old was last booked on the 22nd December, 2017 during the 2017-18 season against Liverpool at the Emirates in a thrilling 3-3 draw and his first caution happened against the same opposition a season earlier on the 14th August, 2016 in the opening game of the season which the Gunners lost 4-3 at home to the Reds. Iwobi managed to finish 2015-16 and 2018-19 seasons on a clean bill without any booking despite playing 13 and 35 games in both seasons respectively for the Gunners and having strived to prevent a booking until now, the Arsenal prodigy could stretch his clean bill record to three seasons out of career five seasons in the top-flight if he is able to hold his nerve and not get booked against Bournemouth on Sunday. At Arsenal, Iwobi played 101 EPL games and scored 11 goals with two yellow cards but at his new aboard in Everton he has featured in 25 games with a goal to his credit in his first season with the club.
