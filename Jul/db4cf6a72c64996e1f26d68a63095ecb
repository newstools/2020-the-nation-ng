Gunmen on Wednesday attacked a bullion van in Ebonyi State, killing four policemen escorting the vehicle. The gunmen tried unsuccessfully to intercept the van, which was conveying money from Enugu to Abakaliki, the Ebonyi State capital. The incident happened at Ezzamgbo Junction in Ohaukwu Local Government Area of Ebonyi State, police said. The robbers fired at the van in which the policemen were riding, killing four of them and injuring two others. Commissioner of Police Philip Maku confirmed the incident, saying that the robbers trailed the van from Enugu. He said the robbers were not able to loot the van as the driver managed to escape with the vehicle. “They damaged one of the tyres of the bullion van but the driver was able to escape with the van. They could not give chase as the driver was driving towards the military checkpoint ahead,” he said. The CP said the two injured policemen have been taken to hospital for treatment while the deceased have been deposited at the mortuary. Maku said the police have launched a manhunt for the fleeing robbers.
