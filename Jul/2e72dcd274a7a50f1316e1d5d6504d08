Founder of Divine Hand of God Prophetic Ministries International in Abuja, Emmanuel Omale, has threatened to file a suit against the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) for writing a report that he helped the suspended acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu, acquire a property in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates (UAE). NAN had published a report of the Presidential Committee on Audit of Recovered Assets (PCARA), which probed assets recovered by the EFCC from May 2015 to May 2020. In the report, Magu allegedly used Omale to launder funds. He was reportedly uncovered during an investigation on EFCC’s activities by the Nigeria Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU). According to the report, the cleric bought a landed property valued at N573 million in Dubai on behalf of Magu. In a letter by his lawyer, Gordy Uche (SAN), Omale described the report as malicious, derogatory and libellous. The letter added: “Our client’s attention has been drawn to the extremely malicious, derogatory and libellous publication with the caption – ‘How Magu Used “Pastor” to Launder Re-looted Funds Abroad – Report,’ posted on your website – www.nannews.ng on July 11, 2020. Omale is demanding N1 billion “as exemplary, aggravated, general damages for defamation, and for injunction, if you fail to comply”. “Further take notice that this letter constitutes our formal notice of intention to sue,” the latter said. Magu is currently being grilled by a panel President Muhammadu Buhari set up to probe the EFCC under his watch.
