The Oniru of Iru Kingdom in Lagos, Oba Gbolahan Lawal has warned those fomenting within Iru Kingdom to desist henceforth, or face severe punishment. Oba Lawal said nothing will be spared in protecting the lives and property of law-abiding citizens. The Oniru’s warning is coming on the heels of clashes over the weekend between officials of the palace and some residents of the Oniru estate. The son of a former monarch, Tijani Idowu Oniru was seen in a viral video molested by some local security men at the weekend. Tijani was alleged to have earlier led some men to attack the palace officials while on an official duty. The monarch warned residents not to take the laws into their own hands and prevented lawful activities within the estates. A statement from the palace said: “The monarch, irked by the affront of some social miscreants with the support of some influential members, who unleashed violence on palace officials who were on legitimate duties, said as a trained law enforcement officer and experienced public administrator, he is committed to ensuring that peace reigns in Iru kingdom and every resident and business owner should be excited at the better days ahead but warned that anyone found fomenting trouble or resorting to self-help in addressing selfish grievances, will have himself or herself to blame.” Oba Lawal assured residents and business owners to go about their lawful duties without any fear, reiterating his commitment to bring development and prosperity to the people, ending their long years of suffering in the midst of plenty. He added that the peaceful co-existence of all residents will not be allowed to be breached by anyone, no matter how highly placed.
