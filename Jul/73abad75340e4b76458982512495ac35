The Vice Chairman of the National Campaign Council on Communications and Publicity of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for Edo State governorship election, Patrick Obahiagbon, has accused Governor Godwin Obaseki of harassing APC members serving in elected offices over their refusal to join him in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Obahiagbon, addressing reporters on Wednesday in Benin, condemned Obaseki’s action, which he described as undemocratic, Machiavellian and depreciable intolerance that must be rejected by well-meaning Nigerians. He said: “The brazen resort to strong-arm stratagems, unbridled intimidation and macabre bludgeoning of APC members elected into government positions, simply because they refused to defect to the PDP along with the Edo governor, verges on depreciable intolerance. “It is unacceptable to us. We call on progressive democratic forces to condemn this anti-democratic act, oozing from the seat of government, in the strongest of terms. “A situation where our faithful party elected officials have been suspended from their offices and in some cases, their salaries withdrawn and at other times, forced out of office, is not only anti-democratic, but also palpably displays a resort to brute force, which must be repudiated by a coalition of progressive forces.”
