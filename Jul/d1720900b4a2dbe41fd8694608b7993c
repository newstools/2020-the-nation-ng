An art foundation, Vernacular Art-space Laboratory (VAL Foundation), has established a COVID-19 intervention initiative tagged: COVID-19 Pyramid Intervention. The initiative, the foundation stated, is to cushion the effect of the economic downturn caused by the pandemic for Iwaya/Makoko community According to it, most families in the communities are suffering from the negative effects of lockdown and imposed self-isolation by the government, the foundation “At VAL Foundation, we believe a moment like this art is important and could play a role in shifting peoples’ minds from depression and perhaps crime.  We hope to create the art of compassion with you and present it as a site-specific happening with a pyramid structure: You at the top, the needy in our community at the bottom. “A lot of small business owners have spent their capital on taking care of their families and we hope that giving Soft Fund to them will help bring them back to their feet. We are, therefore, reaching out to well-meaning Nigerians for support. We hope this might lessen the burden on people in Away/MacBook community with the following interventions: facemasks, food items, soft fund for small scale businesses i.e. N10, 000 to N20, 000, and condoms,” VAL Foundation founder, Aderemi Adegbite said.
