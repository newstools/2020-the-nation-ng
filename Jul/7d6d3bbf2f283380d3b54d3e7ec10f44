At the resumed hearing of the matter, the defendant’s counsel Mr. Ebun Adegboruwa, SAN, told the court that he had served all parties in the suit a motion to discharge the ex-parte order and an application to dismiss the Police’s motion on notice against the The defendant. But the bank’s counsel Mr. Seni Adio, SAN, said he had just been briefed of the matter and needed time to respond to the application. He prayed for a short date to enable him file a response. However, a Superintendent of Police (Supol) Justine Enang, who appeared as prosecutor in CSP Jackson’s place, told the judge that he had responded to the applications.
Justice Faji granted Adio’s prayer.
