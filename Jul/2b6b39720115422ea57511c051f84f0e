 The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has reconciled with the United Labour Congress(ULC) led by Joe Ajaero to form a united labour movement. The ULC broke away in 2015 during the delegates conference to elect new leadership for the NLC. President of NLC, Ayuba Wabba, broke the news to reporters at the end of a joint session meeting addressed by the two leaders of the unions on Thursday in Abuja. Wabba said with the reconciliation, the leadership of the ULC has been re-integrated into the NLC. Details shortlyâ€¦
