 Talk of any finance-related issues, Dr. Adesola Kazeem Adeduntan is ever ready to show his uncommon wizardry and class by proffering possible solutions. Despite bagging a first degree in Veterinary medicine from the University of Ibadan, settling into the finance field didn’t seem to rattle him. He started off his banking career at the now-defunct Afribank, where he was said to have displayed exemplary skills as a human resource manager, team player, boardroom guru, and seasoned technocrat. Many would wonder how, under his watch as the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, First Bank has flourished tremendously with new and innovative ways to easy banking. As a seasoned team player, taking glory for every success has never been his style. He has often ascribed every success recorded as a collective effort of his team. Over the course of his sterling career, the Master’s Degree in Business Administration (MBA), from Cranfield University Business School, United Kingdom, has garnered diverse expertise in Treasury and Financial Management, Risk Management, Accounting and Internal Controls, Corporate Governance, Corporate Strategy Development, and Implementation, Corporate Finance, Business Performance Management, Financial Advisory, Investors, Regulators and Rating Agencies Relationship Management, Deployment and Management of Information Technology, and Compliance. For his passion for quality education and raising giants, Sola, a member of the popular Sigma Educational Foundation, recently and successfully graduated 28 candidates in FirstBank Management Associates Programme (FMAP), virtually on June 30, 2020. The 28 graduates have been armed with a comprehensive developmental programme in the space of 24months.
