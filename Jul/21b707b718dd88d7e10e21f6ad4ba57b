  Kelechi Iheanacho has stressed that Leicester City are still on course for a top-four finish in the Premier League, throwing down the gauntlet to Manchester United. The Foxes have won just one of their last five games in the English top-flight since football returned in England owing to a hiatus caused by the coronavirus pandemic. A consequence that has seen them drop to fourth behind Manchester City and Frank Lampard’s Chelsea. Nevertheless, the Nigeria international stated that his King Power Stadium outfit can still finish above the Red Devils who have slashed their eight-point lead to one, claiming his side is unfazed by their red-hot form. “The race is on. Anyone can get into the top four, anyone can get into the top six,” Iheanacho told Sky Sports. “Bruno [Fernandes] is a top player. They’ve got Marcus Rashford and Paul Pogba back in the team now. “They’re flying. But that’s not what we need to worry about. We just need to focus on our games.”  Iheanacho also reflected on his time at Manchester City where he had the best goals-to-minutes ratio of any player in the English elite division, disclosing the lure of regular starts led to his £25m move to Leicester in 2017. “My Premier League debut was against Watford in 2015. I got a few minutes or so. It was truly heart-warming. So nice, being young and then scoring goals,” he continued. “There are young players doing well now and I’m happy for them, like Phil Foden and Mason Greenwood. You never know how it really feels until you start getting older and understand more. “Everybody wants to play. No one wants to sit on the bench.” With five goals from 17 games so far this term, the 23-year-old is expected to be on parade when Rodgers’ men take on relegation-threatened Bournemouth at the Vitality Stadium on Sunday evening, with the Cherries in dire need of a win to keep their battle against the drop alive.
