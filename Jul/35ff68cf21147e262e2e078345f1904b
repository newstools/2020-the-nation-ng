 THE Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 lamented  the  rise of positive cases of the virus among people in positions of authority. It said the development was  a threat to governance and security in the country. Chairman of the PTF, Mr Boss Mustapha, raised the alarm during the daily briefing of  the  task force   in Abuja on Monday. Noting that the rise in the number of prominent public officers and other highly placed Nigerians  that had tested positive for the virus   had further confirmed that COVID-19 does not discriminate,  Mustapha  charged Nigerians to be vigilant He, however, assured that  the PTF would step up its sensitisation strategy against the deadly  virus. His words: “Of recent, we have witnessed a high rate of positive cases, especially among people in authority. This has a direct impact on governance and security of our nation. “We urge that vigilance and care should be exhibited by all Nigerians irrespective of status. This virus does not discriminate and the PTF shall keep sustaining its sensitisation messaging. “The  PTF calls on all Nigerians to also remain vigilant and this call is underscored by global and national developments in the last one week, especially throughout the weekend. In the last one week, we have witnessed a resurgence in countries that were noted as having successfully contained or containing the spread of the virus. Mustapha, who is also the Secretary to the Government of the Federation  (SGF) said  the PTF yesterday  met with the heads of security   to   “chart a refined course in view of the fact that COVID-19 is a global health challenge.”
