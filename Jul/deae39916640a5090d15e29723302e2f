 SOME Boko Haram insurgents have asked a 75-year-old blind man, Jato Ndarfa, to pay N20 million before they free his daughter and niece kidnapped about two weeks ago in Borno State. Pa Ndarfa told journalists yesterday in Maiduguri, the state capital, that he could not raise the ransom, pleading that since his three wives went missing following a Boko Haram’s attack on their village in 2014, his daughter, Lami Jato, now 25, had been catering for the family. The septuagenarian fought back tears as he narrated the kidnap of the two women and a driver at a farm. “It was my daughter, Lami Jato, and niece, Renita Bitrus, who is married with two children, who were abducted by the Boko Haram 15 days ago,” he said. “I am appealing to them to have mercy on me and release my daughter, niece and the tractor driver. I am a poor blind old man at an IDP camp. There is no means of getting money to feed, let alone getting N20 million to offer. Please my children pity me and release the women who are also your sisters.” Pa Ndarfa also appealed to Governor Babagana Zulum to intervene. “I should not be allowed to die of frustration. The situation is terrible for me here,” he said.
