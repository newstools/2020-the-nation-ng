The President of the Driving School Association of Nigeria (DSAN), Mr. Jide Owatunmise, has sought quality drivers’ training. Owatunmise, in a statement issued on Thursday after a virtual meeting of the national executives of the association, said it was sad that Nigeria’s first female helicopter fighter pilot’s (Tolulope Arotile’s) death was traceable to the recklessness of a driver, who was not certified to handle a vehicle on the road. He condemned the circumstances of Arotile’s death.
