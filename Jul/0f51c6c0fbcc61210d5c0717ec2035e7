Al Sadd manager Xavi confirms he has tested positive for COVID19 and will be in self-isolation. The Span’s World Cup winner will miss his side’s return to competitive action against Al Khor tonight. He tweeted: A few days ago, following the @qsl protocol, I tested positive in the last COVID19 test. “Fortunately, I’m feeling ok, but I will be isolated until I am given the all clear. When the health services allow it, I will be very eager to return to my daily routine and to work.”
