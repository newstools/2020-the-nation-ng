 Toyin Abraham has secured another endorsement barely one month after her last endorsement with a health and fitness coy. The Africa Magic Viewers Choice Award winner just signed a deal to represent and promote the activities of top real estate coy Revolution Plus Properties. The real estate firm unveiled Abraham as its newest ambassador in an event that took place in the firm’s head office in Lagos, Nigeria. Abraham joins her colleagues, Odunlade Adekola and Omoni Oboli, as ambassadors of the real estate firm. Speaking on the new deal, Abraham said, “I’m really excited to start showcasing Revolution Plus Properties to the world. The company has been doing great things and also helping Nigerians with different humanitarian gestures.” On why she accepted the endorsement deal, the ‘Fate of Alakada’ star said, “I think why I accepted this deal is because they represent who I am and what I want to achieve and hence, we are doing this signing today which by God’s grace will be the beginning of better things to come. “Oftentimes when celebrities sign endorsement deals, people are happy for them because it seems to mean more money for the celebs alone. Yes, it is a lot of money for me ooo but we are sharing it together. And many #toyintitans will become house owners and be lifted up in their standards of living. This endorsement is a win-win for everyone. Let me start the win-win giveaway by picking people under Revolution Plus property and I will credit,” the actress and producer said. In his reaction, the CEO, Revolution Plus Properties, Chris Bamidele Onalaja, explained that Abraham was singled out because of her personality and what she represents in society. He also said she would be helping his organization energise and grow her social footprints and community with her positivity and also to establish an authentic connection with her clients and prospective ones.
