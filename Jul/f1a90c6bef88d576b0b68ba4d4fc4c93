The Oyo State Government has revealed that it would keep school open and allow pupils to continue learning despite Federal Government’s announcement that the WASCE examination would not hold in Nigeria. The Commissioner for Education, Science and Technology, Barr Olasunkanmi Olaleye told The Nation last night that the Federal Government’s decision would not make Oyo State Government reconsider its stand on school reopening and learning. He said the state was waiting for WAEC’s decision on the development. Olaleye said the Federal Government’s decision could deny Nigerian pupils the opportunity to participate in a regional examination which would help them compete anywhere in the world. He, however, expressed optimism that the Federal Government would dialogue with WAEC on the issue and find a truce. His words: “The school has resumed in Oyo State and we are observing protocols of COVID-19. We will continue to prepare for terminal examinations including WASCE. Learning will continue. Examination is an integral part of education. Five other countries are participating in WASCE. Hence, the certificate has international value. Refusal to participate means denying our children the opportunity to compete with their counterparts all over the world. “However, we believe that dialogue will prevail. We are waiting for WAEC’s position on this matter. We believe that the Federal Government and WAEC will dialogue and find a way out. Oyo State will keep the school open and learning will go on.”
