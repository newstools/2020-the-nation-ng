Sovereign Trust Insurance (STI) Plc recorded a significant growth of 51.5 per cent in its profit before tax totalling N819 million as against N540 million recorded in 2018, its Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Olaotan Soyinka has said. Soyinka, who made this known in a statement, stated that the National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) has approved the firm’s 2019 audited accounts. According to him, the result is coming on the heels of the recent pandemic that has affected the business environment globally with no exception to insurance in Nigeria. He stated that Gross Premium written in 2019 stood at N10.8 billion compared to the N10.5 billion written in 2018, a minimal 3.43 per cent increase. He said another outstanding highlight of the 2019 accounts which could be described as remarkable is the rise in the firm’s Profit After Tax to N503 million as against N344 million in 2018, a 46 per cent increase. He further stated that just as the firm grew its balance sheet in 2019, its claims payout also increased. Similarly, Soyinka said its paid net claims at N2.2 billion in 2019, as against N1.7 billion paid in 2018. He noted that this in a way underscores the firm’s claims paying ability resulting in a 23.59 per cent net claims expense. The total assets also grew by 18.5 per cent to N13.4 billion in 2019 from N11.3 billion in 2018. The shareholders’ funds also rose from N5.8 billion in 2018 to N7.7 billion in 2019, culminating into a 33.7 per cent increase, he added. The CEO assured that the firm is committed to meeting and surpassing the expectations and aspirations of its shareholders and stakeholders alike as the industry gravitates towards another round of recapitalisation.
