The Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC) workers’protest has entered its sixth day as efforts to resolve their complaints on welfare, wastage of resources and others proved abortive due to the disagreement between the Executive Secretary, Yewande Sadiku, and the agency’s staff union. The protest, which started on the July 9 at the NIPC Headquarters in Abuja, is still ongoing as the workers have locked the ES and management of the organisation out of the office premises since parties cannot come to a compromise. Among the complaints are wastage of resources on frivolous foreign trips, double standard and deliberate tardiness on all issues of staff welfare, poor understanding of public sector financial management among others. The union Chairman, Comrade Yusuf Mustapha, said every attempt by the workers had been met with lack of decorum, dishonesty and disregard from the ES and her team. He added that it was on record that avenues of civil negotiations and reconciliations had been exhausted by the union executive. According to Mustapha, the NIPC, in its 20 years, has never been so broken, demoralised and polarised. As a result, the union  has decided to save the commission. However, the Director Strategic Communication, Emeka Offor, said the management has always made staff welfare and development a priority. ‘’Major welfare improvements were initiated by management without being prompted, to stimulate productivity and ensure staff job satisfaction. This include the introduction of a productivity allowance that rewards staff when budget targets are met, a post service benefit scheme to provide for those who retire or leave after many years of service …, he added.
