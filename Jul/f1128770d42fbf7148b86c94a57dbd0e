 Air Peace management  yestersday said its pilots were not on strike. In a statement by its spokesman, Stanley Olisa,  the carrier said any information purporting that its pilots were on strike was not only unfounded, but also  orchestrated to portray the airline in bad light. The statement reads: “This is to categorically state that our pilots are not on strike and nothing can warrant such development.The public is advised to ignore such publication as our pilots have not downed tools. “Air Peace will continue to provide best-in-class flight services while observing the highest safety standards.”
