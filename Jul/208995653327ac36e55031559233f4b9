Regent of Ibule Soro in Akure South local government area of Ondo, Princess Moyinoluwa Falowo, has cried out over her continued stay in office due to inability to elect a new Monarch for the community. Princess Falowa said she wants to leave the throne to enable her continue her educational pursuit. Falowa, who spoke at the weekend, urged Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu to intervene in the selection process of a new monarch. She stated the reasons for the delay of a new Monarch were unexplainable, adding August 20, 2020 was slated for election of a new traditional ruler among candidates from the ruling family. Falowa said she was surprised the exercise was suspended indefinitely without any cogent reason. It was gathered seven persons have indicated interest in ascending the throne and obtained forms since June 2019. Princess Falowo ascended the throne in March 29, 2019 when it was declared vacant. Sources in the community said the delay was because only three out of the six kingmakers in the community were alive. The State Government, through Ministry of Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, was said to have approved the three living kingmakers to elect a new monarch. What caused the delay, according to the community members, was two lists of Warrant Chiefs selected from families of the three dead kingmakers. The Warrant Chiefs were to join in the selection process. Princess Falowa said the Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Lola Fagbemi, had been assuring her but without any sign of progress. She appealed to Akeredolu to intervene in the situation. But the Commissioner could not be reached for comments.
