The death of former Oyo State Governor, Abiola Ajimobi, has left a huge void in the lives of loved ones. This type of vacuum is always hard to fill. Fatima Ganduje-Ajimobi, who is married to the late governor’s only son, may be in the best position to explain the vacuum created by departure of her father-in-law whom she always referred to as father. It was learnt that Fatima’s love for Ajimobi was not different from her affection for her biological father, Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State, and she shared a lot of exciting memories with him. Fatima married Idris Ajimobi in March 2018 in a high society wedding that attracted the President Muhammad Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osibanjo. Ajimobi’s marriage was blessed with five children – four girls and a boy. But when the rumour of his death first surfaced online, Fatima was the first to quench it. She then reacted: “Thank you for all the messages but our father is still alive, Alhamdulillah. When it is our time we will die so wait first…” Fatima attended American University of Nigeria (AUN), Yola, Adamawa State and graduated with a first class degree in International and Comparative Politics.
