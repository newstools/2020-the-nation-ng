Respected rights crusader, Mr Femi Falana (SAN), was not paid N28 million or any sum to handle any case by the suspended Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) Chairman Ibrahim Magu. He also never prosecuted any case for the commission. This is contrary to a report with the headline:Â More trouble for Magu as new facts on re-looting of recovered funds emerge, published on our website on Saturday. We apologise to Mr Falana, who we hold in high esteem, for the story which our Online section unwittingly picked from the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). We hereby retract the story. We agree that the report imputed against Falana was false, and on realising that, we took the story down. We regret the damage the story would have caused him and apologise unreservedly to him.
