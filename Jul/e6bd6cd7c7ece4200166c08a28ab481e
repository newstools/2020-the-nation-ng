 THE Abakaliki Division of the Ebonyi State Magistrate Court on Thursday sentenced one Nwonu Emmanuel to prison for stealing church offering. The suspect, it was gathered, broke into a Catholic church in the city and made away with the offering money and proceeded to rob a woman of her phone and some cash. The suspect reportedly confessed to the police that he forced his way into St. Patrick Catholic Church in the capital city, broke the offering box and took the money amounting to N41,465. Emmanuel said, “I am really suffering and taking care of myself and my blind father. It has not been easy for me. I have no place of my own to stay. I was a driver and lost my job and since then, I have not found any other job to do”. Chief Magistrate A.C. Nwusulor sentenced him to 12 months imprisonment.
