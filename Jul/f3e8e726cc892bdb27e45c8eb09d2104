 Davido has continued to stay away from social media 35 days after he announced to his fans across the world that he’s decided to live his life and put himself first. The singer has remained incommunicado to many of his friends and colleagues after he announced that he changed his mobile phone numbers on June 3. Davido moved out of his Lekki mansion to a newly purchased apartment on Banana Island in the same month and has gone into hiatus. Sources disclosed that Davido moved into the new apartment with his only son and third child, David Adelek Jr, and fiance of nine months, Chioma Rowland. The Nation was reliably informed that aside from his domestic staff, Davido weaned down his team’s usual visit to concentrate on raising his son and making the best of family time with Chioma. Before his hiatus of over 35 days, Davido announced that he will be returning to social media after the release of ‘A Better Time,’ his third album, in July. However, there are rumours that the singer might postpone the proposed release of the third album. In June, Davido’s hit single, ‘Fall’ from his sophomore album, ‘A Good Time,’ was certified Gold in the United States of America and Canada.
