A governorship aspirant of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ondo, Chief Olusola Oke, has urged his supporters to disregard reports that that party has settled for indirect mode of primaries in the state. Oke said the report does not represent decision of the National Caretaker Committee of the APC. Oke, who spoke through the Director General of his Campaign Organisation, Barr. Kazeem Olanrenwaju, said it was
the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party that is vested with the power to take decision on the mode of primary election to adopt. He stated that it would be made public when such decision has been taken. Oke said it was not the duty of any government agency, individual or group regardless of their vested interest, to announce the decision on the adopted mode of primary chosen by the APC. According to him: “The NEC and the National Caretaker Committee of APC are yet to take decision on the mode of primary to be adopted expectedly, no official information as regards it has been made available to INEC, the public and gubernatorial aspirants on it’s platform yet. “It will interest the members of the public to know that the screening committee set up by the National Caretaker Committee asked all the aspirants so far screened the mode of primary (direct or indirect) they will prefer. All the aspirants except one are unanimous in their demand for direct mode of primary election. “We therefore call on our supporters, party members and members of the public to disregard the news. It was purposely planted to test the resolve of the members of the party and create confusion in Ondo APC.”
