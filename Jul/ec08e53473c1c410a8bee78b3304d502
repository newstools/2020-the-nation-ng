Nurse Adetola Alao, a medical staff at the Federal Medical Centre, Ebute-Metta who was reported missing days ago has been found. In a statement released by the Administration Director of the hospital, Dr. Henry Etim, following reports from the hospital management, the Commissioner of Police, Lagos State Command, Hakeem Odumosu mobilized his men to carry out investigations. This resulted in tracking her phone calls/conversations to a remote village in Osun State. Vehicles, personnel and logistics for the trip were later deployed by the hospital management. Entries have however been made at the Osun State Police Command and Adetola is on a return trip to Lagos.
