 A DYNAMITE explosion on Thursday injured a policeman and another person at a bank in Okeho, Oyo State, a day after robbers attacked the bank. Four suspects were lynched by a mob, two arrested by police, who lost one of their men to the hoodlums. The robbers blew up the bank’s security door with dynamite and entered the  strong room where they made away with cash, police spokesman Olugbenga Fadeyi said. When Commissioner of Police Nwachukwu Enwonwu visited the scene on Thursrday to assess the scene, a crowd of angry residents asked him to release the detained armed robbers to them. Enwonwu refused. Fadeyi said the crowd remained with the policemen as the CP appealed to them to keep a good distance to allow his men examine the premises but they were adamant. Another dynamite went off, injuring a policeman and someone in the crowd. Fadeyi said the mob attempted to attack the police who were ordered by the CP to leave the scene.
