 IN one minute, I will be free from the voices, from the pain, and from you,” wrote a woman, who wanted to take her life in Anambra State. Ifeoma Obiora wrote twice on her Facebook page, talking about her pain and saying “Nobody listened. Nobody cared.” Police located the middle-aged woman and said she was in a troubled marriage and was seeking divorce. She said, “In these moments before my departure, I feel more clarity than I have ever felt in my dull life. In one minute, I will be free from the voices, from the pain, and from you.” “Nobody listened. Nobody cared.” Police spokesman Haruna Mohammed said, “Although her problem is civil in nature, leaving her in that condition could lead to something else. The Area Commander has invited her and her husband for counselling.”
