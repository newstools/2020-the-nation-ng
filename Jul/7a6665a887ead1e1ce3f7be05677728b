 KANO State Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje on Thursday warned about  the “slight increase in the positivity rate of COVID-19”. He spoke with reporters in the Government House, Kano, saying there was a need for his administration to tighten the belt in its fight against the pandemic. The governor explained that although the death rate of the Coronavirus is reducing, looking at the epidemic curve, there was a rise in the number of active cases. He said in April, Kano State recorded 0.4 per cent positivity rate, after which it declined to zero per cent. “We have seen a little rise from 1.1 per cent to 1.7 per cent, and as at yesterday, we have recorded 1.6 per cent rate of prevalence. “This means the pandemic is still much around. And it shows we must increase our efforts in what we are doing; the areas of threats must be addressed,” Ganduje said. The governor said the state presently leads in COVID-19 test and will continue to do so to kick the virus out of Kano. He, however, noted that the most important thing is for the people to obey the COVID-19 safety protocols, which he lamented, they were not obeying. The governor warned there should be no celebration (festivities) beyond prayers on the Eid-el-Kabir day.
