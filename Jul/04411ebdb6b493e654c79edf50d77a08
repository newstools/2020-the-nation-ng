The prosecution in the trial of alleged kidnap kingpin, Bala Hamisu (aka Wadume) and six others tendered on Monday before a Federal High Court in Abuja six guns said to have been recovered from Hamisu by police officials. The guns consisting of AK 47 rifles and a pump-action were tendered through a prosecution witness, Samuel Habila, an Inspector of Police. Justice Binta Nyako admitted the guns as exhibits. Led in evidence by prosecution lawyer, Mrs. Yetunde Adeola-Cole, Habila told the court that Hamisu confessed during interrogation that he bought nine guns from one Babangida Musa and later sold four. The witness gave details of how Hamisu was arrested in Kano after soldiers assisted him to escape. He said, â€œI recognise seven of the defendants. I am in court this morning to narrate my findings regarding the case I investigated, involving the seven of them. Lawyer to one of the defendants M.I Tona told the court that his client was induced into making his statement, adding that his client was asked to implicate the soldiers in order to regain his freedom. Lawyer to another defendant claimed that his client was tortured into making his statement. Justice Nyako adjourned till July 15 for continuation of trial.
