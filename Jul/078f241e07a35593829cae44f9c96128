The Proprietor of Southern Atlantic Polytechnic Uyo, Pastor Bassey James, has appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari, Governor Emmanuel Udom and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to support private polytechnics in Nigeria. Bassey made this appeal while addressing some journalists during assessment of Southern Atlantic Polytechnic entrepreneurship development centre. He told the newsmen that the polytechnic has one of the best shoe- making facilities in the country. According to him, the school has the capacity to produce all kinds of shoes for general use and security agencies. He further explained the polytechnic had acquired machineries for production of palm oil, vegetable oil and others. According to the founder, “several hectares of land have also been acquired across Akwa Ibom state for palm produce, we are set for development especially in the areas of agriculture projects. We aim to be number one in Nigeria.” While thanking Buhari for closure of borders and ban on importation of palm oil and military shoes among others, he appealed for support for private polytechnics. He said:”Private polytechnics in Nigeria employ thousands of workers yet nobody is coming to our aid especially during COVID-19. We want to create wealth for our people by training the required manpower for economic growth and development.” James said except something urgent was done, many private polytechnics will be badly affected. Southern Atlantic Polytechnic Uyo is one of the accredited and approved private institutions in Nigeria. Emmanuel commissioned Southern Atlantic Polytechnic Entrepreneurship Development Centre in 2019. James, who is the secretary of Association of the Approved Private Polytechnics in Akwa Ibom, thanked the State Government for expansion of Airport road, saying that it would give investors more confidence.
