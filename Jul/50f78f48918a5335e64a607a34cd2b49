 DINO Melaye, former senator who represented Kogi West senatorial district, has a strong penchant for the arts, especially music. Before, during and after his stints in the National Assembly, he had regaled Nigerians with his ability to wax musical – especially when he desires to send a message to his political foes. But Sentry can now confirm that Dino’s love for music has now gone beyond mere interludes, especially on social media where he is fast establishing himself as a ‘skit maker of repute.’ In just a couple of weeks, ‘Dino the rock-star’ dropped not less than four ‘singles’ to send clear signals that he is in music to stay. And his performances were all laced with dance steps and enough drama. His first new one was the piece he rendered to celebrate the suspension of former All Progressives Congress (APC) national chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole. Likening Oshiomhole’s ouster to his own exit from the senate and the take-over of Kwara State from his political ally, former Senate President Bukola Saraki, Dino taunted the former APC boss to no end while dancing his heart out. He followed it up few days later with another single on what he described as the sorry state of APC in Edo State following the exit of Governor Godwin Obaseki. As if eager to complete a treble to stamp his metamorphosis, a few days ago he released a new ‘single’ to remind President Muhammadu Buhari of his earlier warnings concerning embattled EFCC boss, Ibrahim Magu, who is currently being investigated by a presidential panel. It’s beginning to look like what politics lost in his unceremonious sack from the senate, has become gain for the entertainment industry.
