Nollywood actor, Jude Chukwuka, has gotten the attention of controversial Nigerian musician, Naira Marley and a ‘token’ of N1 million. The ‘Castle and Castle’ actor got himself the fund after impressing Naira Marley for miming ‘Mafo,’ one of his hit songs featuring Young John. Chukwuka had shared a short video of himself singing along with Naira Marley on his Instagram page on Friday, July 3, with his 42000 followers. The video, which garnered 982 comments and over 81000 likes, impressed the Marlian president, who promised to give Chukwuka the sum of N1 million for singing along. On Sunday, July 5, Naira Marley took to his Twitter account to request for Chukwuka’s contact and pledging a sum of N1 million for his efforts. “I’ve got 1 million Naira for you here sir. Marlians please help find him,” the singer tweeted. While Chukwuka is yet to react to the pledge from Naira Marley, his colleagues have commended his youthful mind despite his age. Top Nollywood director, Niyi Akinmolayan was one of the industry practitioners that have worked with Chukwuka and have reacted to the development. “Lol on Castle and Castle set, Mr. Jude was always singing popular Naija music in a very entertaining way…he always knew the lyrics so well. I’m glad he’s winning this for just having fun,” Akinmolayan tweeted. Chukwka is the host of indigenous Yoruba TV show, ‘Owe ati Oro Yoruba,’ which made its debut in June 2020. The actor has featured in several Nollywood productions and TV series.
