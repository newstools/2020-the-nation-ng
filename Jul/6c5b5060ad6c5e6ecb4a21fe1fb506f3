 MEMBERS of the National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN), Ikorodu North Chapter have demanded that the Acting Rector of the Lagos State Polytechnic (LASPOTECH), Olumide Metilelu, step down following an investigation into a rape allegation against him. The youths made the demand during their protest at the Lagos State House of Assembly. The United Action for Democracy (UAD) petitioned the Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu over series of alleged sexual misconduct of Metilelu. NYCN coordinator Ganiu Nurudeen demanded speedy investigation into the matter. The protesters hailed the governor’s wife, Dr.  Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu and the Coordinator of Domestic, Sexual and Violence Response Team (DSVRT) Lagos State, Mrs. Titilola Vivour Adeniyi, for their swift response in making this matter see the light of the day. “We thank them both for their motherly role, and we repose even greater confidence in their avowed crusade,” Nurudeen said. The youth also marched to the governor’s office with a protest letter. Director, Office of Civic Engagement, Kolawole Hundeyin, who received their letter, assured them that justice would be served.
