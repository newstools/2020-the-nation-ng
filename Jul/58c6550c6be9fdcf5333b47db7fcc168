Massilia Motors, the sole distributor of Mitsubishi Motors, is set to host the live premiere of the New Generation Pajero Sport, a first of its kind in Nigeria. The launch, slated for July 31, will be a unique experience for attendees to witness a virtual unveiling of the New Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV) and an immersive 360-degree virtual tour. According to the company, “due to the C0VID-19 pandemic and social distancing measures, the brand opted for an innovative digital solution with a Livestream of the anticipated SUV launch. The aim is to keep hope alive with entertainment during these difficult times.” Redesigned with the theme, Elevate your Journey, the New Generation Pajero Sport was crafted to meet drivers’ desires for a perfect blend of comfort and functionality, while also possessing the off-road capability, reliability, and durability of the Pajero series, in a mid-size SUV. The launch will start with a press conference after which guests will be invited to take an intimate look at the Pajero Sport via a 360° virtual tour, followed by a Livestream music event and special guest appearances. The Managing Director/Country Delegate CFAO Nigeria, Thomas Pelletier, said the company had to adapt to the new realities faced with the COVID–19 pandemic, putting in place measures to ensure the safety of customers and staff members. He said: “The New Pajero Sport is tailored to suit the evolving needs of customers who desire advanced technology, more stylish and comfortable off-road SUVs. This virtual launch will be an exciting way to unveil the new model and above all, ensure all our guests are safe.”
