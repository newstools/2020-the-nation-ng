In line with strategic repositioning of the company, the management of Purple Group has announced the rebranding of Purple Capital Partners Limited and change of name to Purple. Also its flagship multi-use centre, Maryland Mall in Lagos will now be known as Purple Maryland while the ongoing development in Lekki is to be known as Purple Lekki. The decision, it said, was in line with the group’s core belief in continuous innovation and customer satisfaction. The Chief Executive Officer of the company, Mr. Olayide Agboola, who made the announcement in Lagos, noted the rebranding and repositioning takes effect from July 1. He also indicated the process would be implemented on all the company’s physical and digital touchpoints. Justifying the need for the new direction for Purple, Agboola explained, “We are refocusing our brand and extending our reach beyond just real estate development. We see the need to curate affordable lifestyle experiences by leveraging our expertise in real estate development. With MarylandMall, now Purple Maryland and our ongoing development with PurpleLekki, we are integrating retail, arts, entertainment, media and advertisement, family fun, food and drinks, e-commerce and financial services all in one through superior mixed-use centres and services.”
