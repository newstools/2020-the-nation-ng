Chinese Super League club Shanghai Shenhua have finally confirmed the signing of experienced Nigerian striker Obafemi Martins. The Super Eagles star was presented to the media and fans at a ceremony yesterday, which has ended speculation about his future after training with the club for several weeks. Shanghai Shenhua have brought in Martins as a replacement for Odion Ighalo, who has been farmed out on loan to Manchester United until January 2021. The former Newcastle United, Inter Milan and Wolfsburg star is returning to Shanghai Shenhua for a second spell, having first worn their colours from 2016-2018. Martinsâ€™ performances were pretty good in his first stint with Shanghai Shenhua, scoring 32 goals in 59 appearances while providing nine assists. For the 2020 season, the FC Ebedei product has been allocated the number 17 jersey, same number he previously used at Shanghai Shenhua. Apart from the aforementioned clubs, the 35-year-old Martins has played for Rubin Kazan, Reggiana, Levante, Seattle Sounders and Birmingham City.
