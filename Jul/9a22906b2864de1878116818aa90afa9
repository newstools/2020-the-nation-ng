Comic act, Mr Macaroni has featured the Ooni of Ife, His Imperial Majesty, Ooni Adeyeye Enitan Babatunde Ogunwusi in one of his latest skits. The comic actor had visited the monarch with BBNaija ex-housemate, Seyi Awolowo when he shot the skit. In the short skit, Ooni Ogunwusi couldn’t help but use some of Mr Macaroni’s favourite lines while promoting the Yoruba tradition of respecting elders. Speaking on the visit and cameo appearance, Ooni Adeyeye said, “Over the past four years of my ascension to the Throne of my forbearers, one of my core Royal mission has been to reconstruct the worldview of our young populations as I instill in them new cultural attributes through beliefs, values, practices, norms, tradition, heritage and understanding extraordinary corpus moments in African history. Over the weekend I was blessed to host some excellent youths that spent the weekend with me here at the Royal Court of the Kingdom of Ife (Ile-Oodua). It was an audacious moment of imprinting ambitious ideas for greatness in their minds as well as stemming up their spirit to share in my vision of re-writing our stories, celebrating in our ancestor’s achievements, and recording their challenges of the past for the generations ahead. Young people must never forget their culture and heritage, it is the greatest asset and wealth that we all must embrace.” Thanking the monarch, Mr Macaroni wrote, “Honor of my life to have spent an incredibly exciting and overwhelming day with the Alayeluwa, Arole Oduduwa, Olofin Adimula! His Imperial Majesty, Ooni Adeyeye Enitan Babatunde Ogunwusi ( Ojaja II ) The Ooni of Ife! He showed me so much love, I was speechless! Totally unbelievable! Thank you for this moment sir and for showing how ready you are to invest in the Youths! This for me is priceless!!! May your reign be long and prosperous! Kabiesi oooooooooooo.”
