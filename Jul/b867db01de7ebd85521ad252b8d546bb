    Come Saturday, August 1, award-winning music-comedian Kenny Blaq will thrill viewers as Owambe on Africa Magic comes to an end. Blaq will join Laolu Gbenjo and his band to thrill party lovers in the three – hour feature show created to fill the void of social gatherings. The show, which has been hosted by ace comedian, OAP and actor Yaw, has brought so much joy to homes. For nine weeks, it featured the best of music bands Owambe parties has to offer. The AM Owambe Saturday with Indomie will be sorely missed. The past few weeks since the lockdown has been a sore touchpoint for Owambe lovers. Content creators have had to introduce new ways to get people entertained. One of such amazing creations is the Owambe Saturday with Indomie by Africa Magic. This has helped fill the void created by physical distancing and by extension there’s a drastic cut down on Owambe parties.
