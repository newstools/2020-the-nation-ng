Roundnews, a media platform in Nigeria, has trained no fewer than 30 students from various African countries on entrepreneurship. The programme tagged “African Student Entrepreneurs Summit 2020” held via Zoom. The summit, with the theme “African Entrepreneurs and their impact in the development of the African Continent”, exposed the students to how they can use their skills as entrepreneurs in developing the African Continent. Roundnews Managing Director who is also a CampusLife reporter, Caleb Ijioma, said if Africans were united, the continent would develop faster. He said: “We came up with the idea and realisation that in our unity as Africans, we would be able to learn so much that can help our continent grow. The African Students Entrepreneurs summit 2020 was designed to serve the role of connecting and creating a platform to learn by young Africans. “It is important that we connect African students for the sake of learning and also to carve out possible ways to affect Africa for good. The summit was aimed at gathering African youths/students and helping them leverage on ideas, experiences and success stories of other young Africans.”
