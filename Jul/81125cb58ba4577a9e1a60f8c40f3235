 Popular comedian and skit maker, Ayodele Aguda aka MC Shem, is one of entertainers who has managed to keep his income flowing despite the ban on concerts and other forms of social gatherings. The comedian has explained how he took his game a step higher above his peers using the recent social media app – Tiktok – to relaunch himself and garner over four million followers in less than three months. The content creator disclosed that while many of his colleagues in the entertainment industry were counting their losses due to COVID-19 and social distancing, his stock grew even higher and translated to more money for him. During a recent interactive session, MC Shem revealed the secret behind his large social media following as well as his recent success. “As is done in business, I did an analysis by observing trends and what people were doing to command large followership. And I applied the insights to my Tiktok account. I checked pages of those who were already big on the platform and applied the insights,” he said. Speaking on how he has been unscathed during the lockdown and even making more money, the comedian added: “The good thing about social media is that it is not bound by time or place. I have made more money this (lockdown) period because there are more people at home to consume your content.”
