It is still not clear if Gaziantep FK head coach, Marius Sumudica would risk Nigeria international, Olanrewaju Kayode for their final Turkish Super Lig tie of the season against Yeni Malatyaspor tomorrow. Doctors gave Kayode the clearance to return to the pitch as from Saturday after he recovered from the knock that ruled him out of his clubâ€™s last two games against Kayserispor and Kasimpasa with both fixtures ending in draws. Kayode already played 27 games with 10 goals in the league alone and with the fact that Gaziantep are untroubled by relegation worries as they are placed ninth on the league table with 43 points from 33 games, it may not be necessary to field him if not fully fit. Reports monitored online indicated that the former junior international must pass a late fitness test to ascertain his fitness and enthusiasm to be involved in the final fixture of the season. Even though it is believed that the Turkish side are eager to make the deal of the Nigerian permanent from Shakhtar Donesk but nothing has been sorted yet and the striker is due back in Ukraine before the end of the month at the expiry of his loan spell.
