The Federal Government and Lagos State Government have sought the cooperation of motorists and residents on the partial closure of the Third Mainland Bridge which would last six months. Ahead of the closure of the bridge for maintenance work and expected to commence on July 24, the governments urged them to cooperate with the appropriate agencies. The Federal Controller of Works in Lagos, Olukayode Popoola; Lagos State Commissioner for Transportation, Dr Frederic Oladeinde; and Special Adviser to the Governor on Works, Aramide Adeyoye, made the appeal on Tuesday at a press conference in Lagos. They gave an assurance that the governments would put in place necessary measures to reduce gridlocks during the period. In his remarks, Popoola explained that there would be a diversion of traffic in two phases during the partial closure of the bridge between July 24 and January 24, 2021. He noted that Phase One of the diversion would last three months for repairs of the Oworonsoki bound lane of the bridge. According to the federal controller, the first stage will be for morning traffic from 12:00am to 1:00pm from Oworonshoki to Lagos Island on the Lagos Island-bound lane, while the afternoon traffic from 1:00pm to 12:00am will be from Lagos Island to Oworonsoki on the Lagos Island-bound lane. He added that the Phase Two of the diversion for the repair of the Lagos Island-bound lane of the Third Mainland Bridge would be for morning traffic from 12:00am to 1:00pm from Oworonsoki to Lagos Island on the Oworonsoki bound lane. Popoola stated that the afternoon traffic from 1:00pm to 12:00am would be from Lagos Island to Oworonsoki on the Oworonsoki bound lane. He said the government was aware of the inconveniences the maintenance of the bridge might cause motorists, promising that appropriate agencies for traffic control would direct and help traffic movement in the affected areas and alternative routes.
