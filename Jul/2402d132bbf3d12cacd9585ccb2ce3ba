 THE University of Port Harcourt (UNIPORT) in Rivers State has dismissed reports of recruitment of academic and non-academic workers into the institution. Its Public Relations Officer (PRO) Samuel Kpenu said an online publication, which asked members of the public to apply for jobs in the institution, was fake. Kpenu said the university had not advertised for job vacancies and was not responsible in creating the online job portal. He added: “The attention of the University of Port Harcourt has been drawn to an online publication purportedly asking members of the public to apply for academic and non-academic jobs in the University of Port Harcourt. “The authorities of the university wish to state categorically that the university has not advertised for any job vacancies “The website created for an online application for employment did not emanate from the University of Port Harcourt. “Consequently, the public is hereby advised not to patronise the so-called online recruitment exercise as it is the handiwork of fraudsters to smear the hard-earned reputation of the University of Port Harcourt. “Please, disregard the fraudulent online portal/site. For the avoidance of doubt, the University of Port Harcourt disseminates information from the institution to the public through its official website (www.uniport.edu.ng) and national dailies.”
