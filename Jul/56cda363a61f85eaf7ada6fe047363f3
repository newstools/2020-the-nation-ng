 Former Lagos Commissioner for Information and Strategy Dele Alake has denied interest in the vacant Lagos East senatorial seat.
The former occupier, Senator Adebayo Osinowo, died on June 15. Alake described his purported interest in the seat by a soft sell magazine as false and a figment of the imagination of mischief makers. “It is a lie from the pit of hell, “the former commissioner told The Nation in an interview.  He said he has never indicated interest in the seat. He said that he has never discussed the matter with anybody and wondered where the publication got its report from. “lt is junk journalism. The magazine broke the cardinal rule of journalism by not speaking with me to confirm what it heard or was told. This is highly unprofessional,” he said.
