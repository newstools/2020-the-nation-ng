 THE police in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, have killed the leader of the ‘One million boys’ gang and most wanted criminal, Biola Ebila. Police spokesman Olugbenga Fadeyi confirmed the death of Ebila yesterday in Ibadan in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). Fadeyi, however, said he did not have the details and manner in which the deceased was killed. He said: “Information reaching me from the Divisional Police Officer, Idi-Arere, showed that his body and that of his colleagues, who confronted the policemen strategically deployed in that axis, were brought with a tricycle to Kudeti. “At that instance, two of their members were also arrested, so they retrieved and brought the bodies to the station. “He has been on the wanted list of the police and the police have been trailing him. “What actually transpired and details on how he was killed, I don’t have them now, but he has been confirmed dead.’’ NAN reports that Ebila, who had been on the wanted list of Oyo State Police Command, was reportedly killed around Olomi area of Ibadan. The deceased was declared wanted by the command for alleged involvement in the murder of another Ibadan gang leader, Ekugbemi, on May 12.
