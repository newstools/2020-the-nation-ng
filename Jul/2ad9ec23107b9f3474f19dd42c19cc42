An Army officer attached to the 353 Artillery Regiment, Ojo Barracks, Lagos, was on Sunday, reportedly shot dead by suspected bandits, along the Okene-Lokoja highway. Capt. GSM Abubakar, with army number N/13600, was said to be traveling in his Honda Accord car when he ran into a blockade mounted by the armed bandits. An unconfirmed source said that Abubakar was traveling from Lagos to the Armed Forces Command and Staff College, in Jaji, Kaduna State, to participate in 2020 junior officers course. He was said to be in the company of his wife and mother when the incident happened. The bandits were said to have opened fire on the officer, who was dressed in mufti, killing him on the spot. They thereafter abducted his wife and mother. Other officers traveling in other vehicles behind him narrowly escaped the attack. They were said to have maneuvred their ways and sped away from the scene. The officerâ€™s remains moved to the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) Lokoja were on Tuesday claimed by the family for burial in his hometown, in Niger State.
