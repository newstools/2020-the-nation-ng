One thousand, six hundred Persons Living with Disability (PLWD) in Kwara State will benefit from the Federal Governmentâ€™s three-month special public works programme. State Committee Chairman Oluwasegun Oyewo, after an interactive meeting with leaders of the Joint National Association of Persons with Disability (JNAPD), said the number represents 10 per cent of the 16,000 beneficiaries in the state. He added that 1,000 beneficiaries would come from each of the 16 councils. Beneficiaries should be between 18 and 50 years, literates (20 per cent) and 30 per cent women. Oyewo said beneficiaries do not necessarily have to be indigenes, but residents, adding that services to be rendered by them do not require any special skills. According to him, the programme would run from October to December, and beneficiaries would get N20,000 monthly. Emir of Ilorin Alhaji Ibrahim Sulu-Gambari, represented by Malam Salihu Balogun, hailed President Muhammadu Buhari for providing jobs for 774,000 youths through the scheme, which he described as laudable.
