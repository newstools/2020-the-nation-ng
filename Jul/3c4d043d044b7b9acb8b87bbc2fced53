Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola said Leeds boss Marcelo Bielsa will be an “incredible” addition to the Premier League next season. Bielsa has masterminded Leeds’ return to the English top-flight after a 16-year absence. The former Marseille, Lazio and Argentina boss brought the Elland Road outfit their first silverware since 1992 as they clinched the Championship title on Saturday. Guardiola has often praised the 64-year-old in the past and he is excited to see the impact the Argentine can have on the Premier League.  “I was lucky to sometimes have the opportunity to talk with him, to see him. For world football, with his ethics, behaviour, the special way he plays – he is an authentic manager,” Guardiola told reporters. “No other manager can play the way he plays. His product is always incredibly personal. No-one can imitate him. That makes him so special.” Despite being widely admired for his commitment to a high-tempo, attacking style of play, Bielsa has not been a regular winner of silverware.
