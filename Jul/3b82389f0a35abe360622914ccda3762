MultiChoice Nigeria, has introduced an auto-renewal payment option for its DStv and GOtv customers. All active and inactive customers on both platforms will now be able to pay and renew their subscriptions automatically by downloading either MyDStv or MyGOtv App, and follow the instructions when they log in. Justifying the need for this initiative, the Chief Customer Officer, Martin Mabutho said, it was in respond to customers’ yearnings. “We have created and acquired content to ensure that our customers are sufficiently entertained. And with the return of live sports and the most anticipated show in Africa, Big Brother Naija, this is a great way to ensure that customers don’t experience any disruption while watching their favourite shows and never have to miss a thing,” said Martin Mabutho.
