Zinedine Zidane is six games away from winning his second LaLiga Santander title as Real Madrid coach, and his eleventh trophy overall. Compared to his first title on the Real Madrid bench, the way he may win it is also different. The Real Madrid now are completely different to the Real Madrid in 2016/2017. From a forward thinking attacking unit, to one which is focused on protecting their goal. Zidane’s only LaLiga Santander title was based on Cristiano Ronaldo and the 106 goals Los Blancos scored during that campaign. The 41 goals against mattered little, and is almost double the number conceded this season. That team was an offensive machine and that is how they won the LaLiga Santander title. Now the opposite is true. Zidane has flipped the script and exploited his team’s main strength in order to fight for the title. Without Cristiano and having issues in front of goal, despite the offensive arsenal in the squad, the leading role has gone to the defence. Real Madrid have scored just 60 goals in 32 LaLiga Santander matches – 46 less than 2016/17 – but have only conceded 21 goals – 41 in 2016/17. As such, this has allowed Zidane to capitalise on the fewer goals scored. The 1-0 win against Espanyol is testament to this.
