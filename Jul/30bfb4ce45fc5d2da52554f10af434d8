 Aruna Quadri  at the weekend won his fifth consecutive Portuguese league title after leading Sporting  Lisbon  to beat his former club, GD Toledos 3-0. The  two-leg final of the Portuguese national league final was  held at the High Performance Center of Vila Nova de Gaia and  this 37th title for Sporting was secured by Aruna alongside compatriot Bode Abiodun and Portuguese international, Diogo Carvalho. It was an emotional game for Quadri being his farewell match for the club he joined in 2016 and earlier claimed the Portuguese league, cup and super cup titles. Following their 3-0 first leg win, Quadri won with the same identical margin on Sunday to emerge the champion for the season on a very impressive note. From the 18 league matches played this season, Sporting were unbeaten dropping only five sets in all their matches to attain 70 points which is 22 more than second-placed GD Toledos. “One more time, we are champions of Portugal,” an emotional Aruna told NationSport. “After a good five years playing for Sporting, Sunday  was my last match for Sporting  and I am very happy with my stay with the club. “I want to thank the doctors, president, physiotherapists, teammates, coaches and fans as well as supporters for the unlimited support.”
