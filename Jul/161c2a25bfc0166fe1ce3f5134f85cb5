 SUPER Eagles duo of Wilfred Ndidi and Kelechi Iheanacho’s Champions League ambitions suffered a damaging blow on Sunday as Leicester City lost 3-0 to Tottenham in a premier league clash on Sunday. Harry Kane scored twice  in three minutes after Son Heung-min first goal to boost their hopes of European football next season while putting the Foxes’ top-four ambitions in the balance. Iheanacho was in action for 59th  minute before he was substituted for Ayoze Perez while Nampalys Mendy replaced Ndidi in the 70th minute but their efforts were not enough to save the Foxes from the defeat. Iheanacho’s curled attempt in the encounter was saved by Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris who also produced a good save to deny Demarai Gray’s deflected free-kick. Leicester might also be looking at Europa League qualification after a loss that hands Manchester United the impetus in the race for the Champions League as they remain level on points, but with United still having two games to play. The Nigeria internationals and their colleagues will be watching Manchester United clash against West Ham on Wednesday with eager eyes.
