Lady Ifeoma Ekwueme, widow of former Vice President Alex Ekwueme, is leading other women to drum support for former Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Prof Chukwuma Soludo. The women under the aegis of Anambra Demands Solidified (ADS) are from the 16 Communities in Orumba South in the State. They said the 2021 Governorship race will not be all- comer affairs in Anambra but for those who have the well being of the people of the State at heart like Soludo. The women made the appeal at Oko at the weekend, during the stakeholders meeting. Mrs. Ekwueme recalled how Soludo’s intervention in facilitating the release of funds during his tenure as CBN governor, fast tracked the rehabilitation of the once deplorable Ekwulobia-Ufuma- Umunze- Ibinta road which resulted in easier movement of people and goods and improved economic activities in Orumba. The women resolved to take the message of ‘Soludo for Anambra 2021 Project’ to the towns and villages in the local government . Mrs. Ekwueme also urged Ndi- Anambra to ” rise above party politics , religion , money and actualise a decision that would make their children and grand children to be proud of them.” Finally, they agreed to reach out to Soludo to accept their request in addition to his leading a crack team of technocrats envisioning the future of Anambra state for the next 50 years.
