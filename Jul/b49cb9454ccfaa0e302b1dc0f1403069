Students in primary six, JSS3 and SSS3 in Oyo State will on Monday resume at their various schools. Schools are billed to open for three hours, between the hour of 8 am and 12 noon, with students in boarding houses expected to have returned to their hostels on Sunday. Recall Governor Seyi Makinde had on March 21, ordered the closure of all schools in the state. Also, Assemblies are expected to be limited in schools such that there are two meters of physical distancing whenever the congregation of students and staff becomes necessary. State Commissioner for Education, Science and Technology, Mr Olasunkanmi Olaleye, had in a statement, on Sunday, assured that the state government had taken necessary steps to ensure safe resumption for students today. He, however, sought the cooperation of parents by providing facemask for their children/wards on a daily basis. Despite assurances of the state government, schools are being reopened amid fears of some parents and other stakeholders about the difficulty in students avoiding physical contact, the sustainability of asking students to wear a facemask for hours and days and maintaining social distancing.
