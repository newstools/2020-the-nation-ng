 ARSENAL manager Mikel Arteta  said Bukayo Saka is the only person to decide  on his international career, adding he can only offer his advice when consulted. Arsenal’s talented teenager has represented England up to under-19 level, but now the Londoner is being courted by Nigeria, where his parents came from. “If I get asked the question then I can give my opinion,” Arteta said. “He hasn’t come to me with that so for now I will leave it totally independent with the player and his family as they normally have a big say with their background, their culture and where they are coming from. I don’t want to step in there. “Absolutely [he is good enough to play for England] – and he’s very clever to make the right decision, as well.’ Saka, 18, told Sky Sports: “It’s a tough choice. I’m happy to have represented England at youth level but I’m also proud of my Nigerian heritage from my parents.
