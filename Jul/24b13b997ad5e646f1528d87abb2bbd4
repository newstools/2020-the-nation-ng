 THE former Minority Whip Leader of the House of Representatives, Mr. Samson Osagie, has expressed optimism that the All Progressives Congress (APC) will regain Edo State on September 19. He predicted an overwhelming victory for the party’s candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, at the polls. Osagie, who spoke yesterday with reporters at the APC national secretariat in Abuja, said the defection of Governor Godwin Obaseki to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) would not stop APC from regaining the state. He said: “As at today, the clamour for change of government in Edo State is high and we are confident that on September 19, APC and its candidate will win the election.” The ex-lawmaker said Obaseki’s victory at the polls in 2016 was not based on his political antecedent, but because of the outstanding performance of his predecessor.
