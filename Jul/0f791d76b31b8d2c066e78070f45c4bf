Is it true that Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo state extracted promises from some All Progressives Congress (APC) governors that they will openly support his candidature against Osagie Ize-Iyamu, before he dumped the party for the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)? And is there any truth in claims in some quarters that a number of APC governors were actually waiting for Obaseki to pick the ticket of the PDP before subtly pitching tent with their colleague governor ahead of the September election? Well, whatever the truths about these claims are, it appears any hope of Obaseki getting open support of any APC governor may not materialize. Sentry’s sources who should know says that the decision of President Muhammadu Buhari intervention in the lingering crisis within the APC may have nipped in the bud plans by some governors to back Obaseki against Ize-Iyamu. And recent moves by a Southwest governor to revive the plot was said to have been reported to the President by a governor from the Northeast. “The President simply directed that all APC governors should go and pledge support for the party’s candidate,” our source added. No doubt, Obaseki’s loss here is Ize-Iyamu’s gain.
