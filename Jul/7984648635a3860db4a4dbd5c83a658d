The Erelu Kuti of Lagos, Dr. Abiola Dosumu, has urged warring parties in Iru land to sheathe their swords and allow peace to reign. The Erelu, who made the appeal on Wednesday in a statement, said she had followed with utter dismay and pain the occurrences that have arisen in Iruland in recent times, stressing that she would be guilty of disservice to the kingdoms of Lagos if she didn’t lend her voice with those calling for peace. “As the Erelu Kuti of Lagos-the Queen mother, mother of royalties of the kingdoms of Lagos, who has been enthroned since 1974, over 40 years ago, I am honoured and legitimately bound to sue for peace. “I have learnt from our grandfathers with whom I was privileged to sit, rule and acquire great knowledge with wisdom. The Almighty in His great mercy has preserved my life till today to continue to interact with the current generations of Obas, who exhibit even more progressive agenda. And if I do not lend my voice with those calling for peace, I shall be guilty of disservice to the kingdoms of Lagos,” she said. Erelu said ascension to thrones in Lagos has since ceased to be transition from father to son, except for some extreme exceptions, adding that it has always been by rotation of various family branches.
