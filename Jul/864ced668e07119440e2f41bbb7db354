Edo State indigenes in diaspora are supporting the re-election bid of Governor Godwin Obaseki and his deputy, Philip Shaibu, on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The indigenes, through the Coordinator of a Europe-based socio-political pressure group, Edo Diaspora Front of UK, Jolly Iguodala, during a solidarity walk to the Nigeria High Commission in London, hailed Obaseki for his strides and commitment to peace and good governance. They noted that the re-election of Obaseki and Shaibu would give the administration the opportunity to consolidate its sustainable development drive across the 18 local governments. The group stressed that the walk tagged “Thank You Obaseki for Liberating Edo People from the Shackles of Darkness”, was in support of Governor Obaseki’s giant developmental paradigm. The indigenes noted that the re-election of Obaseki and Shaibu would consolidate the achievements recorded in their first tenure, stressing that Edo was in safe hands under Obaseki.
