The people of Ibadan are grieving. The Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Saliu Adetunji, is also grieving following the demise of Chief Bode Akindele, Parakoyi of Ibadanland. Describing the chairman, Madandola Group, as an astute businessman and entrepreneur of note, Oluibadan said: “Even though a man who lives up to 82 can be said to be advanced in age, when people mourn their losses, it is because the vacuum left behind by them is always difficult if not impossible to fill.” Akindele’s love for his people was there for everyone to see. According to Oloye Lekan Alabi, Sir Bode created opportunities not only for Ibadan people but for the Yoruba race and Nigerians as a whole. He stated: “He had a cordial relationship with Olubadan and his people. Since he died on Monday, each day, I write about him because of the relationship we shared for 36 years. He will be remembered for good by the people of Ibadan.” The founder of the Bode Akindele Foundation was renowned for his philanthropy, which spanned several decades.  His business empire, Modandola Group Of Companies, was named after his mother, which translates to ‘God, if you give me the wealth, give me a child that can take care of it.’ Akindele has chains of businesses making waves in Ibadan. Through these businesses, he became a major employer of labour in the city. Among the subsidiaries of the Madandola Group are Standard Breweries, Diamond Foods Ltd, United Beverages Ltd, and Associated Match Industry.
