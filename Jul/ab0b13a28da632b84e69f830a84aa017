Anambra State government has begun contact tracing at the College of Health Sciences, Nnamdi Azikiwe University Nnewi, following the death of its provost, Prof. Onochie Udemezue, of COVID -19 complications. A memo obtained by The Nation on Wednesday from the state government said workers at the administration department, where the late professor’s wife was working, are on self-isolation already, following the discovery that Udemezue died of COVID -19. The government blamed the late professor for being the architect of his death for resorting to self-medication in treating the virus. The late provost died about a week ago of diabetes and COVID-19-related complications. The memo to Governor Willie Obiano by a senior government official, who wished not to be mentioned, was titled: “Undisclosed facts about how Prof. Udemezue, Provost of Nnamdi Azikiwe College of Health Sciences, died of COVID-19”.
