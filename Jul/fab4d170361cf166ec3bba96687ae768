 Afro-pop singer, Oluwatoyin Ogunmuyiwa aka Smallz Tha Razor (STR), is currently counting his blessings with the release of his latest song, Juwonlo, featuring Bella Shmurda. STR who is the founder of the STR Nation may have released Juwonlo but the song has caught the attention of many music lovers, especially during the lockdown that kept many people at home hence the success the song has recorded in the last one month. The singer during a recent brief interaction hinted that music has grown from being a career or passion to being a life-support system for him, adding that making music dropping hit songs back to back has now become a part of his life that he can’t do without. Having started music officially in 2011 as an undergraduate student of Sociology at Lagos State University (LASU) STR realised what he wanted out of life at an early stage and has remained truthful to his dreams. In December 2019, STR showed the industry a glimpse of what to expect from him when he dropped his Extended Play (EP) that earned him recognition and award nominations across the country, saying “The EP prepared me for 2020 and I am happy that I am living my dreams this year despite the pandemic.” Juwonlo, his latest song may be topping music now but STR is not a new name in the industry as he has a track record of hit songs such as Greatness in which he featured Terry Apala, Musa, Shanawole, Lock Down, 16 Barz, Orita Fogo among others. He added that he’s working tirelessly to put out more quality sounds and his old and new fans with collaborations and singles also in the works.
