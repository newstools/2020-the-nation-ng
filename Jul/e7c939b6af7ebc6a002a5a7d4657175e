A Federal High Court in Abuja has turned down the bail applications by suspected kidnap kingpin, Hamisu Bala (Wadume) and six others being tried for kidnapping and related offences. In a ruling on Wednesday, Justice Binta Nyako granted accelerated hearing in the case and ordered that the defendants be immediately moved from the custody of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad of the Nigeria Police Force (where they are currently being kept) to the Kuje prison where their lawyers could have easy access to them. Justice Nyako equally ordered that the defendants be afforded access to medical facilities. Wadume was first arrested in Ibi, Taraba State, on August 6, 2019, by policemen from the Intelligence Response Team of the Inspector General of the Police office. Earlier, the prosecution called two witnesses, who testified and gave details of how a team of soldiers, led by Captain Tijani Balarabe attacked the police team that had earlier arrested Wadume in Ibi, a community in Taraba State.
