 EKITI State Government has begun recruitment of personnel into its security network called Amotekun Corps. Governor Kayode Fayemi in March signed into law a bill backing the establishment of the network aimed at ending kidnapping, killing and other crimes. The Commander of the Amotekun Corps, Brig.- Gen. Joe Komolafe (rtd), who addressed reporters on Wednesday in Ado-Ekiti, said the forms are free for eligible residents. He urged people between 18 and 60 years with educational qualifications from the minimum of Primary School Leaving Certificate and above to apply online. Komolafe advised applicants to download the application form online at www.amotekun.ekitistate.gov.ng and get endorsement letters from their monarchs affirming their indigene-status.
