 NOVAK Djokovic and his wife have tested negative for the coronavirus, his media team said yesterday, 10 days after announcing that the couple had contracted the disease. The top-ranked tennis player tested positive for the virus after playing in an exhibition series he organized in Serbia and Croatia amid the pandemic. No social distancing was observed at the matches in Belgrade and Zadar, Croatia. “Novak Djokovic and his wife Jelena are negative for COVID-19. That was shown by the results of the PCR tests that both had in Belgrade,” his media team said in a statement. Both Djokovic and his wife had no symptoms and were in self-isolation in the Serbian capital since testing positive, the statement said. The news comes amid a new spike of coronavirus cases in Serbia and the reintroduction of some restrictive measures, such as compulsory wearing of masks and social distancing. Djokovic was the fourth player to contract the virus after participating in the matches in Belgrade and Zadar. The others were three-time Grand Slam semifinalist Grigor Dimitrov, Borna Coric and Viktor Troicki. Djokovic’s coach, Goran Ivanisevic, has also said he has the virus.
