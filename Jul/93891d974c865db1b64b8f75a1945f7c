Senator Magnus Abe has described politicians wishing him dead as evil and undemocratic, saying it was time to stop such negative mindset and focus on development. Abe, who represented Rivers South-East Senatorial District at the National Assembly, asked such individuals to play politics of progress and prosperity instead of focusing on physical or political death and burial of anybody. Abe, in a statement by his spokesperson, Parry Benson, observed that different publications in recent times, sponsored by his political opponents announced his physical death and burial. He wondered why some politicians chose to focus on the death and burial of their opponents instead of concentrating on the progress and prosperity of the nation. He said: “This kind of burial without end has become shameful to those who conceive and imagine these negative thoughts. “Every day you bury Senator Abe in the morning, by evening you are shouting about the same man you buried in the morning and then you bury him again and again” He added: “It got to the point where a coffin with Senator Abe was carried on life television in Bori and buried, yet Senator Abe is still here. “The purpose of our politics should not be the burial of anyone. It should be about the progress and prosperity of our nation. “I represent the truth, the truth does not die and so it can never be buried. Real people cannot bury the truth, hirelings, with real names or pseudo names cannot bury the truth”. “Let us focus on what is real; change is always a painful process. But change must come”.
