A Federal High Court sitting in Warri has charged one Paul Tuoma Okene, a distributor of Nigerian Breweries products in Delta state, for illegal possession of arms and ammunitions. Okene, 61 and a native of Eku in Ethiope East council area of the state, was arrested by policemen attached to Zone 5 headquarters in Benin City, after a pump action, one double barrel gun, and 38 live cartridges were recovered from his homes at Warri and Eku on June 26 and 30, respectively. The information filed by the Police against the said Mr. Okene, is dated July 20 with charge number: FHC/WR/64C/2020: Inspector General of Police versus Paul Tuoma Okene. It contains a four-count charge stated as follows, “possession without license or authority one pump action gun number RICOL 15-0829 and thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 27(1) (a) (i) & (iv) of the Firearms Act, Cap F28, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004. “Possession without license or authority, 36 live cartridges and thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 27(1) (b) (ii) & (v) of the Firearms Act, Cap F28, LFN 2004. “Possession without license or authority one double barrel gun number OJKAL 15-9191 and thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 27(1) (b) (i) & (v) of the Firearms Act. “And possession without license or authority two live cartridges”.
