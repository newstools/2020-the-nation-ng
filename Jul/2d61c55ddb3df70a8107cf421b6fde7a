The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Edo State chapter, has warned leaders and members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) against accusing its members of destroying the campaign billboards and posters of Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu. Edo PDP, on Sunday at a news conference in Benin by its Publicity Secretary, Chris Nehikhare, told APC members to look inward over the destruction of the campaign billboards and posters. It said: “PDP or Edo State Government has no hand in the destruction of billboards and posters of APC and its governorship candidate. We condemn the act. “We advise APC members to look inward, as it is common knowledge that APC is seriously divided, populated by thugs and brigands in the many factions that exist within it. “Edo people have not forgotten how APC members resorted to bombing one another’s homes, as they battled for their governorship ticket. Edo people have also not forgotten the treachery, blackmail, threats and counter-threats employed to arrive at their predetermined governorship candidate. “The quality of the messages on Edo APC’s billboards and posters exposes the party as empty and having nothing to offer or motivate people of the state.”
