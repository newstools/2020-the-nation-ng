An international non-government organisation (NGO) AWP is targeting 50,000 women in a programme which will help them achieve financial independence. Tagged: “Digital Response:  The AWP Network Vendor Programme – The way forward,’’ the  founder, African Women Power (AWP), Ms Mary Olushoga, said the initiative aims to accelerate the growth of  women-led enterprises in West Africa, and the continent by providing entrepreneurs an opportunity to become part of the supply chain within the ShopRite Nigeria ecosystem. Her words: “ShopRite Nigeria has over 25 locations in Nigeria. The local vendor programme is an initiative of AWP Network, a social enterprise, which provides entrepreneurial training and an incubator experience for vendors seeking guidance on best practices and guidelines for certification. “The small and growing business sector and the COVID-19 crisis: Emerging Evidence on Key Risks and Needs,” a report put by Dalberg and the Aspen Network of Development Entrepreneurs,  stated that Small and Growing Businesses (SGBs) in countries, such as  Nigeria, are at “a significant risk of widespread failure’’. She added: “It is projected that nearly 42 percent of these (SGBs) are at the risk of failing in the next six months, a figure that is consistent across regions. In addition, many of these businesses have closed as a result of COVID-19. Therefore, interventions are needed urgently. Not just in terms of financing due to low cash balances and declining revenue but with growth programmes, such as The AWP Network Vendor Programme.” She continued: “We would like to train 50,000 women in five years. But we also understand that the quality of businesses matter.’’ She application said would close on August 31. She said the Cohort for the first batch would be announced on September 15. The programme would begin October 1, while the graduation/pitch would hold on November 4.
