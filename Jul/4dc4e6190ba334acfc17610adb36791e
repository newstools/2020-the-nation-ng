An analytical mind willing to learn new things and paying attention to details remains the hallmark of any successful engineer, the Rector of the Ogun State Institute of Technology, Igbesa, Engr. Mrs. Olufunke Akinkurolere, has said. She said such mind must display managerial, leadership, team-building and communication skills. She spoke during a virtual mentorship programme with female engineering students across campuses organised by the Abeokuta Chapter of the Association of Professional Women Engineers of Nigeria with the theme “Female Students in Engineering Discipline: Challenges and Prospects,”  where she admonished female engineering undergraduates never to give up on their dreams. While fielding questions from participants, the Rector highlighted career prospects that professionals could take advantage of in engineering practice to include: teaching/training and research, design and development, construction and production (manufacturing), engineering economics and management (maintenance) and consultancy, all of which are open to all engineers irrespective of gender.
