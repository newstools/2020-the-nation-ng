Emma Elekwa, Onitsha Anambra has commenced disbursement of ten percent tax deductions to traders and business owners in the state. Chairman, Anambra State Internal Revenue Service AiRS, Dr David Nzekwu, who announced this on Thursday at a stakeholders meeting on COVID-19 palliatives for traders and business owners, said the refund was from 2019 taxes. He said the package, which would be remitted online was in fulfillment of the promise by Governor Willie Obiano to cushion the effects of the pandemic. He said:”At the wake of the pandemic, the governor announced tax relief package for traders and business owners and extension of various assistance to the elderly and most vulnerable. “Most important of the packages is the 10percent tax relief to be given to every trader and business owners in the state. “We’ve been working on a system that will make it seamless for them to claim the stimulus package. “Today, we’ve called all the various associations in the state to put them through on the various steps to take how they could access those claims.” Commissioner, Trade and Commerce, Uche Okafor, appreciated the challenge in tax payment, especially with the current economic challenges but noted that the payment was much easier when the dividends were obvious. “We all remember how armed robbers waylay traders and collect their money. “But those are now history with the high level of security made possible by the Obiano-led administration. That’s one of the magics of tax payment. One of the beneficiaries, Hope Okoye, commended the government for the gesture but regretted the activities of numerous illegal revenue collectors, calling on government to check the ugly trend.
