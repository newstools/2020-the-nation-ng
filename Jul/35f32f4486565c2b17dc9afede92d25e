Nollywood actress and producer, Dayo Amusa, has stressed that it is better to be single than being in an abusive relationship. “It’s better to be alone than being in an abusive, toxic relationship”, Amusa announced. The actress said this while reacting to a report on East African singer, Shilole, who was domestically abused by her husband. Amusa said no woman deserves such inhuman treatment even with the level of respect the female gender has for the male. “No woman should go through this kind of humiliation, it’s not that we are weak and can’t fight back , it’s the respect and love that we have for you that brings submission, every woman in love will do everything to keep her marriage  going even when you date an imbecile,” the ‘Omoniyun’ said. She went on to say that most women want to be happily married, most especially celebrities. “No one wants to live alone, it’s very lonely up there, it’s even worse as a celebrity. This kind of action of uprooting women’s eyes and beating them like snakes is only done with men without morals and behaviours, the way I invest in my body, if one idiot lays his hands on me one day, I don’t know if I will call police or sergeant at arms, I think the president will address the nation that day, or his mother will find both of us in jail,” she said.
