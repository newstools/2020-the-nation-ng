 EDO State Media Campaign Council of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has said the triumphant entry into Edo by the former national chairman of APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, has left members of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) demoralised. The council, through its Chairman, Prince John Mayaki, noted that PDP members had refused to read the handwriting on the wall, resorting to empty gossips and character assassination. It said: “The triumphant entry of Comrade Oshiomhole to Edo State last week and the sea of people that dotted the streets and poured out to open spaces to welcome their leader home, have inflicted trauma on members of PDP and demoralised them, thereby shattering whatever hope they nurture of rigging their way to victory on September 19. “The people’s message was clear: ‘we stand wholeheartedly on this side of the divide, and with the might of our population, we will resist any kind of underhanded attempt to subvert our will’. “PDP members’ resort to belligerent attacks and mendacious propaganda betray a hollowness that has deepened itself over the years in a party lying about without vision. Obaseki was the man PDP sued, seeking to nail him for presenting fake and doctored certificates, as the output of an academic history mired in irrational inconsistencies. “Edo PDP, at present, is a chapter that its incompetence and irrelevance continue to stink, despite the national organ’s relentless attempt to rinse and bleach it with rainy dollars.
