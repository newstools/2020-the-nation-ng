 THE Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has called on the acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to step down. The call followed Monday’s quizzing of Ibrahim Magu over alleged infractions. In a statement last night by PDP spokesman Kola Ologbondiyan, the party urged President Muhammadu Buhari to show the genuineness of his war against corruption by allowing unhindered investigation of Magu. The party said Nigerians are already aware that Magu has been pulled in for questioning, adding that the fact that he has to be accompanied by an attorney showed that the said “invitation”, was beyond the routine. It further stated that the development around the EFCC chair as well as the “desperate attempt” by the Commission to cover or wave off his investigation, only raised more integrity questions regarding Magu’s activities in the EFCC. The statement said: “Only last month, the Attorney General of the Federation and Minster of Justice, Abubakar Malami, released a memo in which he indicted Magu of alleged diversion of recovered funds and fraudulent sale of assets seized by the EFCC.”
