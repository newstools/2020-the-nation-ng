A middle aged woman has reportedly attempted suicide over undisclosed marital challenges in Nnewi area of Anambra state. The victim whose name was given on her Facebook page as Ifeoma Obiora had in two separate posts claimed she was contemplating taking her life in order to be far from her troubles. She also said her problem was compounded as nobody was willing to hear her out or do anything about her plights. She said, “In these moments before my departure, I feel more clarity than I have ever felt in my dull life. In one minute, I will be free from the voices, from the pain, and from you.” “Nobody listened. Nobody cared.” Reacting, Police spokesperson, Haruna Mohammed said preliminary findings by the Police who had established contact with her showed she was in a troubled marriage and was seeking divorce. He said her challenges were civil but the Command had invited the couple for counselling. He said, “The Area Commander Nnewi has gotten her. She has a family problem and was seeking for divorce. “Although her problem is civil in nature but leaving her in that condition could lead to something else since she is threatening to take her life. “Hence the Area Commander has invited her and her husband tomorrow morning for further counselling.”
