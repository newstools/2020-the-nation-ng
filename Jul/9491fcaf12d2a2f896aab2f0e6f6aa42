 EDO State Deputy Governor Philip Shaibu has said the mission of Governor Godwin Obaseki for seeking re-election is to secure the state’s future against wastage. He said the people reposed confidence in Obaseki’s ability to ensure good governance by electing him in 2016, adding that the ongoing campaigns and the governor’s re-election bid were to consolidate on the successes recorded so far. Shaibu said: “We don’t need a government that will make provision for corruption in the annual budget. Edo State does not need arrogance of power that will be manifested in reckless and careless impunity. “We came to serve Edo State for the sake of noble service. Obaseki has come to serve the state and empty himself for selfless service, as a service provider in his private life. Therefore, whoever wishes Edo State well should support Obaseki, because he is not corrupt.” The deputy governor, who spoke through his Senior Special Assistant on Media, Benjamin Atu, said Obaseki had not failed the people. Said he: “We have served Edo State like church workers serving in the vineyard of God wholeheartedly. “The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is the foremost party in Nigeria. We will not fail Edo people and the PDP. The state needs a prudent personality like Obaseki, who has not looted and will not loot the resources of the state.”
