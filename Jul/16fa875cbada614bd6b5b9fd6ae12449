The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Kogi State chapter has rejected Saturday’s Court of Appeal judgement on the state governorship election, affirming Governor Yahaya Bello of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as being duly elected. The party in a statement issued by the state Publicity Secretary, Bode Ogunmola, in Lokoja on Sunday, described the Appeal Court judgement as a travesty of justice, and unacceptable to it, indicating it will approach the Supreme Court over the matter. “Governor Yahaya Bello and the APC can run, but cannot hide from the Supreme Court, where the blood of the innocent people killed in the Kogi election and the irregularities that characterized it would be pointed out,” stated the PDP. Ogunmola urged PDP supporters to “remain calm and be hopeful,” adding that the party will not give up until justice is delivered and Engr. Musa Wada becomes the governor of Kogi State, “haven overwhelmingly been voted for in the November 19 Governorship election.” Meanwhile, Dr. Tom Ohikere, a former Commissioner of Information in the state and APC chieftain, in a press release described the PDP as a corrupt party that is “bent on cutting corners to get mandates.” He said that the PDP failed in its case because the good people of the state who voted Bello into office know what they want, haven during his first term in office, tested and confirmed his credibility and capacity to lead the state to the next level of economic prosperity. According to him: “PDP is known for falsehood without prove, money bagged politics, and for all sorts of irregularities. “PDP’s Wada and his group should stop wasting borrowed money over a futile case, and join hands to build the state, if he ever meant well for Kogi, as he claimed. It is clear that GYB won the election unquestionably and the Appeal Court has also confirmed Bello as the valid winner of the election.”
