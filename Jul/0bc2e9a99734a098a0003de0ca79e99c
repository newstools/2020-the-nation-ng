 THE jostle for Ondo State governorship ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC) continued on Tuesday with two of the aspirants submitting their expression of interest and nomination forms at the party’s national secretariat in Abuja. They are former legal adviser of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Olusola Oke (SAN) and Chief Bukola Adetula. The aspirants were accompanied by their supporters. They expressed confidence in securing the party’s ticket and called for direct mode of primary on July 20. The aspirants said the incumbent governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, had nothing new to offer the state. Addressing reporters after submitting his forms, Oke said he was in the race to salvage the state and save APC from sliding into extinction. Adetula said Ondo State needed a real change, adding that Akeredolu had done his best, but his best was not good enough. He said priority would be given to industrialisation, promising to take Ondo out the current status of a civil service state to an industrialised state.
