Family of the late youth leader, Chike Okoye of Urueze Alor village, Ogidi, Idemili North Local Government Area of Anambra State has demanded for justice over their death of her son. Okoye reportedly died attempting to evade arrest by police who stormed his house in connection with alleged Ogbor land dispute, between the Uruezealor Village and the traditional ruler of Ogidi, Igwe Alex Onyido. Speaking on behalf of the family, elder brother to the deceased, Mr. Kinsley Okoye urged Governor Willie Obiano, Commissioner of Police, Mr. John Abang, Inspector General of Police, Mr. Mohammed Adamu, President Muhammadu Buhari and International community to intervene in the matter. He said the problem started when the monarch locked up the chairman of Uruezealor village, Mr. Obide Benedict at Ogidi Police station over the land issue following the monarch running battle with the villagers over the land. He said, “I’m passionately calling on the Commissioner of Police, Governor Willie Obiano, IGP, President Muhammadu Buhari and the whole world to come to our rescue. “These persons should ensure we get justice for the deliberate murder of my immediate junior brother who was not suffering from anything prior to his untimely death.” On her part, the deceased wife, Mrs. Ebele Okoye said she witnessed how the late husband was killed. “I want justice done in this case, let the perpetrators be brought to book, nobody is above the law. They have made me to become a widow at this early stage and the God I serve will not let them go scot-free,” she lamented.
