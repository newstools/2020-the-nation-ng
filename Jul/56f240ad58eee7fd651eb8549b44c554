 Manufacturers’ capacity utilisation declined marginally to 59.4 percent in the second half of 2019. This represents 1.6 percentage point decline from 61.0 per cent recorded in the second half of 2018. The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), however, said capacity utilisation increased by 5.3 percentage point when compared with 54.1 per cent recorded in the first half of 2019. MAN in its “Executive Summary,” which reviewed the economy in the second half of 2019, said capacity utilisation in the sector averaged 56.8 per cent in the year 2019, indicating 0.95 percentage point increase from 57.75 per cent average recorded in 2018. According to MAN, “The decline in capacity utilization in the sector over the review period was attributed to reduction in the purchasing power of the populace on account of the increasing inflation rate experienced in the country particularly in the second half of the year.” The Executive Summary, which was released over the weekend and made available to The Nation, said across sectoral groups, performance of capacity utilisation was a mixed bag. For instance, capacity utilisation declined in the Wood & Wood Products (62.2 per cent), Pulp, Paper, Printing & Publishing (62.4 per cent), Domestic/Industrial Plastic and Rubber group (52.0 per cent), Basic Metal, Iron & Steel (62.4 per cent) and Motor Vehicle & Miscellaneous Assembly group (52.8 per cent). However, it increased in Food, Beverage and Tobacco group (72.1 per cent), Textile Apparel & Footwear group (61.2 per cent), Chemical & Pharmaceutical (61.9 per cent), Non-metallic (60.3 per cent) and Electrical Electronics (47.1 per cent). Also, capacity utilisation in Food, Beverage and Tobacco increased to 72.1 per cent in the second half of 2019 as against 62.9 per cent recorded in the corresponding half of 2018; thus indicating 9.2 percentage point increase over the period. It also shows an increase of 18.8 percentage point when compared with 53.3 per cent recorded in the preceding half. Capacity utilisation in the group averaged 62.7 per cent in 2019 against 60.89 per cent average of 2018; thus indicating 1.81 percentage point increase over the period.
