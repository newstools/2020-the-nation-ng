Bugaje told journalists at the Polytechnic’s main campus that the institution has produced its own sanitizing machine and acquired advanced technology that can measure temperature. According to the Rector, “we have an Ultraviolet, UV based sanitizer. We are using that with 210 nanometers. This bandwidth of ultraviolet radiation is not hamful to the eyes or skin. So by the time you pass through this machine, any type of germs or virus in your body will be killed.” He added that the institution has a very robust clinic to accommodate sick patients and all the necessary Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) have been put in place.
