Nigerian football legend Victor Ikpeba has advised coach Gernot Rohr to invite Arsenal’s Bukayo Saka to the Super Eagles. The 18-year-old, who has been with the Gunners since he was seven years old, has been turning heads since making his first-team debut in 2018 under Unai Emery, impressing with his dribbling skills, trickery and eye for a killer pass. Saka continued with his awe-inspiring form in Tuesday’s 1-1 draw with Brendan Rodgers’ Leicester City – his 23rd appearance in the English top-flight this term. “Watching the Arsenal versus Leicester City game and I think Gernot Rohr should invite Bukayo Saka to the Super Eagles camp once the paperwork has been concluded,” Ikpeba tweeted.
