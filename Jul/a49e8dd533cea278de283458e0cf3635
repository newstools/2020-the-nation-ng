 An investment advisory and venture fund, Ingressive, has launched a non-profit subsidiary to empower African youths with micro-scholarships, technical training, and talent placement. The new unit, Ingressive For Good (I4G), is a not-for-profit organisation that addresses the  inequities that exist within African tech ecosystems by increasing the earning power of African youth through tech training and resources. The initiative, as part of the company’s responsibility to empower, inspire, and connect the next generation of tech talents in need of opportunities, will help the participants with micro-scholarships, technical training, talent placement, and also provide other resources to empower them. Participants can register on the company website to be part of the I4G network. “The three core goals of Ingressive For Good are to create 5,000 jobs through partnerships, connect 1,000,000 African youth to technical skills training and award scholarships to qualified individuals studying computer science courses, in line with our overarching mission to leverage need-based resources, learning, and the power of work to empower African youths in tech,” said Sean Burrowes, the Chief Operating Officer (COO) and co-founder of Ingressive for Good.
