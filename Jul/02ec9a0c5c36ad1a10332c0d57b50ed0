Mrs. Babalola, a Professor of Pharmacy, spoke as 148 newly admitted students of the university took the oath during the matriculation of the university held virtually Tuesday last week as a result of the COVID – 19 pandemic. The students admitted into the university’s three Colleges (Arts, Management and Social Sciences, Natural and Applied Sciences and Basic Medical Sciences) pledged to focus on their studies and be of good behaviour. A total of 350 people comprising the matriculating students, parents, guardians, the founder of the University, Mrs. Winifred Awosika, the Senate, and the University Council participated in the virtual matriculation ceremony through the Zoom platform. Addressing the students, Prof. Babalola, noted that without knowing it, COVID-19 had disrupted many areas of life, including compelling education, for example, to go the e-learning mode. She described the pandemic as gold field and urged the students to embrace new ideas, changes, novel learning and behaviour the COVID – 19 has foisted on humanity. She advised them to attend lectures regular, shun bad behaviour that could truncate their studies. Also speaking, Mrs. Awosika urged the Federal Government to re -open schools across the country, even if the reopening has to be staggered. She also called for greater national unity and cohesion, advising Nigerians to shun tribalism and other things that tended to polarise the nation.
