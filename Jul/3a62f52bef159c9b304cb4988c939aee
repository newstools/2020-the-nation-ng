As part of measures to curb the spread of COVID-19, the Ekiti State Government on Saturday announcedÂ the suspension of all pending local and traditional festivals in the state. In a statement in Ado-Ekiti by the State Coordinator of COVID-19 Task Force Response Team, Prof Bolaji Aluko, the government directed traditional rulers in towns and villages to indefinitely suspend all local festivals in their domain. Aluko explained that the traditional festivals were suspended for the rest of the year because of the increasing cases of COVID -19 in the state. He said the state had so far recorded 78 positive Coronavirus cases, with 29 active, 2 deaths, and 47 discharged, warning that the cases can rise dramatically if public assemblies continue unchecked.
