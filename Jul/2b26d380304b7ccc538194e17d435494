 A FEDERAL High Court, Uyo, has sentenced a Bible pirate, Mr. Chinonso Ugochukwu, to two years jail term. Ugochukwu was convicted for selling books subject to copyright, especially Bibles. Following investigation of a petition to the Nigerian Copyright Commission (NCC) by the Bible Society of Nigeria (BSN) dated June 18, 2014 alleging infringement of its works, the Uyo Office of the NCC had embarked on an anti-piracy operation on August 13, 2014 at Eket in which two shops belonging to the convict were raided and pirated Bibles and other copyright works were seized. Justice F. O. Riman convicted Mr. Ugochukwu of violation of sections 20(2) (a) and 20 (2)(c) of the Copyright Act, 2004 and sentenced him to one year imprisonment on each of the two counts with the option of fine.
