 THE youth leadership of Urhobo Progress Union (UPU) has called on the Delta State Police Command to investigate alleged attempts by a police officer to shield a 40-year-old man from facing prosecution for the rape of a seven-year-old girl. The youth body alleged collusion between the police in Ughelli Police Division and the alleged rapist. Delta Commissioner of Police, Hafiz Inuwa debunked the allegation, stressing that he ordered for a transfer of the case to Asaba because the Ughelli Police Division does not have the power to charge the matter to court. He said, “I ordered for that case to be transferred to the command headquarters, but it is not based on the fact that they wanted to cover up the crime. The division has no right to charge such a matter to court, such cases are like armed robbery, defilement, rape. They are supposed to be handled at the SCID because we have a dedicated section to deal with such cases.”
