The Federal Government has received critical medical equipment for effective response to COVID-19 pandemic from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and West African Health Organisation (WAHO). Among the medical supplies were ventilators, test kits, personal protective equipment (PPEs) and face masks. The Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, while receiving the donation on behalf of the Federal Government in Abuja, said, “I am informed that this donation includes ventilators, test kits, personal protective equipment (PPE’s) and face masks, which is always good news, as these products are critical supplies in our COVID-19 response strategy. “We also appreciate the choice of Abuja by ECOWAS and WAHO, as the central hub for receipt and distribution of regional supplies of medical products and equipment for the fight against COVID-19. “It is a great indication of confidence and we shall play our role in providing support to our fellow member states in the ECOWAS sub-region, to fight this disease outbreak, of which President Buhari was recently designated Champion of the COVID-19 response. “The public health institution of the Federal Ministry of Health, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), has been focused on providing the public health guidance we need to tackle the challenge. “Our health workers are toiling assiduously to treat COVID-19 patients, provide emergency care, while not losing sight of routine and essential health services. “As Chair of the ECOWAS COVID-19 Ministerial Coordinating Committee on Health, I am certain that when other ECOWAS Member States receive their portion of these supplies, they will be just as appreciative of the generosity of the Government and people of Germany.” -End-
