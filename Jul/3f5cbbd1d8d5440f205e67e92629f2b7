 ALL centres where applicants for the Federal Government’s 774,000 job scheme in Niger State have been suspended. The Nation gathered that the suspension was sequel to complaints and reports that officials at the centre were extorting the applicants, charging them N500 and above per application. The application for the Special Public Works is free. A statement by the Chairperson, Media Contact and Mobilisation Subcommittee, Aisha Machedy said, “The data collection centres were supposed to be free centres for the collection and submission of the completed forms. There was no agreement whatsoever between the committee and the data centres for money collected to be shared. The information, therefore, is fake in its entirety.”
