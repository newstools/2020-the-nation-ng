 BARGAIN-HUNTING for value stocks drove activities at the stock market as investors sought to take positions ahead of the expected inflow of first-half results of quoted companies. Nigerian equities held steady pricing throughout the week and closed weekend with marginal average decline of 0.08 per cent, equivalent to net capital depreciation of N10 billion. Transactions in three low-priced banking stocks- Sterling Bank, FCMB Holdings and FBN Holdings accounted for more than one-thirds of total transaction volume at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) last week. Total turnover at the NSE increased by 12.8 per cent to 1.02 billion shares worth N7.44 billion in 18,092 deals last week compared with a total of 901.54 million shares valued at N13.45 billion traded in 18,676 deals two weeks ago. The trio of Sterling Bank, FCMB Holdings and FBN Holdings were the most active stocks, accounting for 416.99 million shares worth N791.08 million in 2,752 deals, representing 41.06 per cent of the total equity turnover volume. “In the coming week, we expect market performance to improve on bargain hunting activities,” Afrinvest Securities stated. Companies quoted on the NSE are expected to submit their interim report and accounts for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020 within the next few weeks, in line with extant regulations and regulatory consideration granted to quoted companies in the wake of Coronavirus pandemic. The benchmark index for Nigerian equities, the All Share Index (ASI) closed weekend at 24,287.66 points, 0.08 per cent below the week’s opening index of 24,306.36 points. Aggregate market value of all quoted equities at the NSE dropped marginally from the week’s opening value of N12.680 trillion to close weekend at N12.670 trillion. Average year-to-date return now stands at -9.52 per cent. Senior Research Analyst, FXTM, Lukman Otunuga, said Nigerian equities were steady despite Coronavirus cases topping 34,000 in Africa’s largest economy. He noted that while economic fundamentals might not be impressive, Nigerian equities may find support from vaccine hopes and expectations of further stimulus for pandemic-hit economies. Analysts at Cordros Securities, however, remained cautious about the market outlook noting that increasing number of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria and weak economic conditions remain considerable risk factors.
