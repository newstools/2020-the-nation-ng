 A POLICE INTELLIGENCE team has freed an American woman from captivity in a Lagos hotel where her Nigerian Facebook lover reportedly held her since May last year. The American’s 34-year-old lover, Chukwuebuka Kasi Obiaku, has also been arrested. The woman, a retired civil servant from Washington DC, USA, was said to have visited Nigeria on May 13, last year to meet Obiaku, a native of Imo State, who married her on May 15, 2019. Police said Obiaku soon defrauded her of over $48,000, even taking charge of her bank cards. Force spokesman DCP Frank Mba said Obiaku, a graduate of Business Administration and Management, is suspected to have defrauded many victims locally and internationally. “The rescue of the American lady is coming on the heels of a similar case of abducted Filipino lady who was lured to Nigeria by her supposed lover whom she equally met on Facebook,” Mba said in a statement yesterday.
