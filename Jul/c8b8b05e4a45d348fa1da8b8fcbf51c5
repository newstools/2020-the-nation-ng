 THE Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment has advised manufacturers to embrace calibration to boost trading activities in the country. The Assistant Director in charge of Weight and Measures Department in the ministry, Mr Femi Abdulkarim, stated this at an enforcement drive in Lagos. He said the exercise followed the complaints the ministry received on alleged high-level trade malpractices from consumers. Calibration is a means by which an instrument’s or equipment’s accuracy is compared to a known and proven standard. The enforcement, which was carried out to cross-check all the weight and measures equipment used by some factories in Lagos, uncovered a company producing kegs without labelling the units of the kegs. Abdulkarim described such practices as contrary to the Weight and Measures Act. He said consumers had complained about being short-changed after spending their hard-earned money to buy goods from which they were not getting equal value for their money. According to him, the calibration is crucial, especially now that consumers’ purchasing power has dropped. The assistant director said the ministry would ensure that consumers get value for their money. “In the process of carrying out our official duty, we tested this particular equipment and we discovered that they are moulding kegs and on the kegs, they put ‘5’ on each keg and we do not know if it is five litres or five kilogrammes,” Abdulkarim said.
