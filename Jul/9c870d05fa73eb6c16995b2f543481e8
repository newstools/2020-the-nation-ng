A patrol team of vigilance and police officials in Kogi State on Sunday foiled a kidnap attempt along Lokoja-Okene highway. Four of the suspected kidnappers were killed, police said. An eyewitness said four of the suspects were shot and killed when they tried to abduct travellers about 6.30pm. Activities of daredevil kidnappers along the corridor prompted the state security adviser, Comdr Jerry Omodara (rtd.) to deploy men of the state vigilante services to the road to complement efforts of the state police command. The effort, it appears, paid off on Sunday when four of the suspected kidnappers were reportedly killed along the route. Police spokesman William Aya, a Deputy Superintendent, said he would contact police authorities in the area before commenting on the incident.
