 BARRING any last minute volte-face, Nigeria international striker Victor Osimhen may undergo medicals at Italian Serie A club Napoli on Thursday as one of his conditions to seal his transfer from French Ligue 1 side, Lille. There have been so much hullaballoos in the last few weeks over the destination of the 21-year-old  striker but quoting  credible sources privy to the on-going negotiations,  Italian prestige website Italia Football , claimed the deal is almost done  and dusted  with words rife that the player might undergo medical tests  tomorrow. “Victor Osimhen will sign for Napoli over the next 48 hours as the problem was always with his agent, who is now threatening to sue the Lille striker,” sources told  Football Italia. Meanwhile, multiple sources including L’Equipe claimed that final negotiations are taking place today (Tuesday)  and tomorrow (Wednesday) in Sardinia to secure the deal, worth in the region of 81m Euros. The Corriere dello Sport maintain it’ll be 50m Euros cash plus full-back Adam Ounas to cover the difference. Sources  close to Osimhen  reportedly confirm the issue that had prompted him to turn down Napoli last week was with his entourage and that was smoothed over by the arrival of a new intermediary. Now those same sources confirm – as is also reported by RAI Sport and CalcioNapoli24 – that the previous agent was trying to negotiate extra bonuses for himself rather than focusing on the best deal for the player.
