 MEDICAL doctors at the Ondo Infectious Disease Hospital (IDH), on the platform of the National Association of Government General Medical and Dental Practitioners (NAGGMDP), have stopped attending to patients admitted at the hospital. The Ondo IDH is where patients that tested positive to infectious disease like Lassa fever and Coronavirus are treated. Secretary of NAGGMDP Dr. Olasakinju Tunde, who announced the doctors’ withdrawal of service in a statement, said it was due to failure of state government to accede to their demands. Their demands include alleged government’s failure to conclude negotiations on the erstwhile suspended Minimum Wage and Consequential Adjustments already enjoyed by the Non-Medical Staff since January, inadequate supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) and the need to improve the welfare of members as well as approval of life insurance for frontline doctors. The state government, however, said it has run out of bed spaces at the IDH Infectious in Akure. Besides bed spaces, it said medical equipment and personnel put in place to combat coronavirus pandemic have been stressed beyond limit. It noted that the obvious implication of its current situation was that “prevention is the best way to reduce pressure on cure”. Akeredolu, who stated this in a broadcast on Monday, said 20 persons have died due to COVID-19 complications and over 472 persons have tested positive to the infection. The governor urged political parties, participating in the oncoming elections, to adhere strictly to INEC guidelines to assure safety and good health for our people.
