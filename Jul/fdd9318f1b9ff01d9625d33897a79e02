MANCHESTER United left-back Luke Shaw will miss the FA Cup semi-final against Chelsea after failing to recover from an ankle problem. Shaw’s fellow defender Brandon Williams should be fit after a facial injury. “Luke will be out. Brandon will try to join in training on Saturday with his eye. We’ll see if he can see the ball,” said manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Midfielder N’Golo Kante will miss a fourth successive game for Chelsea because of a hamstring injury.  Scottish midfielder Billy Gilmour, 19, is out for the remainder of the season following knee surgery. Sergio Romero has been in goal for United’s cup games, but Solskjaer refused to confirm whether he, or striker Jesse Lingard, would be involved at Wembley. “The team is not selected yet. Jesse and Sergio both have a good chance of being involved,” said Solskjaer.
