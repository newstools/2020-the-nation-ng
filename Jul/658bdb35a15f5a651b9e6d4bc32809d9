 THE House of Representatives ad-hoc committee investigating the non- implementation of the pay as you go tariff plan by satellite broadcasters and DSTV subscription price increase has asked the Director General of the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control NCDC, Dr. Ihekweazu Chikwe, to locate the Chief Executive Officer of Multichoice (operators of DSTV), John Ugbe and test him for COVID-19 virus. The committee headed by Rep. Unyime Idem while passing the resolution also asked the agency to immediately commence contact tracing of passengers in the plane with him, his staff and people he may have had contact with at the airport. The Committee thereafter gave the NCDC four days to get back to it after instructing the clerk of the Committee to immediately communicate the resolution of the lawmakers to the NCDC. Meanwhile, the House of Representatives have asked the World Health Organisation (WHO) to adhere strictly to the ethics of medical research for planned clinical trials of the COVID-19 vaccines. Speaking when the new Country Representative of the World Health Organisation in Nigeria visited the House, Chairman of the House Committee on Healthcare Services, Rep. Tanko Sununu said nobody should be used as a scape goat to achieve an aim, saying it was the only way the organisation can prove that it has been fair to all in the fight against Covid-19.
