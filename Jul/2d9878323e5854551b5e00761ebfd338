General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) Pastor Enoch Adeboye has told those criticising him recently that his comments and sermons were not meant for them. He was responding to criticism of his birthday message to his wife, Folu, last week. Adeboye had praised his wife, saying she is a submissive woman who still cooked and looked after his welfare. But the comment attracted wild criticism on social media with some describing him as a male chauvinist. Speaking on Sunday in a sermon titled “From lockdown to lifting up”, the respected 78-year-old cleric said only his children would understand his comments and perspectives. He argued some of the things he says annoy non-members of the church. In the sermon broadcast live via the church’s TV, Dove Media, Adeboye said: “As a matter of fact, if there is a way of preaching this sermon just to my own children alone, that is what I would have done. “Not because I’m selfish but occasionally there are things you say to your children that would annoy outsiders. “And you keep on saying, but I am not talking to you, I am talking to my children. But now, the lockdown has made the door open to everybody. “Some people see the glory but don’t know the story. Some people see me and say all kinds of things. It’s none of my business. “I don’t need to answer you; I just need to keep on riding high with my king. I’m talking to my children, so others should not be angry with me. Before you take off, consider your landing.”
