 LEICESTER City striker Jamie Vardy became the oldest player to win the Premier League Golden Boot after finishing the season with 23 goals. The 33-year-old ended up a goal clear of Arsenal’s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Southampton striker Danny Ings, both on 22. Vardy is the ninth English player to win or share the Golden Boot. Last season Liverpool duo Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah and Arsenal’s Aubameyang shared it with 22 each. Vardy still finished clear despite failing to score on the final day as Leicester lost 2-0 to Manchester United to miss out on a Champions League place.
