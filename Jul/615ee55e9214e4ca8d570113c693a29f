Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, on Tuesday, said that the National Assembly would engage with security agencies to up their game in order to stop killings in Southern Kaduna. Lawan gave the pledge in his remarks on a point of order raised by Senator Danjuma La’ah (Kaduna South) at plenary. Senator La’ah has via a point of order lamented the incessant killing of his people in Kaduna South by suspected armed bandits. La’ah said: “I wish to bring a request before this Senate, that there is incessant killings in Kaduna South, which I’m seeking the help of the Senate to send military men and police to help us overcome the situation in southern Kaduna. “It has become a very serious matter that many people are being killed. The situation is very embarrassing and I’m pleading with the National Assembly to request the Federal Government to send the Police and armed men to protect the lives of my people and their property. “It is unbecoming, as this situation has been on for many years and it has got to this point even though I’ve been complaining. “The situation as at the other time was calmed down, but it has started again, and I pray the National Assembly will help to provide military men to help the situation.” Lawan, in his response, expressed the willingness of the National Assembly to engage security agencies with a view to upscaling operations around areas prone to attacks in Kaduna South. “I will suggest that we talk to the security agencies to upscale their activities around those hot spots in Kaduna, and this is something that we owe the Nigerian people,” Lawan said. Meanwhile, the Senate President on Tuesday referred President Muhammadu Buhari’s request for the confirmation of Mr. John Usanga (Akwa Ibom) and Air Commodore Peter Ndabake Gana (Rtd.)
