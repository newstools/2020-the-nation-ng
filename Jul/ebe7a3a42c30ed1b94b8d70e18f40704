Ebonyi Governor David Umahi on Monday indefinitely suspended the State Auditor General, Innocent Nweda with immediate effect. He also suspended the Auditor General for local government in the state, George Ukpai. Secretary to the State Government(SSG) Kenneth Ugbala announced this in a statement in Abakaliki, the state capital. The statement said their suspension was as a result of their failure to perform duties of their offices.

Umahi further directed that Nweda should hand over to the next most senior officer in rank. He also directed one Dr U. A. Udu should take over as Acting Auditor General for local government until further notice. “All handover and takeover should be concluded before the close of work on Monday 13 July 2020,” the statement added.
