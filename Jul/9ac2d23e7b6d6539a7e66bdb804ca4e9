Two of Bournemouth, Watford and Villa will join already relegated Norwich in the Championship next season. Villa have the upper hand with a three-point lead on Bournemouth and a marginally better goal difference than Watford. Dean Smith’s men also have momentum after a 1-0 win over Arsenal on Tuesday and travel to a West Ham side now sure of their place in the Premier League next season. “Results went our way in the week and we’re above the dotted line at the moment,” said Smith. “The most important thing is to be above that dotted line on Sunday and we know we have to win to guarantee that.” Watford’s sacking of Nigel Pearson with just two games of the season remaining did the Hornets little good in a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of Manchester City on Wednesday and they travel to Arsenal needing to better Villa’s result. Should both lose then Bournemouth could extend their five-season stay in the top-flight by beating Everton at Goodison Park. “The next game is the biggest game of all our careers,” said Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe.
