 THE Chairman, All Progressives Congress (APC) Governors’ Forum, Kebbi State Governor Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, has said APC governors will mobilise for the victory of the party’s governorship candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, in the coming election. He was responding to questions on APC’s chances in the coming polls in Edo and Ondo states. Bagudu hoped that the party would emerge victorious in the elections following the achievements of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration. He debunked insinuation that six APC governors were planning to leave the party, saying all elected public officials under the party believed in its ideology.
