It’s exactly five weeks after Ngozi Okonkwo’s painful exit from mother earth and on Thursday, June 4, the highly cerebral chief legal officer of Oando Plc, will finally be laid to rest. Okonkwo’s remains will, on Saturday, July 11, be interred at a private cemetery located in the highbrow area of Ikoyi, Lagos. Society Rendezvous gathered that the entire funeral programme will be a strictly private affair with only immediate family members and very few close friends and associates in attendance in compliance with the current guidelines occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic. Before she finally gave up to cancer at age 45, Ngozi was said to have recovered and resumed at her duty post until she suffered a relapse during the COVID-19 lockdown and could not travel out of the country to see her doctors. According to a source, “The best available health facilities in Nigeria couldn’t help her; in the process, she lost the battle.” Oil tycoon and Group Chief Executive Officer, Oando Plc, Adewale Tinubu, described the deceased as a wonderful soul who was ready for every goal-oriented endeavour. “Oando has lost a true leader– kind, passionate, driven, focused, and diligent goal-getter. She was an exemplary professional astute lawyer, who commanded respect from all sundry. She was knowledgeable, efficient, competent, and diligent. She was what we all hope for in a team member. She was an embodiment of empathy, loyalty, support, and trust. She was someone you wanted by your side when winning was the goal. She was a focus, audacious.” Before joining Oando PLC, Ngozi had worked as Junior Counsel with F.O. Akinrele & Co and also with KPMG Professional Services (previously known as Arthur Andersen) as Manager in the Tax, Regulatory and People Services Unit and Head of Indirect Tax Services.
