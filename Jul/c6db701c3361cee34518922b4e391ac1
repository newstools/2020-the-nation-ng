Borno Governor Babagana Zulum has attributed Wednesday’s attack on his convoy between Monguno and Baga town to military sabotage. The Nation had reported the Governor’s convoy was attacked by gunmen suspected to be Boko Haram terrorists during a tour of displaced communities along Monguno and Baga axis in the Lake Chad region. Zulum, in a viral video with the Commander in the area, pointed accusing finger at the Army, alleging attempt to sabotage the visit with the attack. The Governor was convinced the exchange of fires was between the Nigeria Army and the Police Special Anti- Robbery Squad (FSARS) leading his convoy into Baga town. Eyewitnesses said the Governor was whisked away from his official car and smuggled into the FSARS armoured personnel carrier vehicles during the attack. Reliving the incident to reporters in Monguno on Thursday, Zulum said: “As far as I am concerned what happened in Baga was a complete sabotage by the military. There is no Boko Haram in Baga. “I wonder because we have over 1,181 soldiers in Baga, 72 officers, 107 solders, 400 soldiers in Mile 4 and 1,900 soldiers in Monguno. I see no reason why only five Boko Haram will stop them from occupying Bags town. “The troops have been in Mile 4 for over one year, there is complete sabotage, the problem is not with President Buhari or General Buhari but the command and control structure. There is a need to look into command structure.” On why the visit became necessary, he said: “We have over 80,000 IDPs in Monguno, they cannot continue to depend on NGO and others for food. We have created opportunities for them to go back to their communities and continue with their business and farming activities. “After Sallah we are going to allow people to go back to Kukawa and we will give time to the military. “If they will not clear Baga, we will mobilise our hunters, CJTF and vigilantes to recapture Baga. We cannot continue like this. People have taken their destiny in their hands.”
