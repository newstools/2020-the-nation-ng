 TRADERS at the Alade Market, Allen Avenue, Ikeja, Lagos have appealed to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to intervene in the construction of the N13billion Alade Market Mall being undertaken by a developer, Masters Realities International Concepts Limited. Speaking through their lawyer, Ms Yetunde Fasheun-Souza yesterday at a media briefing, they urged the governor to order the developer back to site to start rebuilding the facility as agreed with the owners of the land, Ikeja Local Government in 2016. They lamented that four years after Ikeja Local Government signed a-30-year concession agreement with the developers in 2016, the company has failed to rebuild the market. “My clients want to move back to the old site of  Alade market. They are not selling here, business is dull but regrettably, there is nothing on the ground to show the readiness of the developer to commence reconstruction on the land,” Fasheun-Souza said. The Group Managing Director of Masters Realities International Concepts, Lai Omotola said his company was not at fault. Omotola said the local government authority did not make money available for periodic maintenance of the temporary site of Alade market, adding, “Out of N71 million owed us between 2017 to date, our company has only received N9 million”. He said his company has moved to site and that “once we complete the  market, they will move back to the new market if they are able to pay for the new shops.”
