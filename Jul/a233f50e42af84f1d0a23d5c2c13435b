In 2016, providence granted respected lawyer and politician, Arakurin Rotimi Akeredolu, SAN, his heart desires as he won a keenly contested election against odds. In the build-up to the election, Akeredolu at no point saw any reason to entomb his living dream. Indeed, some of his detractors reportedly tagged him as an incorrigible dreamer, but the lawyer was unperturbed about the enormity of the odds against him. Everywhere he went during the campaign, he was armed with his pragmatic manifesto, pleading with his people to give him a chance to serve them. Even when it was obvious that some powerful elements in the state posed a threat to his political ambition, he held on to his dream with uncommon steadfastness. Luckily, he eventually had the last laugh. It will be recalled that he had lost the bid to clinch the number one job in the state in 2012. But the experience only toughened him when he offered himself to serve his people again. While he was neck-deep in the campaign, he still maintained his cool, even in the face of needless lies and abuses hurled at him, he refused to join issues with his other political opponents. Today, Akeredolu is already showing evidence of a brilliant mind who knows what to do when fate offers him a rare opportunity in life. With three years and a half into his first term, Aketi, as he is popularly called by his admirers, has proved that he is indeed a silent achiever. Sources from the state say the incumbent governor of Ondo State has left his indelible footprints in several sectors of the state. Society Rendezvous gathered that despite recently contracting the deadly COVID-19 virus and currently under self-isolation, he is ready to take his opponents to the cleaners at the polls.
