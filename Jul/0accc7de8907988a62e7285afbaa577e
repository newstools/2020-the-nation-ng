A bus driver in the south-west of France has been left brain dead after reportedly being attacked by passengers who refused to wear face masks. The driver in Bayonne had refused to allow several people – who had no tickets and were not wearing masks – to board the bus on Sunday night, a police source told AFP news agency. The man, who is in his 50s, sustained serious head injuries after being punched. He was declared brain dead on Monday. Face masks are mandatory on public transport in France. According to France Bleu, a number of people have been arrested. Union sources told the local radio station that the driver had attempted to prevent the group from bringing a dog on board. Regional bus services have been disrupted as drivers refuse to work following the incident. (www.newsnow.co.uk)
