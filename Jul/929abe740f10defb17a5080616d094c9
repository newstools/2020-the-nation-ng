Tunde Liadi Ndubuisi Egbo has called on the Football Associations across Africa to have more confidence in local coaches. Egbo, a former Super Eagles goalkeeper, made history last week when he became the first Nigerian manager to win a league title in Europe. The 46-year-old manager led Albania side KF Tirana to their 25th and first championship crown in more than a decade and would be the first Nigerian manager in the UEFA Champions League when he leads Tirana to Europe’s premier club competition next season. “Actually, in Africa we tend to give foreigners more preference, respect and opportunities than our own,” Egbo said. “When we are not given the respect and opportunity to grow on our own it doesn’t augur well. “Some other continents respect their coaches. Why are we not doing the same? Sunday Oliseh, Emmanuel Amuneke and Samson Siasia were there. We just need to support our coaches,” he added. Egbo also highlighted the need for football associations to allow coaches work freely with little or no interference, explaining that those that hire must accept and support 100% for such coach to do his job since he has his own mentality and coaching philosophy. He said: “If we can give them the opportunity to work without interference it will be fine. We don’t allow domestic coaches to do as much as they will like to do freely. “Oliseh was there and I think he tried his best but maybe some people do not like his manner of approach because of his strong mentality. “You must have a strong mentality as a coach and you must have your coaching philosophy. When you employ a coach, you just have to accept everything about him and allow him to do his job,” he noted.
