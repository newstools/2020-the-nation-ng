 EDO State Deputy Governor Phillip Shaibu has berated a former deputy speaker of the House of Assembly, Festus Ebea, over his “sickening and unacceptable” comments on the 2024 governorship election in Edo. Shaibu, in a statement yesterday in Benin by his Senior Special Assistant on Media, Benjamin Atu, said his destiny was in God’s hands, adding that it was He (GOD) who could determine his future. Ebea had said Shaibu was backing the re-election of Governor Godwin Obaseki on the platform of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), so that he would hand over to him (Shaibu) in 2024. Edo deputy governor said: “I don’t know the next position God is taking me to. I am not like Ebea who brags about his ability. I brag about God’s ability, which is my driving force. Ebea should speak about himself. He should not speak for me. Ebea should face his principal, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu (the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress). “Ebea is not my friend and we don’t belong to the same school of thought. I belong to the school of thought representing the people when voted for. I did not abscond from my duty post like he did when he was voted for in his constituency. He should check my records and his records.
