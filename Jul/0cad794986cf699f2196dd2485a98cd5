Minister of State for Environment Sharon Ikeazor has said society cannot properly develop without appropriate legal framework. Ikeazor spoke in Abuja while receiving the new leadership of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) Abuja branch on a courtesy visit. Thanking the visitors for the call, she said her success so far is the result of her application of legal frameworks. According to her, Nigeria is not short of regulation but implementation is the problem. She charged the NBA to support and be the conscience of public servants “to make sure that the right thing is done.” The minister pledged to look into the expertise of the NBA in developing the legal framework on climate change in Nigeria and also in reviewing laws as they relate to the ministry instead of getting independent lawyers as consultants. Earlier, NBA Abuja branch chairman Hauwa Shekerau expressed hope that the visit would familiarise the branch with the ministry and create areas of collaboration. Shekerau noted that this is in furtherance of the exco’s determination to make impact in the two years of its tenure. According to her, law is an instrument for sustainable development and lawyers have what it takes to put together the necessary legal framework and policy. She noted that the minister being a lawyer, would easily appreciate what the branch “can bring to the table.” The Chairman also urged the Minister to register and pay bar dues to the branch so that she will be a full-fledged member. She  solicited the minister’s support in building the Abuja Bar Centre, adding that the branch had already bought land and secured funds to start the project. “Lawyers in all arms of government too can support the building project,” Shekerau said. The minister, she added, would be invited to host the branch’s monthly meeting “in the nearest future when it is safe and the protocol for practicing safe distance can be maintained.”
