 Wednesday night saw former housemates of the Big Brother Naija Pepper Dem edition thrash out an issue that happened in the hotel between Mercy Akide (Tacha) and Chinonso Opara (Kim Oprah). Kim Oprah accused Tacha of “trying to intimidate and bully” her as there was an incident where Tacha came at her in the hotel, recording and saying that her confidence got her a car, and Kim should produce her own. In her words “I don’t understand why you would come at me, bully me intimidating me and recording me at the same time after the show” Tacha denied it saying “I don’t know what you are talking about. I cannot remember anything that happed that day”, but housemates, Esther, Omashola and the winner of the show, Mercy, spoke on the incident, all giving similar accounts of Tacha recording and intimidating Kim Oprah. Mercy apologized to Kim Oprah for denying that she has not seen the incident, but she said “I am not going to bring it out, but I have the video” Omashola explained that Tacha should understand that this is a re-union show where all issues should be resolved and they grow Frodd and Esther had their time to talk on their relationships, where Esther was disappointed with the perception Frodd created about her as someone that did not like him and was always angry and did not let the relationship work. Frodd spoke, saying he wants her to flaunt him, even if on national television, as proof that she loves him. Venita, speaking on their relationship said “it is repairable. You just need to be on the same level and have the same energy towards each other.” Ebuka-Obi Uchendu advised them to sit down and talk, and there will be a solution to their flawed relationship.
