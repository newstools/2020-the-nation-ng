The National Economic Council (NEC) on Thursday promised to hold further discussions with the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 on the reopening of the economy and schools. Delta State Governor Ifeanyi Okowa spoke through Kaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai in a virtual address with State House correspondents after a virtual NEC meeting presided over by Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo at the Presidential Villa in Abuja. Okowa said the council took the report on the interface between NEC’s ad hoc committee and the PTF on COVID-19 on the ease of the lockdown and reopening of the economy. “A lot has been done because we have had several meetings with the PTF and our inputs have been taken in the briefings to the President and the guidelines have been released. “Since we started the meeting on May 28, lots of decisions have been taken and these decisions have already started to impact on the economy. “Currently, the formal and informal sectors of the economy have gradually been reopened, apart from a few segments that still need to be discussed. We have also realised that the rural areas have also been opened to farming activities. According to him, there are still other sectors of the economy that may not be open until further discussions are held. Okowa said the interface also discussed the issue concerning the reopening of worship centres and in many states of the federation, including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). “Worship centres have been reopened with good protocols to be put in place, which ought to be monitored by the various states and the FCT. So, a lot is actually being done.” Also, president of the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA), Prof. Innocent Ujah, on Thursday hailed the Federal Government for maintaining the shutdown of schools. Speaking with The Nation in Abuja, Ujah said: “We are 100 per cent in agreement with the Federal Government’s decision to continue the shutdown of schools.
