NATIONAL Association of Nigerian Theatre Arts Practitioners (NANTAP) has released a set of guidelines for artistes and production companies as they return to work as the ease of lock-down across the nation continues. The aim of the guidelines is to ensure that a safety net that allow artistes and production companies to return to work is created, both for the artistes, employers, prospective patrons and the audience. Some aspects of the performer`s guidelines include the need to enlist for personal Performers’ Health Insurance, insisting on a contract and work environment that considers his/her safety and health, and of course, observance of all health protocols as laid down by the Federal Government. On the other hand, the guidelines request production companies and employers to observe strict adherence to all government guidelines/protocols on crowd gathering and social distancing, provide a health worker for everyshow, carry out testing of all casts and crew before and during engagements; and must ensure that all audience members, casts and crew are on face masks, even as they observe physical distancing in seating arrangements. NANTAP shall ensure that her members are educated on the need to comply with these guidelines, while providing free Certification training on safety  protocols for members and member organisations upon request.
