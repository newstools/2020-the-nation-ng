 The Registrar-General, Corporate Affairs Commission (CA) Garba Abubakar  at the weekend said the commission has started the use of courier services for the delivery of certificates to customers. He spoke at a briefing in Abuja, insisting that the mailing system would replace physical presence with customers. According to him, the whole world is still threading with care for fear of the covid-19 pandemic as things have not returned to normal, even with that, the commission has been rendering services, though at the risk of the lives of staff. “Again, the life of staff is at risk because they interact with customers, this cannot continue. The government guidelines have urged all to comply with the rules by adhering to restrictions. Presently CAC system is not fully electronic so there is need to decongest by using the mailing courier. “We have introduced a mailing system where customers submit their documents through courier services and receive it through the same services. This system was introduced a week ago and so far, 400 customers have collected their certificates. For applications done online, they will be replied online, if it is physical, parcel your documents give to the courier services, it will be worked on and mailed back to you,” he said. The registrar-general  also said from May 29, this year,  certificates issued by CAC has  Tax Identification Number (TIN) number on them, adding that from August 10, this year, there would be no need for customers to submit original documents. “The era of carrying documents to CAC is over. They cannot be allowed in except by appointment,” he said.
