Roger Federer has said he is “missing” Wimbledon after the grass-court Grand Slam was cancelled, but hopes to play the tournament in 2021. The 38-year-old, who has undergone two knee surgeries this year, had already announced he will not play again until next year. This week was scheduled to be the second week of Wimbledon, where Federer has won a record eight men’s singles titles, but the tournament was cancelled for the first time since World War II due to the coronavirus pandemic.
