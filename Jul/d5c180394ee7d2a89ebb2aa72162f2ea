A middle-aged woman slumped and died on Monday in Ughelli, Ughelli North Local Council, Delta State, upon hearing the news that her husband tested positive to COVID-19, The Nation has learnt. The tragedy, which happened at Igho Salami Street, Uloho Avenue, threw neighbours into mourning. Sympathisers were seen in small groups discussing the matter, but unwilling to talk about the incident to strangers. A source, who craved anonymity, said the woman was at home when the news of her husband sample result came out, testing positive to Covid-19. “I am sure she has been managing high blood pressure before now, because as soon as she was told her husband tested positive, she slump and died before they could rush her to the hospital,” the source said.
