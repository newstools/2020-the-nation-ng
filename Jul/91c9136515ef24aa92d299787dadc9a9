The Federal High Court in Lagos on Thursday further adjourned till August 12 for a report of settlement in a $14million debt case between Ecobank Nigeria Limited and Sahara Group Limited. Justice Rilwan Aikawa adjourned at the instance of counsel for Sahara Group Limited and Ecobank Nigeria Limited, Messrs Bode Olanipekun (SAN) and Mr Kunle Ogunba (SAN). The lawyers had on July 3 told the judge of parties’ intention to settle. The judge had adjourned till July 10 and subsequently to yesterday at the parties’ request. Ecobank is praying the court to enter summary judgment in its favour against Sahara Group and its sister company. Ogunba sought the hearing of his pending motion for judgment for $9,125,119.34, which he said the firms admitted owing. Ecobank claimed that based on computation, the firms owed it $14,069458.30 “being the principal sum and interest due to the counter-claimant as of 21st August 2019.” It said though the companies offered to pay it $9,125,119.34 “as a full and final settlement of their indebtedness,” it remained firm in its demand for $14,069,458.30 as their debt as of August 21, 2019. The bank urged the court to, in the meantime, order the firms to pay the $9,125,119.34, which they admitted owing “after the joint reconciliation carried out by parties.” It further prayed the court to compel the oil firms to pay it another $5,069,458.30 “being the outstanding correspondence to the defendant in tandem with the offer letters of the 1st of May, 2016 and other subsisting agreements between the parties.”
