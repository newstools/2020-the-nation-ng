Mavin Records singer, Divine ‘Rema’ Ikubor, has reacted to the scrutiny of his new song, ‘Woman’ saying he will never box himself to please anyone. Following the release of his new single, critics had taken the singer to the cleaners over his lyrics. Some of the critics claimed the lyrics were lewd and not comprehensible. Reacting to the critics, the 2020 BET awards nominee wrote, “I’m a proud Edo boy, I’ll forever celebrate my culture, I no go shame to use my Benni lamba, they can call me crazy all they want because they don’t understand it but I will never box myself to please anybody.” Continuing in his reaction, Rema said, “When I hear beats I must misbehave! So, get used to it.” Mavin’s head honcho, Don Jazzy also made a move to appease the critics while explaining his understanding of the lyrics. In a short video shared on his Instagram account, Don Jazzy played the song and translated the controversial lyrics saying, ‘Sa koloweko (Oweko) that’s easy naw that part just means say ‘Girls una day hear, we dey hear’; then Ikebe wame gear Gear one, gear two, gear three mean say ‘Bring Ikebe you want to say you don’t know what Ikebe is now? It means bring Ikebe come here fast fast, gear one gear two gear three.” Meanwhile, the singer has announced that his management will be taking over his social media accounts. He said “The Jonzing World Team is officially taking control of all social media accounts of @heisrema this will last for a while till REMA returns.
