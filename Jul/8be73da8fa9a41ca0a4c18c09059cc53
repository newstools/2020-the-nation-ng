The 2019/20 has been a season of transition for Chelsea. Working under new management in addition to losing their best player and having a transfer ban imposed on them, the Blues had already been shackled to a great extent before their campaign even began. However, if there was one department that was touted to be the saving grace in a young side, it was midfield. For much of the season, that has indeed proven to be true. Jorginho enjoyed a splendid first half of the campaign, which, in turn, helped him gain admirers at Stamford Bridge and beyond. Mateo Kovacic joined permanently and has arguably been Chelsea’s Player of the Season. Mason Mount was a largely unknown player but has carved out a place for himself in the first-team setup, while Ross Barkley has managed to chip in with a few solid performances as well. Finally, there was N’Golo Kante, who, before this season, had arguably been Chelsea’s best player after Eden Hazard after arriving from Leicester City in the summer of 2016. In fact, such has been Kante’s impact in the blue of Chelsea that extraordinary would be a rather understatement. In fact, even when he was converted into a box-to-box midfielder, the Frenchman did what he has always done in his career – overcoming obstacles to excel after initial hiccups, adding layers to his game. However, what has ensued over the last 11 months has turned 2019/20 into a season of horror for Kante. While he has still been consistent more often than not, injuries have set him back a great extent, forcing him to miss as many as 17 games this term. But, could this be the final memory of Kante as a Chelsea player? After all, reports claim that Chelsea are willing to sell him this summer.
