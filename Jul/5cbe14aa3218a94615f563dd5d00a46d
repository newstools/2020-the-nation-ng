The All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate in Edo State, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, yesterday called for violence-free campaigns, ahead of the September 19 election. He felicitated with Governor Godwin Obaseki on his 63rd birthday. Ize-Iyamu, in a statement to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Benin, wished Obaseki God’s blessings. He said: “By divine coincidence, we will be contesting again on different political platforms for the opportunity to lead our people and serve the state. “God appears to have arranged musical chairs for both of us, bringing me to APC, which I helped to form and on whose platform  you contested in 2016, and taking you to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), where I previously contested and where you have now expressed your preference. “Let the will of God be done. I assure you that my wish is that we have campaigns devoid of rancour and violence. “Edo people need a governor that will help to unify the state, douse political tension and focus on development of the state. “As leaders, you and I, including other aspirants, have the opportunity and responsibility to make things better and ensure that our contest is marked by democratic values that drive high standards of behaviour.”
