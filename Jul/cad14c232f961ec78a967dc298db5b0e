Prof.  Olawuyi, a professor of environmental law and Vice-Chair of the International Law Association (ILA), stated this during a webinar organized by the Nigerian Institute of Advanced Legal Studies (NIALS), in partnership with the ILA. The workshop, themed, “Progressive Realisation of SDGs in Nigeria during and Post COVID-19”, featured eminent speakers and experts, including the Director General of NIALS, Prof. Muhammad Tawfiq Ladan, Prof.  Robert Home, Emeritus Professor of Land Law and Urban Management, Anglia Ruskin University, United Kingdom, Dr. Nkechikwu Valerie Azinge, Lecturer in Law, University of Lincoln, UK, as well as senior scholars at NIALS, including Prof. Animi S. Temple, Franscisca Nlerum, Irekpitan Okukpon, and Osatohanmwen Eruaga. In his keynote remarks, Olawuyi noted: “The SDGs provide important tools for countries to fight all invisible enemies. The SDGs are built on the idea of turning disasters and challenges to opportunities. To ensure that economic recovery efforts leave no one behind, there is an urgent need to make the SDGs the basis and foundation of all post-COVID recovery plans, including economic planning, research, education and rule-making in Nigeria.”
