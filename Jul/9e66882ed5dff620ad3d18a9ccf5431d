Plateau State Governor Simon Bako Lalong has ordered the State Executive Council members to undergo COVID-19 test, following the case of a commissioner, who tested positive to the virus. He stated that after submitting themselves for the test, they should immediately proceed on self-isolation beginning from on Wednesday. Lalong’s directive followed the result of a member of the State Executive Council and Commissioner for Commerce and Industry Abe Aku, who tested positive for the virus after he carried out the test. A statement issued by Commissioner of Information and Communication, Da Manjang, indicated said: “Based on the governor’s directive, specimens of the commissioners are to be taken and forwarded to the COVID-19 Laboratory at the National Veterinary Research Institute (NVRI), Vom for testing.” Manjang explained: “During the period and pending the outcome of the results, members of the public are advised to be guided by unnecessary visits to members of the State Executive Council while they isolate. “This action is to not only prevent the possible spread of the disease, but also show leadership by example.” Lalong and his family had earlier carried out the test and all of them tested negative. The governor has also warned against stigmatisation, saying that COVID-19 is not a death sentence and only continuous testing will reveal the rate of infection and facilitate treatment to save lives.
