 MEMBERS of civil society groups under the aegis of Joint Forces for the Defence of Democracy (JOFDES), yesterday protested in Benin and its environs against Governor Godwin Obaseki’s alleged move to obtain N20billion loan for his re-election campaign. JOFDES, through its leaders, Osewmengie Isere, a lawyer; and Kola Edokpayi, said the Obaseki administration had no justification to obtain another N20billion loan that would become a burden to Edo people and the unborn generations. JOFDES said: “Just some weeks to the September 19 governorship election, Obaseki of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is making a desperate attempt to secure another loan from the stock market. “The most shocking part of it is that Obaseki is about taking the loan, when Edo State currently services the $150 million facility his administration obtained from the World Bank. “Edo State’s domestic debt profile stands at N84.76billion. Edo State has the highest domestic debt in Nigeria, second only to Lagos State. Edo State has the highest external debt in the entire Southsouth, with an external debt of $257.92 million, as at March 2020. The Edo governor, reacting through his Special Adviser on Media and Communication Strategy, Mr. Crusoe Osagie, accused the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, of sponsoring the protest. He said such action would not distract the electorate. The APC standard-bearer, responding to Obaseki’s allegation through the Chairman, Edo State APC Media Campaign Council, Prince John Mayaki, said it was ludicrous and insulting to the people of Edo State known for their independence of thought, for the governor to suggest that the anger the protesters expressed on the streets of Benin over the N20billion loan he was trying to obtain for his collapsing campaigns was done at his behest.
