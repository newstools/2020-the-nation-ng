Sadio Mane helped Liverpool keep alive their bid to set a new Premier League points record as the champions beat Aston Villa 2-0 while struggling West Ham twice blew the lead in a draw at Newcastle on Sunday. Jurgen Klopp’s side are hoping to break Manchester City’s Premier League record of 100 points and second-half strikes from Mane and Curtis Jones ensured they still have a chance to shatter that mark. Back at Anfield for the first time since clinching the English title last week, Liverpool were lacklustre for long periods as they looked to bounce back from Thursday’s 4-0 thrashing at Manchester City. But Senegal winger Mane broke struggling Villa’s stubborn resistance in the 71st minute, smashing Naby Keita’s pass in off the underside of the crossbar from close range. Mane’s 20th goal in all competitions this season was followed by Jones’ 89th-minute strike. Jones netted from 12 yards for his first Premier League goal, just 24 hours after the promising midfielder signed a new contract. Meanwhile, Liverpool needs 12 points from their remaining five games to surpass City’s 100-point total from 2017-18. Villa remains in the relegation zone, one point from safety as they battle to avoid an immediate return to the Championship. Second-placed City visits Southampton in Sunday’s late game.
