Seventy- year- old Mohammed Sani escaped lynching when he was caught raping a nine year old girl in his shop. Sani, who was caught red handed by neighbours who heard the scream of the girl, was made to walk gal naked to the police station in Chanchaga. The incident occurred in Kasuwan Dare in the Chanchaga Local Government Area of Niger state. The suspect had asked the victim to meet him at his tailor shop to give her a gift, which he got for her. Sani, whose shop had an inner room, dragged the victim and raped her. Her screams attracted people around who waited outside the closed shop to see what was happening. Unaware that he had been caught, the suspect, after raping the victim, came outside the shop to meet the crowd waiting for him. Searching his shop, some of the women saw the victim crying with blood dripping out from her legs. The suspect was dragged outside with his trousers and made to walk the street with the people calling him names while throwing stones and sachet water at him. When taken to the Niger State Police Command, the suspect confessed it was the work of the devil, saying he did not know when he raped the girl. “I knew she is an underage girl; but cannot tell how it all happened, I think it is devil’s work, otherwise, why should I make love to a little girl of this nature, it is  an abominable thing to do to human kind. “I still cannot understand why that should happen in the first place, I think I don’t deserve mercy at all, let the law take its course. I am ready for it, is quite unfortunate,” he said. The Police Public Relations Officer, Wasiu Abiodun, said the suspect had confessed to the crime during interrogation, adding that he would soon be arraigned in court.
