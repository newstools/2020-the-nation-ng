 The Federal Government has urged manufacturers not to relent in the production of face mask, sanitizers and others so the impact of the COVID-19 does not cripple the economy. The Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Adeniyi Adebayo, gave the advice in Abuja during an award presentation to members of the Emergency Operations Centre of the Committee on Sustainable Production and Delivery of Essential Commodities during COVID-19. Adebayo assured that the government would do all it can to ensure that the impact of the pandemic does not cripple the economy. ‘’Manufacturers will be fully supported so they are not discouraged.The ministry has set a pace because we made sure livelihood was eased during the lockdown period,’’he said.  He added  that the government had put up quality policies to come out of the coronavirus pandemic very strongly, this is  against predictions of economic doom by some international bodies as more support would be provided to the manufacturing and other key sectors of the economy to boost their productivity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Adebayo commended the committee for effectively discharging their mandate, stating that based on feedbacks received during the exercise, it is now imperative that Nigeria has the capacity to produce some of the products it needed. “As you all acknowledge, the lockdown that we have instituted to curb the spread of the virus resulted in a number of casualties across board as jobs were lost and supply was disrupted and led to shortfall in movement of goods and services. Our manufacturing sector continues to be our key focus as our economy continues to grow. From the market intelligence findings, more than ever before, we need to boost local production of key commodities required.
