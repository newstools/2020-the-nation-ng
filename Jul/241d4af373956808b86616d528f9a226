 THE Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) says it has lifted the ban on campaigns by parties ahead of the September 19 governorship election in Edo State. INEC Head of Voter Education Mr. Timidi Wariowei told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Benin on Monday that the campaigns officially began on June 21. He said: “Campaigns have officially started in the state. Campaign starts 90 days to election and it started on June 21.”ariowei said the office had taken delivery of some non-sensitive materials and distributed same to the 18 local governments. “We distributed materials early because the office we are occupying has a small storage capacity. “The storage facility cannot accommodate all the materials. So, as the materials come, we dispatch to our local government offices. “The non-sensitive materials we have received so far are not complete, so as they come in batches we distribute because of lack of space to keep them,” he said. Wariowei said the total registered voters as at 2019 was 2,210,534, while uncollected PVCs stood at 483,868. NAN reports that INEC has cleared and displayed list of candidates of 14 registered parties, including the All Progressives Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party, being the major contenders, ahead of the election.
