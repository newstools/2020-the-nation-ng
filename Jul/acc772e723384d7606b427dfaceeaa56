 MOSES Chiwueze Harolds, 19, has been designing hand bags since he was 15. Harolds, who started the business in SS1, is the chief executive of HF Bagware Enterprise. For Harolds, who started  bag-making in 2016, age is truly no barrier. He was encouraged to learn bag-making by his father who felt owning a business was viable. But the road to designing handbags is not straight.  It requires creative, commercial and technical expertise. Thus he underwent an apprenticeship during his junior secondary school days, adding fashion designing to his training. Harolds spent time at the workshop after school. For him, the time he spent learning bag-making was important. He admitted that, initially, he didn’t enjoy the experience, but after much practice, he began to see the prospect of turning it into a long-term venture. The thoughtfulness behind the designs are what make his bags special. The business has blossomed with his products selling through retail outlets. He has employed two people. He has an online outlet, where he gets steady orders. His greatest accomplishment has been building the brand. He really can’t imagine doing anything else. Like others that are successful, Harolds is passionate about designs, structure and aesthetics. He chases trends. He designs for people who buy for lasting value. His value is persistence, a characteristic that his dad taught him. His father, Mr. Moses Chiwueze, said Nigeria needed young entrepreneurs. While he encourages parents to motivate their children to study courses, such as medicine, law and accountancy, Chiwueze says the reality is that there are limited job opportunities for those in such professions. The answer, according to him, is self-employment. Hence, he advises his children to learn skills alongside their careers. With the state of the economy, Chiwueze, an IT consultant, said it pays to shape children into job creators and successful entrepreneurs.
