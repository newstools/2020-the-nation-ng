Igbo Youths Movement (IYM) has called on Nigerians from every region to support the recent call by the Yoruba Summit Group for early restructuring of Nigeria in order to save the country. The Founder of IYM, Evang. Elliot Ugochukwu-Uko, told The Nation yesterday that Nigeria is at a crossroads and warned that only the truth can save the country. According to IYM leader: “For how much longer do we have to continue the self-deception and false hope? Our country isn’t working and will never work this way. What are we waiting for,” he asked. Also in a statement he signed by the founder of IYM, Uko said: “Delay in restructuring Nigeria is a great disservice to the fatherland; which is why I plead with Nigerians from every region to identify with and support the recent call by the Yoruba Summit Group for all to join hands and drive the early restructuring of Nigeria in order to save Nigeria. Time is running out.” Outlining the recent killings in Kaduna and the rest of Northwest, Boko Haram killings in the Northeast, bloody clashes between herders and farmers, kidnappings and general sense of insecurity across the country, failed promises and hunger, Uko, who is also the Secretary, Eastern Consultative Assembly (ECA) and the Deputy Secretary, Igbo Leaders of Thought (ILT) asked, “for how long would we live this way; for how long?”
