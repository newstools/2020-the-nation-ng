 TO prevent the community spread of HIV/AIDS during the Covid-19 global pandemic, the Lagos State AIDS Control Agency (LSACA) has started the training of artisans. This, the agency explained, is necessary to quicken the pace towards eradicating HIV/AIDS in the state. The training, which targets the executives of the Nigeria Automobile Technician Association (NATA), Lagos State chapter, is designed to achieve the global epidemic control of HIV/AIDS by 2020 through the UNAIDS 90-90-90 initiative (i.e. 90 per cent of people living with the virus should know their status; 90 per cent of HIV-positive individuals should be initiated on anti-retroviral (ART) drugs; while 90 per cent of individuals on anti-retroviral (ART) drugs should achieve viral suppression so that total eradication can become a reality by 2030). LSACA Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Dr. Monsurat Adeleke said Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who doubles as the chairman of LSACA, has approved the release of funds for HIV/AIDS campaign for the Lagos State chapter of NATA. “The current administration is dedicated to curbing HIV Transmission in the community, with a strong focus on youth development and well-being. This professional group was selected because of their daily interactions with community members. Despite that there is an ongoing pandemic, NATA members still provide services for other residents, such as healthcare workers, journalists, and police who patronise them for mobility through the repairs or servicing of their vehicles,” she said. The LSACA chief urged the participants, who were drawn from the 20 local government areas of the state to serve as HIV agents of change in their communities, to assist in cascading the knowledge acquired during the training to their apprentices, which are mostly the youth.
