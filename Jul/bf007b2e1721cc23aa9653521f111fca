Bayern Munich have confirmed the signing of Leroy Sane from Manchester City on a five-year deal thought to be worth around £55m. The 24-year-old has been heavily linked with a move to the German champions for more than a year now, and City boss Pep Guardiola this week confirmed that a deal was close. The Germany international, who has managed just 24 minutes of football this season after picking up a serious knee ligament injury in August, has now penned a long-term deal which will keep him at the Allianz Arena until 2025. “FC Bayern is a great club with big goals – and these goals suit me as well. I’m looking forward to the new challenge and can’t wait to train with the team,” Sane told the club’s official website. “I know Hansi Flick from the U21 national team, we had a very good relationship there. I want to win as many trophies as possible with FC Bayern, and the Champions League is the top priority.” Bayern CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge added: “We’re very happy to welcome Leroy Sane to FC Bayern. He is an outstanding player who has proven his qualities over the past few years, especially in the national team. “Our goal is to gather the best German players at FC Bayern and the signing of Leroy emphasises this goal. I would like to congratulate Hasan Salihamidzic on successfully concluding the transfer.” Sane scored 39 goals and assisted 45 more in 135 appearances for Man City across all competitions, winning two Premier League titles, an FA Cup and two League Cups during his four-year stay.
