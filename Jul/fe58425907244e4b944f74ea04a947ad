The 12 aspirants jostling for the All Progressives Congress (APC) ticket in Ondo State governorship primary slated for July 20 have been cleared by the party’s Screening Appeal Committee. All got the nod Wednesday night. The Tijjani Tumsa-led nine-man Screening Committee had before yesterday cleared all but one of the 12 aspirants. The committee did not give the name of the disqualified aspirant. But in a statement issued in Abuja, an official of the party, Yekini Nabena, said the appeal committee has submitted its report to the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led APC Caretaker/Extra-ordinary National Convention Planning Committee. Nabena said the APC Screening Appeal Committee cleared all the twelve aspirants to contest the Party’s forthcoming primary election. Those cleared to participate in the primary are: incumbent Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu; Ambassador Olusola Iji; Odimayo Okunjemi John; Olayide Owolabi Adelami; Kekemeke Duerimini Isaacs; Olusola Oke Alex; Ifeoluwa Olusola Oyedele; Mrs. Olajumoke Olubusola Anifowoshe; Awodeyi Akinsehinwa Akinola; Adetula Olubukola Olarogba; Dr. Abraham Olusegun Michael and Dr. Nathaniel O. Adojutelegan. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has fixed October 10 for the governorship election in the Sunshine State.
