A woman who appeared to cough on another woman’s child because she did not social distance inside a store was said to have lost her position with a California school district. Oak Grove School District said the unnamed woman did not work with the school district in San Jose, California, anymore. “We want to inform our community that the District employee who was alleged to have engaged in this conduct is no longer an employee of our District,” said Oak Grove school district in a statement. “The Oak Grove School District’s highest priority is the safety of our students and the well-being of all of the children in the community we serve. We do not tolerate conduct from any employee that compromises any child’s safety.” The statement did not say whether the woman decided to leave her position, or was dismissed. San Jose’s police department said last month that the woman “removed her face mask, got close to the baby’s face, and coughed 2-3 times” whilst inside a Yogurtland store on 12 June. The police department then published CCTV video showing the moment when the woman moved toward a child and coughed. Mireya Mora, the child’s mother, told NBC Bay Area News last month that she believed the woman’s actions were racially motivated because she is Hispanic. (www.newsnow.co.uk)
