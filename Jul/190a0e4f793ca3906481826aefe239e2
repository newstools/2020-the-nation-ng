Two persons were Friday night confirmed dead and two others missing after a 14-passenger boat capsized in Lagos. It was gathered that the boat which left Ebute-Ero for Ikorodu around 8pm, upturned shortly after it took off, throwing all passengers into the water. Sources said 10 of the passengers were rescued from the water hours after while the captain and another passenger where yet to be found. Confirming the incident, Director General (DG) Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) Dr. Femi Oke-Osanyintolu told The Nation at about 11:15pm that search and rescue operations were ongoing. He said the night boat ride was in violation of restrictions on nocturnal water travels in the state. Oke-Osanyintolu said the rescue of those found was done under extremely challenging nightfall conditions. “We have rescued 10 persons alive and recovered two bodies. Two others including the captain are still missing,” he said
