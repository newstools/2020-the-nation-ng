 RIVER State Governor Nyesom Wike has sacked a Permanent Secretary, Mr. Sunny Okere, with immediate effect for flouting and obstructing the enforcement of the COVID-19 guidelines. He said the sacked permanent secretary had the temerity to chase away officials of the state Ministry of Health, who went to Oyigbo to enforce the established guidelines on public burials. A statement by the Commissioner for Information and Communications, Paulinus Nsirim, said the governor spoke yesterday in a statewide broadcast. Wike said his action against the permanent secretary would act as a lesson to other public officers, who might wish to flout the guidelines. The governor also appealed to residents to take personal responsibility to curb the virus spread. He said with the beginning of inter-state travels and domestic flights, residents must be cautious in relating with friends and relatives coming from heavily impacted areas like Lagos and Abuja in line with the established protocol of 14 days Isolation. He said as at Wednesday, the COVID-19 samples collected were 4,573; samples tested, 3,871; confirmed cases, 1235; discharged cases, 810; active cases, 382 and deaths, 43. Wike said: “Those who experience symptoms of fever, cough, loss of smell or taste and shortness of breath, among others, should present themselves for appropriate treatment at the expense of the state government. “Furthermore, in the face of increasing infections and systemic risk to public health and safety, most residents have continued to disregard the mitigating protocols with reckless abandon. “Public and private transporters, business owners and churches are refusing to adhere to the relevant protocols.”
