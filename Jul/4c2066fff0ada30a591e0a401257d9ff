Caleb University at Imota in Lagos State, one of the select institutions to begin e-learning without interrupting its academic calendar, has successfully conducted academic, training and other regular activities on its online platform. The students’ enrolment on the university’s e-learning platform has moved from 8 per cent on April 20 to almost 100 per cent by the beginning of July 2020. To achieve excellent service delivery, academic workers have undergone five different training sessions to gain mastery of teaching and assessment tools available on the e-learning platform. Besides periodic guidelines circulated to them, a general training session and college and departmental-level trainings have been organised for the students. The institution, early in the semester, granted its students at undergraduate and postgraduate levels and lecturers, free access to various e-library resources, to enhance research, learning and teaching experience and capacity.
