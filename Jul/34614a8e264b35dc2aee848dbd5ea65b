LAPO Microfinance Bank (MfB) will continue to empower low-income earners within the communities. In a statement, the bank said its core mandate does not include settling insurance claims. LAPO MfB clarified that in the last five years, the aggregation of claims settlement by various insurance firms that it work stood at N1.88 billion. The bank said a report that attributed the claims settlement to the company was not true. “LAPO MfB is a micro finance bank and not purported to play the role of insurance company. We remain committed to our over 30 years of operation, first as a non-profit with mandate of social and economic empowerment of low-income households in Nigeria and beyond,” the bank said.
