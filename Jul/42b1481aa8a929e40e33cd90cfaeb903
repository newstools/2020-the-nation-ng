Suspected internet fraudster Ramon Abass alias Hushpuppi is innocent of the charges brought against him by various security agencies, his legal representative has said. Abass, who was arrested recently by police in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, and extradited to the United States to face fraud charges, was widely reported to have scammed several people of billions of dollars, alongside his accomplices. But Gal Pitssezky of Pitssezky and Berliner denied that the Instagram personality is guilty of any of the charges against him. Speaking during an interview with Forbes, Pitsseky said “Ramon Abass, aka Hushpuppi, is absolutely not guilty of all the charges they are accusing him of”. “Abass was running a very legitimate business and had a very legitimate Instagram account and did not take part in any scam or fraud; he is an entrepreneur, he has real estate business, he was promoting brands. That’s how he was very legitimately making his money”. Abass’ extradition to the U.S. is said to be in connection with multiple charges of fraud.
