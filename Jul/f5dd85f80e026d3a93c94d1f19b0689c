Nigerian winger Samuel Chukwueze will most likely be thrown into todayâ€™s all-important match for Villarrea in the crucial La Liga match against Real Madrid. The 21-year-old came from the bench and made an impact in their 2-1 loss to Real Sociedad on Monday but reports suggest Coach Javi Calleja would be starting the Super Eagles star against Real Madrid. Already, Villarreal has lost the ticket to feature in the UEFA Champions League while they will be aiming for a spot in the Europa League. Villarreal will be without Paco Alcacer due to injury, and there are expected to be changes from the defeat to Sociedad last time out, with Mario Gaspar and Chukwueze also likely to make the XI. Madrid will again be without the services of defenders Marcelo and Nacho against Villarreal through injury, while Luka Jovic remains a doubt, having been forced to self-isolate after coming into contact with a friend who had recently tested positive for coronavirus. Zidane otherwise has a full squad to choose from, and there are expected to be changes from the side that started against Granada, with Marco Asensio and Eden Hazard both in line to feature. Asensio and Hazard could replace Isco and Federico Valverde in the starting XI, with Luka Modric, Casemiro and Toni Kroos starting as the midfield three in a 4-3-3 formation. Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo Goes are also options for Zidane in the final third, although the fact that Hazard did not play against Granada suggests that the Belgian has been saved for this match.
