 In a unanimous  decision,the Court of Appeal in Abuja yesterday  affirmed the election of Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State. A five-man panel of the court dismissed  the four appeals challenging the decisions of the election tribunal which had  upheld Bello’s election. The panel led by Justice Adamu Jauro, held that the appellants were unable to establish  their claim that the Kogi State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal erred in upholding Bello’s election. The appellate court  found the cases lacking  merit.  It  said   it found no reason to dislodge the decision of the tribunal that the petitioners failed to prove their case . The appellate court held that there was no basis for it to tamper with the result of the election as declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) which was affirmed by the election tribunal. The  appeals were filed by the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP), the Actions People’s Party (APP), the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the Democratic People’s Party (DPP) and their candidates. Bello was re-elected as Kogi State Governor as the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in November 2019. According to INEC, Bello scored 406,222 votes to defeat his closest rival,  Musa Wada (of the PDP) who scored189,704 votes.
