Hey ho what a thrill Grant the cops the right to kill Classical chokehold, karate-crush Pummel your prey in a lawful rush   On the worldâ€™s highest throne Is a bloated Tyrant Who stabs our ears with his phony rant On his fumbling crown a glittering stone   Two plagues there are in this our land, In their trembling thousands the people say One mows us down in its viral sway The other is the Tyrant and his groveling band   Food from the hungry Drug from the dying Brazen blackmail and naked bribery Never, never far from his grave undoing   The Law, he says, is a stumbling block Made for the weak and then the humble For those like him from the basest rock The world may tilt and or forever tumble   But the strong also stray The rich sometimes cry The giant up the sky His/Her feet are made of clay
