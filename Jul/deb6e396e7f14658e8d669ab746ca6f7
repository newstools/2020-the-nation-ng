The Federal High Court sitting in Abuja on Wednesday adjourned the trial of suspected kidnap kingpin Hamisu Bala (aka Wadume) until October 13. Justice Binta Nyako adjourned the matter following the cross-examination of Inspector Samuel Habila and the evidence-in-chief of Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Bawa James, both prosecution witnesses. During cross-examination by the defence counsel, Habila told the court that he was in the team that investigated Wadume and six other defendants but that he did visit Ibi in Taraba State. The witness said the evidence he gave in court bordered on the role he played at the Force Headquarters in Abuja, adding that seven members of the team investigated the crime. Habila also told the court that he was not an exhibit keeper at the Force Headquarters, neither was he a specialist in weapons. Also during cross-examination, the witness told the court that Wadume communicated to Uba Bala through Auwalu Bala and that Uba did not know Wadumeâ€™s whereabouts. James told the court that he was the leader of the team set up to investigate the alleged kidnap. According to Bawa James, Uba Bala was arrested in Ibi while the other defendants were arrested in different locations.
