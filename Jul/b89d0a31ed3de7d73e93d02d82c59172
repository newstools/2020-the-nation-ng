In a letter of commendation to Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, NLC President Ayuba Wabba said: “We write to commend the Federal Government for its recent decision to release N7.45 billion Accrued Rights and Benefits into the Retirement Saving Account (RSA) of Federal retirees covering April and May 2019. “This responsive and responsible move by the Federal Government has come at a very critical time, considering the adversity imposed on our retirees and pensioners by the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. “While appreciating this gesture, we urge you to also consider the plight of retirees from June 2019 to July 2020.”
