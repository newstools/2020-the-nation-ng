A former Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) President Dr Olisa Agbakoba (SAN) and a former military governor of Kaduna State, Col. Dangiwa Umar (rtd), on Thursay said they were not part of the formation of a new political party, the National Consultative Front. The party was midwifed on Wednesday by a group of politicians, Labour leaders and human rights activists, with Agbakoba named as one of the arrowheads. But, in a statement on Thursday, Agbakoba said: “My attention has been drawn to a widely circulated story that I am part of a new political movement known as the National Consultative Front. “Without prejudice to the need for such a political movement, I want to place it on record that I was not consulted and so I am not part of the National Consultative Front.” Umar said: “This is not true. I was never consulted and I am not part of the National Consultative Front.” The founding leaders were said to also include Femi Falana (SAN), Dr Oby Ezekwesili and former Central Bank Deputy Governor Mailafia Obadiah, whose goal is to have a party with an ideological outlook and mobilise Nigerians to take power as the African National Congress (ANC) did in South Africa.
