 SUPERSPORT viewers on DStv and GOtv can settle in for a historic FA Cup final to be played on August 1. The FA Cup, which is the oldest knockout competition in world football, will close the 2019-20 top-flight English domestic seasons with an all-London encounter between Arsenal and Chelsea at Wembley Stadium. The match will air at 5:30pm on SuperSport 3 DStv channel 223 and Select 3 GOtv channel 36. Arsenal upset Manchester City in the semifinal on the penultimate weekend of July, with Gabonese star Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scoring both goals in a 2-0 victory. The Gunners will be chasing a record-extending 14th FA Cup title and hoping this will be a repeat of the 2017 final in which they defeated Chelsea 2-1. Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta believed his side has turned a corner after a roller-coaster ride of a season following the win over City in the semi-final and he’s hopeful victory on Saturday would convince Aubameyang to remain with the club, following months of speculation over the striker’s future.
