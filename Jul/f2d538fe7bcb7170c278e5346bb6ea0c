Federal Capital Territory Football Association chairman Adam Mouktar Mohammed has tasked the police to build a comprehensive database of sex offenders in Nigeria. Speaking during a special hiking program to create awareness against rape in Abuja, Mohammed said: “It is rather disturbing that the police do not have a database of sex offenders in the country” With the theme ‘Hiking Against Rape’ under the auspices of Fame Foundation, the FA boss said that research has shown that 93% of these sex crimes are perpetrated by those within a victim’s circle. He added: “The police said that from January 2020, they have recorded 700 rape cases in Nigeria, but that’s not accurate because it ought to be far more than that.  “It’s crucial in this fight against this silent pandemic that we are able to name and shame rapists. “We also have to go beyond the rhetoric by providing support structure for victims like safe houses and more serious government legislations so as to stop this heinous crime.” “This often starts from the home and so we have to be vigilant and watchful in schools and offices,” he cautioned. The ‘Hiking Against Rape’ programme included accounts by rape survivors. Rape cases have been on the increase in Nigeria with various campaigns advocating for stiffer punishments for rapists.
