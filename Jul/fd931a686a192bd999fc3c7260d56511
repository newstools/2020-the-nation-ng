Four policemen who allegedly tortured a man to death have been arraigned at a Magistrate’s Court in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital. Ayogu Fidelis, Rose Georgewill, Eke Chibuzor and Egbunefu Felix, who were members of Eagle Crack, a special squad, reportedly killed Chima Ikwunado and inflicted injuries on three other detainees. The command dismissed them for unprofessional conduct. The suspects were arraigned yesterday on a seven-count charge of murder, conspiracy to commit murder, and unlawful assault. The suspects pleaded not guilty, and Chief Magistrate, Promise Iruanya, who declined to grant them bail, remanded them in a correctional facility. Iroanya adjourned the case to September 19 for legal advice.
