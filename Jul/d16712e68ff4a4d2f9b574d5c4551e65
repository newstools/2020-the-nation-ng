Two suspects have been picked up by police in Niger State in connection with the rape and brutal murder of an 18-year-old girl Hauwa Saidu. Abdulkadir Ibrahim, 25, and Abubakar Idris, 29, reportedly admitted luring the teenager to a place where they raped and killed her. Police said the suspects gave their victim a ride on their motorcycle but instead of dropping her off at her destination, diverted to the scene of the crime where they killed her and dismembered her body. Ibrahim said, “We did not know we would be caught. We have been looking for someone to use for rituals and when she approached our motorcycle for a lift, we saw it as an opportunity that should not be missed. “ Police spokesman ASP Wasiu Abiodun said the suspects led them to the crime scene, adding that investigation was ongoing.
