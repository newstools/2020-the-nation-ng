Two Big Brother Naija Lockdown Housemates, Neo and Bright O have been fined for microphone infringement. On Thursday, Neo and Brighto were caught engaging in a late-night conversation without their microphones worn. Their action was followed by an immediate fine by Biggie himself. In Biggieâ€™s House, one bad behaviour leading to a fine for a Housemate directly affects the whole House and shopping for the week. However, Biggie asked Neo and Bright O to apologise to their fellow Housemates for incurring a fine before reversing the action. The offenders were pardoned by Biggie, who lifted the penalty and forgave the two housemates.
