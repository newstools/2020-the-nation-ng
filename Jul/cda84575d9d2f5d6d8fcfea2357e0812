 LAGOS state government’s healthcare delivery received a major boost recently with donation maternal health medications Misoclear by Marie Stopes International Organisation Nigeria (MSION). Misoclear is a brand of socially marketed misoprostol used in the management of postpartum hemorrhage in women after childbirth. Justifying the need for the donation, Mr. Abimbola Faloye, the South West Regional Manager, MSION, stated that the donated medicines will help more women stay alive, thus, contribute to Lagos state’s effort at improving maternal health. He expressed concern that Nigeria has an unacceptably high maternal mortality ratio (MMR) of 451 deaths per 100,000 live births and through this donation in Lagos and similar donations to state governments, MSION is supporting Nigeria’s effort at meeting the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) to reduce global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100, 000 live births by 2030. While receiving the products on behalf of the Lagos State Ministry of Health, Dr. Mrs. Folasade Oludara, the Director, Family Health & Nutrition, thanked Marie Stopes Nigeria for the kind gesture. She noted that maternal and child health is a key health area of focus for the state government and the state appreciates the contributions and partnership of MSION in facilitating improved access to sexual reproductive health to all requiring it. Earlier in his statement, Mr. Faloye noted that all MSION supported facilities across Nigeria have remained open even during the Covid-19 lockdown period to ensure every woman requiring service can access care.
