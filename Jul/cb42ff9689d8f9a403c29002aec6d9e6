The Murtala Muhammed Airport Terminal Two (MMA 2) re-opened for domestic flights on Wednesday amid poor passengers turn out. As early as 6.00 am, airport workers, airline personnel and security officials were already at their duty posts but only a few passengers showed up at the departure hall. The departure hall remained scanty as the few passengers filed through security and health checks.
