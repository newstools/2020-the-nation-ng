 The Minister of Youths and Sports Development Sunday Dare has assured that sporting activities would soon restart in the country. This much was said yesterday in Abuja by the Ministry’s Permanent Secretary Gabriel Aduda while receiving on behalf of the minister 10,000 face masks produced by the members of the National Youth Service Corp (NYSC) for athletes towards curbing the spread of the COVID-19 at the restart of sports activities in the country. He commended the NYSC for the initiative adding that the ministry is working tirelessly with other relevant agencies to ensure sporting activities return under the necessary COVID-19 protocols. “We are here to receive this donation from NYSC towards sporting activities in Nigeria. The truth of the matter is that we are still working with the government, the Presidential Task Force, NCDC, the Ministry of Health to ensure a return to sporting activities,” he said.  “You will agree with me that all the European leagues have opened up, the American League is opening up soon and we think it is time for us to do the same. We need to join the rest of the world. We will not allow the pandemic to disrupt our lives further”. “The ministry has gone ahead in conjunction with all the federations, the National Council of Sports to put together a very strong code sports COVID-19 protocols and practices. The code is intended to guide sporting activities once we get permission from the government to resume.” Earlier, DG of NYSC Brigadier General Shuaibu Ibrahim, said the 10,000 face mask by the Corp members is aimed towards a successful hosting of the 2020 National Sports Festival later this year. “The face mask is our own contribution towards the hosting of the 2020 National Sports Festival (NSF) and other sporting activities in the country,” he said.
