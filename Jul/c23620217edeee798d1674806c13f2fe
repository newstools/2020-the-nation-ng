National Parents Teachers Association of Nigeria (NAPTAN), the umbrella body of pupils’ parents in all schools nationwide, as well as the Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT), on Thursday expressed shock at Federal Government’s decision to backpedal on the reopening of schools to enable final year pupils sit for their examinations. The parents and NUT said they had started making arrangements on how to provide non-pharmaceutical interventions for final year students at the end of a stakeholders’ consultative meeting with the Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba. They expressed dismay that an announcement by the Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, came shortly that the schools would remain closed indefinitely. NUT’s Secretary General Mike Ene, in a telephone interview, told The Nation that the union would consult with its members before taking a position on the new development. Also, the Oyo State government has insisted it will keep its schools open and allow pupils to continue learning, despite Federal Government’s announcement that the WASCE examination would not hold in Nigeria. Education, Science and Technology Commissioner Olasunkanmi Olaleye told The Nation last night that Federal Government’s decision would not make the state reconsider its stand on schools’ reopening and learning.
