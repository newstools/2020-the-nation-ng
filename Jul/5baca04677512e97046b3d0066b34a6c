 As part of his administration’s commitment to improving access to electricity for sustainable economic development,  Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has sealed a pact with the United Agency for International Development (USAID) to launch the State Integrated Resource Plan. It is under the Power Africa – Nigeria Power Sector Program initiative (PA-NPSP). Sanwo-Olu who appended his signature in Lagos on Tuesday said: “To improve access to electricity in sub-Saharan Africa, there is no better place to start than in Nigeria. “The Integrated Resource Plan is a priority initiative for the Lagos State Government as it underpins our power reform strategy to ensure that access to reliable and affordable electricity of residents becomes a reality.”  Commissioner of Energy and Mineral Resources, Mr Olalere Odusote, stated that the partnership was a significant milestone. “It is impossible to have a sustainable economic plan without a strategic energy plan,” he said. According to him, the aim is to deliver affordable, reliable and sustainable electricity to Lagos residents, which he said is a key enabler for the vision of making Lagos a 21st-century economy. “The Integrated Resource Plan will be a sustainable, long-term electrification plan for Lagos,” Odusote stressed.
