Carlo Ancelotti reportedly said he took Alex Iwobi off in Monday’s EPL clash against Leicester City  as the Everton midfielder picked up a hamstring problem. Iwobi was withdrawn at half-time, with youngster Anthony Gordon coming on to take his place. The Nigerian had been quiet in the first 45 minutes but part of the reason for that may have been as he picked up an injury. “I wanted to use some fresh legs for the game,” Ancelotti told Sky sports. “Iwobi had a little problem on his hamstring so I took him out and after that I put on fresh players for the end of the game.”
