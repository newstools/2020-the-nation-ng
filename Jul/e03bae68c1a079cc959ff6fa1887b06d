 OVER 5,000 youths across the 18 local governments, under the aegis of the Edo Patriotic Youth Movement, have endorsed the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu. This has caused jitters in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Their endorsement, announced during a meeting between selected representatives of the group and the APC candidate, as well as other APC leaders, came on the back of similar endorsements from other youth groups in a week that witnessed high-profile resignations from the Obaseki-led government over electoral weakness, intimidation and lack of leadership. Receiving the endorsement alongside his running mate, Mallam Gani Audu, Pastor Ize-Iyamu thanked the youth and reassured them that his government would prioritise job creation and youth empowerment. He criticised the incumbent administration for implementing harsh policies and prolonged detention of the poor over their inability to pay unfair fines and taxes. Ize-Iyamu said: “I find it outrageous that instead of empowering youths, creating opportunities for them and engaging them directly in government projects, the current administration is instead disparaging and castigating them as lazy criminals. ”Government should solve problems, not lament, fold its arms and insult people. I have an agenda of what I will do; the incumbent has nothing to show after four years in office.”
