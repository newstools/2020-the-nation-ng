Doğan Türk Birliği forward, Razak Adegbite said he challenged himself during his trying time. The one-time highest goal scorer in the Nigeria Premier Football League currently plies his trade in Cyprus league where he’s scoring and making progress on weekly basis.  “I have played for four top teams in Nigeria before I left the country for better challenges, it was tough for me,” he lamented. “I faced some many challenges getting to where I am today but I thank God I was able to challenge my potentials, I never give up, and I always pray to God to give me the grace of testimony sometimes in my career.
