 BEING his final season for Sporting, Aruna Quadri is aiming to hold on to his unbeaten record by claiming the fifth Portuguese Table Tennis league title for Sporting Lisbon. Since teaming up with Sporting in 2016, Quadri has helped the team to claim all the titles at stake in the Portuguese league. In what will be his last match for the team, Quadri will tomorrow lead the team in the two-leg final holding at High Performance Center of Vila Nova de Gaia. “I will remain grateful to the management of Sporting for their support in the last four years that I joined them. It is going to be an emotional match for me this weekend because this will be my last match for the team and it is not only for Sporting, alone but for my fans in Portugal,” he said. He added that he is looking forward to end on a good note with the team having won the league title in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019. Already this year, he has led the team to claim this year’s Portuguese Cup. The final phase of the Portuguese national league started yesterday with GD Toledos battling GDCS Juncal in the two-day semifinal tie while Sporting will await the winner of the tie following the withdrawal of CD São Roque from the semifinal round.
