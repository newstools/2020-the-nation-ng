Immediate past National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Comrade Adams Oshiomhole has stated he returned to Edo to reclaim the state for APC. He declared that if Edo residents say yes and God say yes, no man born of a woman could say no. He was apparently referring to the September 19 governorship election mainly between APC’s Governorship Candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu and Governor Godwin Obaseki of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Oshiomhole, an ex-governor of Edo, who backed Obaseki against Ize-Iyamu in 2016, spoke on Saturday night in his Iyamho hometown near Auchi in Etsako West Local Government Area. He was addressing teeming supporters, who welcomed him from Abuja in his residence. The enthusiastic crowd waited for Oshiomhole for many hours at the main gate of Auchi Polytechnic before moving to Iyamho for the special address by the former Labour leader. Oshiomhole said: “I am back and ready for the job. The snake that entered our family home, God has driven the snake to where he belongs. I have come home to join you and start the process of reclaiming the house to the family of APC. “I have only one mission and I know it is our common mission, which is to bring Edo back to the path of sustainable development. “We shall bring back the era of red roof. We want to bring back roads with drainage. We want to bring back those lofty days when we engaged our youths and we mixed with the elders. “We want to return to the government of the people, by the people and for the people.”
