Some people have decided to dedicate a part of their lives to humanity. Following her emergence as the President of Rotary Club, Ikeja GRA, Lagos, last year, Sylvia Abdalla, also did her best to make a difference. Abdalla’s desire was to do more for society but the emergence of COVID-19 set many things in disarray. The club could not meet physically to deliberate and some projects had to be put on hold. A few days ago, Abdalla’s tenure as president ended and she passed the baton to the newly elected president.  She admitted that the 2019-2020 Rotary year had been interesting and challenging. She stated: “The year kicked off very well with the passing of the baton from where we as Rotarians were Inspired to Serve (in the previous year) to this year with a “Challenge to strengthen the many ways that Rotary Connects the World, building the connections that allow talented, thoughtful, and generous people to unite and take meaningful action through Rotary service” And this was our commitment.” Her tenure would be best remembered as the season the club commissioned the Rotary Public Image Project at Ikeja round about.
