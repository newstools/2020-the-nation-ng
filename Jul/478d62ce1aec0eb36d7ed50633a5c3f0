Senate President Ahmad Lawan on Tuesday described as a painful loss the death of Mallam Isma’ila Isa Funtua. Lawan expressed his heartfelt condolences to the family of the late business mogul, community leader, social and political activist and nationalist. “The news of the death of Mallam Isa Funtua left me with profound sadness,” Lawan said in a statement by his Special Adviser (Media), Ola Awoniyi, in Abuja. “He was a man who touched many lives and impacted the development of Nigeria with his foresight, industry, enterprise, boundless enthusiasm, magnetism, friendliness and accommodating spirit. “Mallam Isa Funtua made friends across tribe, religion, generation and class in Nigeria, and touched many lives in public service as well as in his private life,” he added. He described the departed as a man of many parts who brought to bear his great intelligence, energy and integrity on everything thing that he did. Lawan said Funtua was a pioneer and trail blazer who established an authoritative national newspaper and a giant construction company through which he left indelible footprints on the physical and sociology-political landscapes of Nigeria. “Even in death, Mallam Isa Funtua’s presence will continue to be felt for a long time by Nigerians,” Lawan said. The Senate President commiserated with the Government and People of Katsina State over the loss. Lawan also particularly condoled with President Muhammadu Buhari, who lost a close friend, trusted ally and in-law. Lawan prayed Allah to comfort the loved ones that Mallam Isa Funtua left behind, forgive his sins and accept his soul in Aljannat Firdaus.
