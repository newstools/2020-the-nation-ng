A COVID-19 task force has reportedly disrupted the burial of a 65-year-old woman in Eziowelle, Idemili North, Anambra State, incurring the wrath of the community youths. The youths were said to be incensed after learning that the task force had allegedly collected N90,000 for the burial. It took police intervention to stop a bloody clash with the armed task force personnel, it was gathered. Chairman of the youths, Chief Ugochukwu Asikwo said they reacted because they were pushed to the wall. “They claimed they were after security and development levies but there is no such thing in our community because we have since rejected administrators of our community as a result of the atrocities they have been committing,” he said. Police spokesman, Mohammed Haruna, said the Commissioner, John Abang has ordered a clampdown on such illegal activities.
