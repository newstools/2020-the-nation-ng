Wilfred Ndidi was in action as they reignited their hopes for a Champions League place with a home win against Sheffield United, who themselves missed the chance to go into sixth. The Super Eagles hard-tackling midfielder played the entire 90 minutes in The Foxes’2-0 win against The Blades  at the Kings Power Stadium while compatriot Kelechi Iheanacho was an unused substitute.  Brendan Rodgers’ men needed a positive reaction after a disastrous second-half collapse against Bournemouth on Sunday and looked much improved from the get-go, with Ayoze Perez turning home from teenage debutant Luke Thomas’ cross in the 29tth  minute. Blades goalkeeper Dean Henderson made a string of second-half saves but was unable to keep out substitute Demarai Gray, who hit a low effort home on the 79th  minute to see Leicester pull three points clear of Manchester United in fifth ahead of their game against Crystal Palace later on.
