Seven of the 12 elected councillors in Oredo Local Government, including that of Governor Godwin Obaseki’s Ward Four, have declared support for the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu. They promised to help him win the September 19 election. The councillors: Collins Eweka of Ward 12, Smart Ehioze of Ward Three, Geofrrey Enabulele of Ward Eight, Bright Aisien of Ward Four, Omoregbe Samuel of Ward Seven, Efosa Ogiame of Ward 11 and Reliance Okugbowa of Ward Nine met Ize-Iyamu and other APC leaders at the governorship candidate’s home in Benin. Speaking at the meeting, the councillor of Obaseki’s Ward Four said his loyalty and that of others in Oredo Council remained with the APC, adding that they would ensure Ize-Iyamu’s victory on September 19. The other councillors attested to Ize-Iyamu’s accessibility and leadership ability to bring the government closer to the people, as opposed to the victimisation and vendetta occurring in the state.
