Ogun State Government said on Sunday that it would pull down houses and structures obstructing waterways, causing flood. Environment Commissioner Abiodun Abudu-Balogun, who spoke while inspecting  areas affected by flood in Abeokuta, urged residents living along river courses to move to safer locations or be ejected. The Nation reported that a  downpour last Saturday left homes, business premises and roads in Abeokuta flooded, with property worth millions of naira destroyed or washed away. Flood prone areas mostly hit in Abeokuta  include Kuto, Isale-Igbein, Lanfewa, Amolaso, Ijeun-Titun, Ago-Ijesa, Abiola Way, Isale Abetu, Sokori, Igbore, Oke-Mosan, Isale Ake,  Adigbe and Isabo. Abudu-Balogun blamed the flooding on human activities such as indiscriminate dumping of refuse on waterways. The commissioner was accompanied by his counterpart in the Ministry of Physical Planning and Urban Development, Tunji Odunlami.
