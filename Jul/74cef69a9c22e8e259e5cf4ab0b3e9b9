He said there would be no prayers at Eid grounds, adding that area/ward mosques where Eid prayers would be observed should not have more than 50 worshippers in line with the government’s directives on COVID-19 protocol, or not more than 40 per cent of the mosque capacity. Ogaba appealed to Muslims to ensure blissful and peaceful Sallah through obedience to the laws and adherence to the COVID-19 protocols by maintaining physical distancing, using hand sanitisers and wearing face masks.
