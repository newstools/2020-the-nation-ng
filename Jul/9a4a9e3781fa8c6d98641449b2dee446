Everything is being put in place to give late Ibadan-born business mogul, Chief Bode Akindele, a deserving burial ceremony. To achieve this, a committee has been set up by the family and it is headed by the Ekefa Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oloye Lekan Alabi. Since the Baba Ijo, Methodist Church, Agbeni, Ibadan, died on Monday, 29th June, 2020, at age 87, tributes have continued to pour in. Social Circuit learnt that a meeting was held recently to brainstorm on how to give the late billionaire a decent burial and reception. While there is a strong desire to hold an elaborate burial, it was gathered that the current COVID-19-induced restrictions in the country have given the committee members a major headache. Presently, the committee is yet to arrive at a conclusion but there are strong indications that a modest burial may be adopted for Akindele due to the social distancing rule. “Yesterday (July 10, 2020) was our maiden meeting. So, we are going to have another meeting very soon, and the mandate to the committee is that, whatever we are going to do, however modest, must be cleared with the Bode Akindele family. But by the grace of God, we’ll try our best to meet the standard with which Sir Bode Akindele was known for all over the world. He was a man of 100% etiquette – everything must be in place,” a committee member stated.
