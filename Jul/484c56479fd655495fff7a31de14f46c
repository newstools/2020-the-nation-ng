 SUPER Eagles duo of Wilfred Ndidi and Kelechi Iheanacho hope of playing in the UEFA Champions League next year came to an end on Sunday  following Leicester City 2-0 home  loss to Manchester United on the final day of the Premier League season. Brendan Rodgers unleashed Ndidi and Iheanacho in the starting line up in a last minute attempt to push for a top-four finish but their performances at King Power Stadium yesterday was not enough to guarantee a spot in the Champions League. Ndidi was in action for the whole duration while Iheanacho played for 58th minute before he was substituted for Ayoze Perez. The Foxes created chances, Nemanja Matic gifting them an early one when he presented the ball to Iheanacho and the striker teed up Ndidi to drill just over from 20 yards. Iheanacho continued to find space and scuffed a shot which David De Gea spilled after 25 minutes with United vulnerable to the Foxes’ quick breaks. Leicester City maintained a top-four spot before the break due to the Corona Virus pandemic but the Foxes dropped in form on the return to football action which caused them the top European football game next season. The Nigeria internationals will play in the Europa league next season after finishing in the fifth spot with 62 points. A penalty from Bruno Fernandes in the second-half got United going before Jonny Evans was dismissed. Lingard then sealed the points with virtually the last kick of the match – after Kasper Schmeichel’s howler – to secure third place and re-joined Europe’s elite after a one-year absence. Elsewhere, after a nervy start at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea ensured victory over Wolves with a quick-fire double late in the first half to  ensure their spot in the Champions League next season.
