 OVER 16 vessels have departed Onne Port with 950,000 metric tons of liquefied natural gas (LNG) valued at N354billion in the last few months to various destinations. It was gathered that the Sines Port in Portugal alone took delivery of 141,000 cubic meters of the product. It is the first batch of the 2020 exports by Nigeria as gas demand is on the increase in the ports of Spain, China, Portugal and Turkey. The country is also the fourth largest producer of LNG in the world. To further boost export of the cargo this year, the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas Limited (NLNG) has appointed one of  Japan’s leading banks and the core unit of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group – Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC) and Guaranty Trust Bank Plc, as financial advisers, for Train 7 project estimated at between  $10 billion and $12 billion.
