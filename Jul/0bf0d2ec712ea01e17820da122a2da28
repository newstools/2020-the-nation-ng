Edo North Senatorial District’s political leaders met on Sunday in Auchi and described Governor Godwin Obaseki of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as a man of integrity. They said he is a principled politician. The leaders met under the aegis of Obaseki-Shaibu Movement (OSM). The political leaders, through their Chairman, Damian Lawani, urged the people in Edo South and Edo North senatorial districts to consider the future of the state and resist any arrangement that would prevent Obaseki’s re-election. They said: “Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, former national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), who is an ex-governor of Edo State, said many terrible things about Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu (APC’s governorship candidate). These are accepted messages and we are going to work with the messages. Those messages are damaging. They will determine the governorship election. The people are going to vote in line with those messages. “Edo State is known for performance. Edo State is known for using personality to determine the vote. Pastor Ize-Iyamu and his co-travellers are not strangers to us. They are people we know very well. We have been together. We contested before and we defeated them on the basis of the quality of the person. “The quality of Edo governor is known to people of the state. In terms of performance, keeping money in safe hands, managing the meagre resources and developing Edo State, Obaseki has done well in all sectors. “The September 19 election is a done deal. We are not jittery. We are ready for the governorship election. Edo people are vast politically. They are very knowledgeable in the ingredients that make up a better candidate for election.” The leaders described Obaseki as a good leader and a competent administrator.
