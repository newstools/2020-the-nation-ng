The fashion world is witnessing the resurgence of stretchy and curvy Bermuda shorts. There are varieties of these shorts in terms of length and fabric, but the stretchy and curvy ones are in vogue. The designs are sexy, classy and stylish. The shorts are usually above the knees and are getting crazier in shapes, length, designs and styles. Most are plain, some are beautifully-crafted with delicate embroidery and  while others are designed with exotic stones and sequins. They are everywhere this season and add that sex appeal to one’s look. Bermuda shorts are easy to walk in and comfortable; and they have taken over from three-quarter short and bum short, which were the most popular until now. A short is guaranteed to make you look sexy. But it’s not for the faint-hearted!. Never step out in one, without trying it out very well and making sure you are comfortable in it at home. Or better still, rock it with a big tee shirt or blouse. Now that you know how to rock it, go for it!
