The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has mourned the passing of former Speaker of the Edo State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Zakawanu Garuba. In a statement, the governor said the former Speaker’s passing is “a deep personal loss to him.” According to him, “I received the news of the passing of Rt. Hon. Zakawanu Garuba with a heavy heart. He was an outstanding Nigerian and a good man. He worked for the good of the people and contributed his quota to the development of his immediate community and the state. “As Executive Commissioner, Corporate Services & Supervising Executive Commissioner, Operations at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Nigeria, late Garuba performed brilliantly, distinguishing himself as a true Edo son with his commitment to duty, innovativeness and sheer dexterity. “As a politician and Speaker of the Edo State House of Assembly, he performed his tasks diligently, served the people meritoriously and provided sterling leadership to the legislative arm of government. “He excelled in his private practice as a constitutional lawyer, bringing panache to the noble profession. “The former speaker was indeed an astute politician and his wise counsel will be greatly missed. We pray that God grants his family the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss,” he added. Rt. Hon. Garuba was elected into the Edo State House of Assembly in 2003, on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). While in the House, he served as chairman of the House committee on judiciary, human rights, and legal matters. He became Speaker in 2007.
