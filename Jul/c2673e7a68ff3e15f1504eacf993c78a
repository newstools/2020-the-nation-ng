 THERE were fears on Sunday that leader of Borno State hunters and partner of the military in the fight against Boko Haram in the state, Abdulkareem Umar, aka Baba Maigiwa, may have been abducted by the insurgents. Local sources said Baba Maigiwa was possibly held hostage by a Boko Haram factional leader, Modu Sulum in what was described as a failed negotiation deal. Baba Maigiwa is the leader of hundreds of hunters that were recruited last year by the state government to compliment the efforts of the military in the fight against Boko Haram in the state. He helped Bauchi State, in 2009, under then governor Isa Yuguda to curb Boko Haram activities in the state. In Borno State, Baba Maigiwa is believed to be in charge of over 5,000 hunters and vigilantes launching offensive on the insurgents alongside the military. No official statement has been released on the missing chief hunter.
