 THE Lagos State chapter of the Young President Organisation (YPO), has announced plans to donate world-class medical equipment to the government. The donation comes just as the Eti-Osa COVID-19 isolation centre located at Landmark Village in the Victoria Island, Lagos State, will be closed on July 31, after three months of operations. YPO collaborated with the Lagos State government in setting up the 86-bed emergency treatment and isolation centre in Eti-Osa and handed over the facility to the government on 22 April for it to be integrated into the state-wide response for the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the planned closure of the centre in agreement with the state government at the end of the month, the organisation explained that it will continue its contributions towards improving the healthcare sector in the state. “The Eti-Osa Isolation Center’s sole purpose was to improve the capacity of the state to fight COVID-19 and thus save lives during the critical early stage of the pandemic. The 86-bed emergency treatment and isolation centre in Eti-Osa catered for moderately to severely sick patients, with an Intensive Care Unit (ICU), High dependency Unit (HDU) and a general ward. The centre is equipped with six ventilators, monitors, respirators, mobile X-ray, ultrasound and oxygen piping as well as all other auxiliary medical and non-medical facilities.
