The Lagos State Government has urged intending pilgrims to defer the exercise till 2021. This was part of the major resolutions reached between the state government, the intending Pilgrims, Ulamahs (Islamic scholars) and other stakeholders, during a one-day sensitisation programme at the Lagos State Secretariat, Alausa, Ikeja. The decision was in reaction to the cancellation of pilgrims outside Saudi Arabia for this yearâ€™s hajj. Commissioner for Home Affairs Prince Anofiu Elegushi hailed Saudi authority for taking such a bold and difficult decision in order to curb the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19). As a government that is responsible to its people, he said no pilgrim would be denied legitimate right to seek refund of the hajj fare already paid. He, however, advised them to allow the funds remain in government cover till next year when they would be priority over others. He urged those who are yet to complete their payment to do so to secure their place in the record of the Muslim Pilgrims Welfare Board. Narrating the efforts already put in place by the state government before the pandemic struck, Elegushi said that he led some officials to Saudi Arabia to secure a befitting accommodation for the pilgrims.
