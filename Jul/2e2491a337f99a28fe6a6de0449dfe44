The Federation Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC) has shared a total of ₦651.184 billion as June 2020 Federation Account Revenue to Federal, States and Local Governments Councils and relevant agencies in the country. However it is unclear where the government got money to augment revenue shared for the month. In April, 2020 Minister of Finance Budget and National Planning Zainab Ahmed announced the government will approach the Nigeria Sovereign Investments Authority (NSIA) for $150 million to make for the expected shortfall in revenue as a result of coronavirus pandemic. When contacted, Managing Director of the NSIA Mr. Uche Orji, told The Nation: “We have not received a formal request. The funds are now in cash and ready for disbursement once we get the request we will release the money. “The way we run the stabilisation fund is that once we get the request, we will release the money to government within seven days. Our own is to get the money ready.” Attempts to find out from the Ministry of Finance why the government has not accessed the $150 million from NSIA proved abortive as officials failed to respond to enquiries. Director, Information, Press and Public Relations, Henshaw Ogbuike, who released the communiqué, said the FAAC meeting to share June 2020 was held on Friday.
