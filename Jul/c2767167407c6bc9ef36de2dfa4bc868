 Super Eagles’  winger Samuel Chukwueze would expectedly  be in  the Villarreal’s starting line-up in today’s La Liga tie when the Yellow Submarines  take on Getafe in the battle for UEFA Champions League spot. Chukwueze was in action when Villarreal suffered their first defeat since  the return of  the La Liga following the COVID-19 lockdown in the 4-1 home defeat against Barcelona at the weekend and will be aiming to for  winning ways with his team. Both  Getafe and Villarreal will take the battle to Coliseum Alfonso Perez as one point separates the Champions-League-chasing sides in the La Liga table. However, both teams head into this potentially-crucial contest having failed to record maximum points over the weekend, allowing Sevilla to extend their advantage in fourth position. Despite spending time in contention for the top six, both Getafe and Villarreal lost significant ground on Sevilla last weekend ahead of a potentially-pivotal showdown tonight. At a time when Sevilla defeated Leganes by a 3-0 score line, significantly improving their goal difference, Getafe was held by Osasuna and Villarreal were thrashed by Barcelona.
