 A community development group, Iro Progressive Union (IPU), has donated palliative items worth several thousands of naira to Iro-Ekiti, Gbonyin Local Government Area of Ekiti State. Presenting the items to the traditional ruler of the community, Oba Felix Adeniyi Afolabi, on behalf of the group’s President, Chief Stephen Omolale, the Chairman of the Special Covid-19 Palliatives Committee, Deacon Dele Ogunsemoyin, said the fund with which the items were procured was contributed by the sons and daughters of the community both at home and in the Diaspora and some of their friends. Items donated were bags of rice, beans, semovita, salt and others. Ogunsemoyin said IPU, which is the umbrella organisation for all the indigenes of the community, was touched by the disruption of the sources of livelihood of the townsfolk due to the debilitating effects of Covid-19 and “we felt the only way we could help our people is to come together and do something for them, no matter how small.”  The chairman, who was accompanied by Wale Obadoye and Mrs. Oluwakemi Daramola, hailed those who made the project a reality and pledged that the union would do more to help the people. Oba Afolabi thanked the union for the gesture and prayed for God’s blessings and protection for members of the group at home and in the Diaspora. He appealed for unity among the indigenes of the community, saying this remained the quickest way to greater development. The ceremony was witnessed by many people in the community, including religious leaders, who took turns to pray for the donors.
