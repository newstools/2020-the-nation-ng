Leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have received more defectors from the All Progressives Congress (APC) and other parties. The Publicity Secretary, Chris Nehikhare, made the disclosure yesterday in an online statement. He said: “PDP leaders in Edo State have held more sensitisation and strategic meetings. They have welcomed more defectors from the APC and other parties in the 192 wards and 18 local governments. “At Ekperi wards 6, 7 and 8 of Etsako Central Local Government, over 1,000 people attended the meeting. Addressing the crowd, the Edo North Senatorial Coordinator for PDP Campaign Council, Mr. Pascal Ugbome, spoke about the sterling qualities of Governor Godwin Obaseki. “Ugbome also spoke about the need to support Governor Obaseki, while receiving favourable responses and commitments from the attendees. They resolved that Ekperi was satisfied with Governor Obaseki and promised to deliver over 80 per cent of the registered voters to PDP. They disclosed that only a few APC members were left at Ekperi.”
