Days after police in Ogun State arrested a pastor, Oluwafemi Oyebola, who allegedly impregnated his daughter three times and procured a family planning procedure to stop further conceptions, the nurse who helped out with the procedures has also been apprehended. Nurse Ogundimu Monilola said she is Assistant Chief Matron at the State General Hospital, Idiroko, as well as being in charge of family planning services at the facility, but denied carrying out any abortion on Pastor Oyebolaâ€™s daughter. Police, however, said she had, in an earlier statement, admitted performing abortions on the lady. She said she was on duty when the man presented the girl for family planning at the hospital, claiming the girl was his househelp. She said she never knew the family planning sought was targeted at shielding the incestuous lifestyle of her father, Pastor Oyebola.
