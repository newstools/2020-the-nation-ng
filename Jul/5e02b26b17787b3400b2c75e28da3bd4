The National Youth leadership caucus of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has endorsed the second term aspiration of Ondo Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu. It is a body comprising of all the party’s zonal youth leaders, the National Youth leader, the Deputy National Youth leader, and all state youth leaders of the APC. The APC youths endorsed Akeredolu after embarking on two- day tour of projects executed by the Governor in his first term. They said they were impressed with the performances of Akeredolu. Projects visited included the Oke-Alabojuto road, Olusegun Agagu University of Science and Technology, Okitipupa, Ondo-Linyi Industrial hub at Omotosho, Redemption bridge at Ore amongst others. Addressing journalists in Akure, Deputy National Youth Leader of the APC, Hon Afeez Bolaji Repete, said a visit to the project sites would convince every lover of progress that Akeredolu should be supported to complete all he started. Repete said it was the kind heart and commitment of Akeredolu that brought life back to the Olusegun Agagu University of Science and Technology, Okitipupa, in terms of needed infrastructures. According to him: “We saw, and used the Redemption bridge at Ore, and we are very grateful for the initiative. “There is no Nigerian who will not appreciate Governor Akeredolu for that bridge, as it is life saving and economically impactful. “If the essence of governance is the overall development of the society, and lifting the burden of the people, Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has indeed done well. “He has done the All Progressives Congress proud. We have seen his vision, we align with it and we as members of the national executives of the party put all our weight and influence in the party behind him as we go into the primary elections. “We stand for a better Nigeria, a better Ondo State and to such; we declare total support for the reelection of Arakunrin Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, to continue as governor of Ondo state for another four years.”
