 THE Nigeria Railway Corporation (NRC) has declared its facilities and environs a no-mask no-entry zone in preparation for the resumption of operations on Wednesday. Manager, Abuja-Kaduna Train Service Mr. Pascal Nnorli told reporters that the corporation has put measures in place to ensure passengers obeyed COVID-19 guidelines on the trains. “We are 85 per cent ready because we know a day like that will come. “If you pass through our station at Idu today, you will see a demo of what we intend to do in all the stations. “You can see the social distancing marked at strategic locations. Now, we have a definite date for resumption; we will complete them in all the passenger stations. “And again, we have declared all railway environment and facilities no mask – no entry environment,” Nnorli added. The Nigerian Union of Railway Workers (NUR) has called also on NRC to put safety and preventive protocols in proper perspective before bringing the trains back on track. The union, in a statement issued by the NUR Secretary-General, Comrade Segun Esan, noted that safety of workers and passengers is paramount. He added that the union will not be favourably disposed to whatever situations that will in any way undermine the health of workers and passengers.
