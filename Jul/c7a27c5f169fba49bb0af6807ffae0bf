Leicester City manager Brendan Rodgers has slammed striker Kelechi Iheanacho for his below performance  after  the Foxes were out-foxed in Sunday’s 4-1 thrashing by Bournemouth even as he ruled the substitution of the Nigerian  as tactical error. Iheanacho, who had been heavily involved in Jamie Vardy’s opener, was withdrawn at half-time at the Vitality Stadium, with Rodgers tweaking his system to bring on Dennis Praet. “(Iheanacho) wasn’t having one of his better games,” said Rodgers in his post-match press conference. “The issue for us defensively was on the side of the pitch, because there was a lot of space for Wilf and Youri to cover.” “So we pushed Ayo on, he was playing well, and added an extra midfielder in to help cover; but the defeat wasn’t tactical, it was about the spirit.” He added: “I didn’t see it (the defeat) coming. We didn’t have personality in the second half. Rodgers however c charged his wards to rise to the challenge when they take on Sheffield United on Thursday.
