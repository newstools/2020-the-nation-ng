 EKITI State Traffic Management Agency (EKSTMA) yesterday arrested over 100 motorists for not wearing facemasks as part of the guidelines to combat the spread of COVID-19. This is coming as Kwara State Technical Committee on COVID-19 yesterday said that from July 31, residents not wearing facemasks will be arrested and prosecuted. Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice Wale Fapohunda had on Friday announced that commuters and commercial motorcycle riders and other citizens, who refuse to put on the mask or carry any violator from yesterday, will be arrested and prosecuted. Starting the enforcement for motorists yesterday, the General Manager, EKSTMA, Femi Olanrewaju, who led the traffic agencyâ€™s operatives during the operation, said over 100 offenders were arrested in the first day of the enforcement.  Olanrewaju revealed that though, the offenders were supposed to be prosecuted in line with the laid down rules, but were pardoned owing to the respect Governor Kayode Fayemi has for the people. Kwara State Technical Committee on COVID-19 said residents must use face masks in public places, keep physical distancing or stay indoors beginning from Friday July 24. It attributed the spike in cases of COVID-19 largely to people not adhering to safety protocols. Chief Press Secretary to the Governor and spokesman of the committee Rafiu Ajakaye told reporters in Ilorin, the state capital, adding that the government is disturbed by the rising cases in the state and would spare no effort to flatten the curve and protect the people.
