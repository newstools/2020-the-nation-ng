  The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC)  has elected the first black female to its Executive Board. At its recently-held virtual  World Council Meeting, the Information Technology practitioner and founder of West Blue Consulting, Ms. Valentina Mintah, was elected into the Board.  She also serves as Vice Chair of ICC Ghana Speaking about her election, Mintah  said: “Despite the current global health and economic crisis, Africa cannot and should not be overwhelmed. It is, therefore, vital that intra-African trade is strengthened in line with the goal of the Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA). Therefore, leveraging the growth opportunities for sustainable intra-African trade is an objective that should be supported for the benefit of the African economy. ‘’In addition, focus should be on ways to empower and support small business owners to survive and thrive in the era of covid-19 and beyond, using digital technology and innovative business practices.” ICC Secretary General, John Denton said: “ICC is delighted to welcome Valentina Mintah to its global Executive Board. Throughout her career, Valentina has championed international trade facilitation both in her home region of West Africa and in a number of transitional economies across the world. With her additional role as Vice Chair of ICC Ghana, she is uniquely placed to promote the strengthening of commercial and trade ties within high growth global markets. ICC is the institutional representative of more than 45 million companies in over 130 countries across the world.
