Adekunle Yusuf As businesses continue to grapple with numerous challenges during the coronavirus era, innovation seems to be the only thing that people need to remain in business. To this end, in order to cater to the surging demand for telemedicine services in Nigeria, MeCure Smart, a smartphone app that allows remote online consultations, has partnered with HelloDocApp, the largest online community of doctors in Nigeria, to bring more than 10,000 doctors on its platform. This is to cater for patients who now prefer remote consultations, since this allows both the doctors and patients a very safe and effective environment to manage healthcare in the pandemic time, said Ajinkya Shelar, product manager who heads MeCure Smart. “When we launched MeCure Smart back in April 2019, we were simply conducting an experiment: Is the Nigerian market ready for healthcare services through a digital platform. Cut to February 2020 and we were not able to handle the sheer volume of calls anymore. The scale and demand for tele-medicine services is overwhelming today. “Hence, we decided to tie up with HelloDoc. This partnership will allow us to onboard 4000+ doctors across every specialty ranging from general physicians to even neurosurgeons on our MeCure Smart app immediately and we intend to further expand it to up to 10,000+ doctors by end of 2020. We hope that through this initiative anyone in Nigeria will immediately have access to quality and affordable healthcare that is also COVID safe,” Shelar added. He further explained the MeCure Smart – HelloDoc partnership works as a pure marketplace. This, he said, means customers can browse doctors by specialty and compare them by prior customer feedback, ratings and even pricing, adding that each doctor on the platform has a verified Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria (MDCN) certificate and is vetted through a rigorous background check.
