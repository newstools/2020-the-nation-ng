Delta State Governor Ifeanyi Okowa has directed members of the state executive council and his appointees to embark on compulsory COVID-19 test as part of measures to contain the spread of the virus, it was learnt yesterday. The directive, which was contained in an internal memo, also affected civil servants working within the Government House and the office of the deputy governor, Kingsley Otuaro. It was learnt that several aides, including close security details to the governor, recently tested positive to the ravaging virus. The Nation gathered that the memo, which was at the instance of the governor,Â  is to ensure that the Government House is free of the virus. A source, which confirmed the development, said the various units, including media aides, have been directed to go for the test immediately. Many of the commissioners and political appointees are, however, uncomfortable with the development. Okowa, his wife Edith, daughter, Secretary to the State Government (SSG) Chiedu Ebie and the commissioner for information, Mr. Charles Anaigwu, have tested positive to the virus.
