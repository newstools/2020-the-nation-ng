 Three suspects being tried over illegal tax collection are still languishing in the Correctional Centre, 10 days after a Federal High Court sitting in Jos granted them bail. This is because the Police Command in Plateau State has declined to take them on bail as ordered by Justice Musa Kurya, the Presiding Judge. Justice Kurya had on July 20 granted bail to Sule Yaro, Adamu Ibrahim and Austin Obeh, after listening to the bail application raised by their counsel Samson Bukar. Justice Kurya had ordered the Police Prosecution Counsel, N.K. Tali and the Investigation Police Officer (IPO) One Wahav, to take the suspects on bail and adjourned the case to October 29 for hearing. But the Prosecution Counsel explained to reporters in Jos why the order had not been complied with. “The Nigeria Police Force (NPF) is a regimental institution and has no such right or power to take any suspect on bail in any court case.”  “The law is clear about this and we can’t go against the law simply because there is a court ruling. “Even the defence counsels know that fact, which explained why they quickly prepared a motion challenging the court ruling, but which couldn’t be heard before the court went on vacation on Friday, July 24.” Tali said: “As it stands, they have to be patient to remain in the Correctional Centre until October 12, when the case will come up again after the vacation.” The Nation reports that the suspects were arrested on Feb. 20 along Maraba Jama’a – Abuja Road where they had allegedly mounted illegal checkpoints and collecting illegal revenue of farm produce and livestock. “They were extorting motorists under the guise of collecting tax on agricultural produce and livestock. But the accused pleaded not guilty when they were arraigned on a three-count charge before Justice Kurya.
