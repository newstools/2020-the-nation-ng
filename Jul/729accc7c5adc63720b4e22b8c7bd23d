Health workers at the isolation centre in Central Hospital, Warri, Delta State have threatened to down tools over alleged harassment by the management of hotels, where they are lodged. The health workers are miffed that the state government was reneging on the agreement reached with the hotels on their accommodation and feeding. Our reporter gathered that some health workers, including three doctors, two nurses and one health assistant, on Tuesday were held hostage at a popular hotel in Warri, owing to unpaid debts. It was learnt that the incident was the second of such event. Delta Commissioner for Health Dr. Mordi Ononye said he was unaware of the current situation, but stressed that the government has made payments to the hotels, where the caregivers are lodged. I am not aware of this situation. I know that the government makes payments to these hotels. I ask for patience as the state government will not renege on any commitment made,‚Äù Ononye said.
