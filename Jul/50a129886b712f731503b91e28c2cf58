 The Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN) is set to adopt online model for its examinations. Its Head, Corporate Communication and External Relations, Nelson Olagundoye, said the new mode, which will take off next April is in line with the objective of the institute to stay ahead of others. The Governing Council of the institute, has okayed the initiatiive. The CIBN official said students were expected to confirm their identity and location which will be monitored via a live webcam/video proctored software throughout the examination. He explained that the proctored examination will ensure the identity of the candidates, flag any irregular behaviour, scan and ensure the integrity of examineeâ€™s environments as well as detect any instances of fraud or suspected violation(s) of the rules by the candidates. Olagundoye also said the move was a response to the pandemic which has disrupted the examinations of professional bodies. In 2018, the institute was the first professional body in Nigeria to migrate its examinations to Computer-Based Testing (CBT) platform.
