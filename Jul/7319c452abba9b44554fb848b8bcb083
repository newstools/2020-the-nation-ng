All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ekiti State has set up a 10-man panel to reconcile warring factions. The committee, constituted in Ado-Ekiti by the Paul Omotosho-led State Working Committee (SWC), is chaired by former party Chairman Jide Awe. Biodun Akin-Fasae, ex-Special Adviser to Governor Kayode Fayemi, is secretary. Other members are Mrs. Ronke Okusanya; Abiodun Ajayi; Tunde Fakoyede; Tayo Ekundayo; Niyi Olajide and Teslim Animasahun. The ruling party has been split into two factions – one led by Fayemi and the other by Presidential Adviser on Political Matters Senator Babafemi Ojudu. Omotosho said the panel was necessary as the party had been embroiled in crises. He said: “The move to reconcile aggrieved members started about a year ago. The executive arm of the party has started visiting perceived aggrieved members at various levels, but the Coronavirus pandemic served as a clog in the wheel. “We inaugurated this committee to put our house in order and lay all misunderstanding to rest. We are one and there shouldn’t be any reason why we can’t settle our differences using internal mechanism.”
