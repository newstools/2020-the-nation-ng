The remains of the leader of the dreaded One Million Boys gang, Biola (aka Ebila), were buried in Ibadan on Monday even as police refused to reveal his killers. Ebila was shot dead on Sunday in the capital city. Some men believed to be members of his gang took his body to Idi Aro police station in a tricycle. Two of them were arrested by police. While sources said he was shot dead by security agents while trying to collect ransom from relatives of a man he kidnapped, police said they were yet to get details of who killed him and in what circumstances. The operation of the security agents were said to be unofficial. A source said the kidnap victim had made arrangements with his relatives to deliver N1 million ransom to Ebila and his gang but that the security agents identified the location where they were hiding. On getting to the location, Ebila’s boys were said to have opened fire on the security agents who returned fire.  Ebila was shot during the crossfire, leading to his death. His killing by security agents might be the reason his suspected gang members took his body to the police station. He was buried in the Kudeti area of the city on Monday. Police spokesman Olugbenga Fadeyi insisted that he had no details of those who killed Ebila.
