 Lagos State Commissioner for Home Affairs Prince Anofiu  Elegushi has appealed to the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON) to give states’ Muslim Pilgrims Welfare Boards the right to generate revenue internally. This, he said, was to have enough funds to execute the hajj operation in their states. Elegushi made the appeal during an inspection visit by the NAHCON’s Chairman/Chief Executive Officer, Alhaji Zikrullahi Kunle Hassan, to the Hajj Camp in Akowonjo, Alimosho Local Government Area of Lagos State. The commissioner said there was need to reduce the financial burden on state governments, adding that by reducing the huge expenses usually incurred by the states during hajj operation, the state governments would be able to channel the funds to other equally important projects that would be beneficial to the generality of the people. He advised NAHCON to commercialise the multi-purpose hall at the camp. NAHCON chief Alhaji Zikrullah Hassan sought the assistance of the state government for the completion of the Akowonjo-Alimosho Hajj Camp, saying the camp has remained in its current state due to lack of funds.
