 CHAIRMAN of the All Progressives Congress Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary National Convention Planning Committee, Mai Mala Buni, is fast realising that the task ahead of him may be very difficult for him to actualize unless he promptly takes some bold steps. Sentry gathered at the weekend that the Yobe State governor has given a directive that the constant presence of a certain group at the national secretariat should be discouraged immediately. Apparently, the chairman feels the presence of these APC chieftains who are not members of the Caretaker Committee whenever he goes out in his capacity as temporary party chair, may become counterproductive. He is said to have decided to reduce the visibility of such people. According to party sources, tongues have been wagging of late that the chairman may be under the influence of certain people, especially some governors elected on the platform of the party. Perhaps determined to present his leadership as a neutral one that is ready to provide a level playing ground for all shades of interests within the party, Buni may finally be taking the bull by the horns.
