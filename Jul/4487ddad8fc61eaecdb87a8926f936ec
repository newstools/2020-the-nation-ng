 The Registrar General Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) Garba Abubakar at the weekend stated the commission has begun the use of courier services for delivery of certificates to customers. Garba disclosed this during a media briefing in Abuja. He insisted the mailing system will replace physical presence with customers. According to him: “The government guidelines have urged all to comply with the rules by adhering to restrictions. “Presently, CAC system is not fully electronic so there is need to decongest by using the mailing courier.  “We have introduced a mailing system where customers submit their documents through courier services and receive it through the same services. “This system was introduced a week ago and so far 400 customers have collected their certificates. “For applications done online, they will be replied online. If it is physical, parcel your documents give to the courier services, it will be worked on and mailed back to you.” He revealed since May 29, all certificates issued by CAC have Tax Identification Number (TIN). “From the 10th of August 2020, there will be no need for customers to submit original documents. “The era of carrying documents to CAC is over, they cannot be allowed in except by appointment,” he stressed.
