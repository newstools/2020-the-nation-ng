 THE 2020 FA Cup Final will be an all-London affair after Chelsea beat Manchester United to set up a showpiece derby against Arsenal on August 1. Having watched Arsenal knock holders Manchester City out of the competition on Saturday, Frank Lampard’s Chelsea saw off Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s United 3-1 on Sunday. The results mean the FA Cup trophy will be returning to London, with Chelsea (2018 winners) and Arsenal (2017 winners) facing off in a repeat of the 2017 final. It also means that either Frank Lampard or Mikel Arteta will win a trophy in their debut season as managers of either club. On Saturday, Pep Guardiola’s City were heavy favourites to win this semi-final and reach yet another final – but they squandered both possession and chances as Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang struck in either half to secure a 2-0 win for the Gunners. As for Chelsea, they took advantage of two errors from David de Gea as goals from Olivier Giroud and Mason Mount’s efforts sealed a spot in the final. The record winners of this competition, Arsenal will now be looking to lift the FA cup for a 14th time.
