 GUNMEN have kidnapped a traditional ruler in Nasarawa State, Alhaji Mohammed Dankawo. Our correspondent gathered that Dankawo, the Ardo Udege in the Udege Local Council Development Area of the state, was abducted from his residence. The kidnappers demanded N7m ransom. But Commissioner of Police Bola Longe said Dankawo is an informant to kidnappers, adding, “We are looking for him to arrest him. We have arrested him before for giving kidnappers information.” The Nasarawa State chair of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria, Alhaji Mohammed Hussaini, told our correspondent of the traditional ruler’s abduction. “Ardo Udege, Alhaji Mohammed Dankawo, has been kidnapped and still in the custody of his abductors,” he said. “The kidnappers are demanding N7m.”
