Ekiti Governor Dr. Kayode Fayemi has declared he is okay with no adverse effects or symptoms despite contracting coronavirus on Wednesday. In a viral video circulated on Facebook, WhatsApp, Youtube and other social media platforms on Thursday, Fayemi said he would soon resume to serve the people. He stated COVID-19 was not a hoax, urging the public to adhere to the established protocols. While expressing optimism he would come out of isolation hale and hearty, Fayemi applauded Nigerians for their outpouring of love, concerns and prayers since he tested positive. Fayemi said: “This morning, I shared on my twitter handle about my COVID 19 results which came out positive. I have decided to do this for the generality of Ekiti people and to reassure everyone that I am Okay. “I have basically kept myself, which is the protocol but only to see my doctor. I want to tell our people that Covid 19 is real. “If there are people out there who think there is nothing like that, it is real. “So, it is important you wear your face masks, wash your hands regularly and maintain social distancing at every opportunity and keep to yourself, that is the least we could do. “We could only care, it is God who heals. I thank our people for their solidarity and effusive messages of prayers I have received across Ekiti, Nigeria and even from outside Nigeria. “Everybody has extended their prayers to me and I believe by the grace of God I shall come out of this healthy and physically back on duty to services to our people. Thank you.”
