 The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ondo State has told protesting governorship aspirants that they cannot dictate mode of primary to the party. Some APC members supporting about 10 aspirants at the weekend protested in Akure demanding for direct mode of primary for the July 20 primary of the party. But the Ondo APC said it was inconceivable that aspirants would dictate to the party on which mode to adopt. State Publicity Secretary of the party, Alex Kalejaiye, in a press statement said the party was disturbed at inflammatory statements credited to some of the aspirants, especially those laden with threats, to “ensure that the State chapter is brought down”, where the wish was not granted. The statement said any committed party member would would prefer to work assiduously towards the victory of the party at any election. According to the statement, “It is imperative for aspirants, like students preparing for examination, to abide by the rules and guidelines from the national secretariat, so long these rules are not at variance with the contents of the party constitution. “The efforts to set a terrible precedent for the party, by allowing aspirants to dictate what mode to adopt for an election, should be invested in quality and decent campaigns to sell their candidacy to party elders, leaders and members. These groups will definitely speak, directly or through the party structures. “The State secretariat’s concern is to promote all genuine efforts, geared towards a rancour-free primary election; produce a candidate, who will ultimately retain the State for the party, come October.”
