The Ekiti chapter of the All Progressives Congress has tackled its counterpart, the People’s Democratic Party for launching vitrolic and unscathing remarks against the Governor Fayemi-led administration in the state. The ruling party said that the opposition PDP has turned itself to an object of ridicule following its alleged plot to destabilize the APC-led administration by resorting to calumny to score political points. In a statement in Ado-Ekiti yesterday by its Director of Publicity, Elder Sam Oluwalana, APC said the opposition party should bury its face in shame and apologise to the people of Ekiti for its alleged four years of misrule. The party said the PDP-led government lack the moral right to be upbraiding Fayemi who assiduously put things aright as a foot gap from the past administration. It alleged that the opposition party brought Ekiti to its knees with anti-people’s and life-threatening policies and viable indicators of socio-economic development were in the extreme negative mode. According to the statement, “Activities of the opposition People’s Democratic Party, (PDP) in Ekiti in recent times have shown that the party is dwindling and will soon go into oblivion. “It is not unusual for political party to be out of government as no condition is permanent, but when such a party now turns its period of interregnum to embark on things that may likely jeopardize the future of its members calls for concern. “Since the imposition of care taker committee on the PDP in the state, it has continued to move from grace to disgrace with the committee members rather than facing their assignment, are only interested in causing trouble in the state by dishing out lies of high magnitude to the general public.
