 STRUCTURES housing Boko Haram Commanders in Parisu and Bula Bello in Sambisa forest area of Borno State have been destroyed by airstrikes conducted by the Air Task Force of Operation Lafiya Dole, The Nation has learnt. According to a statement by the Coordinator Defence Media Operations, Major-General John Enenche, the fortified structures hidden under forest vegetation were a stronghold for Boko Haram commanders. The statement said, “The Air Task Force of Operation Lafiya Dole has destroyed the dwellings of Boko Haram Terrorists (BHTs) leaders and neutralised some of their fighters in separate air strikes conducted at Parisu and Bula Bello in the Sambisa Forest Area of Borno State. Enenche said the airstrikes took place “on 3 July 2020 as part of the ongoing subsidiary Operation Long Reach II after intelligence reports indicated a resurgence of terrorists’ activities in the two settlements. Parisu, with its booby-trapped access routes, fortified checkpoints and structures camouflaged under the forest vegetation, served as a stronghold for the BHT commanders, while recent aerial surveillance missions showed increased activities of the terrorists in a cluster of structures in the middle of Bula Bello. “Consequently, the Air Task Force dispatched its fighter jets to attack the two locations. The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) jets, while taking turns to engage the targets, scored accurate bomb and rocket strikes, resulting in the destruction of some of the structures as well as the killing of several terrorists.”
