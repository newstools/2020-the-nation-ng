We breathe the same air We live and die beneath the same sky We sing different anthems But our melodies rally to a common Song   COVID mocked the moon Re-ordered the calendar Tumbling budgets clash with truncated dreams Hours stagger into idle epochs   Vaulting vulnerabilities, dire disablements Griefâ€™s tight-textured face Stony syllables of the language of Pain Thunderous riot of hungry stomachs   Behold the murderous pandemic of toxic rulers The credulous crowd of fickle followers The terrible visibility of a Foe Unseen Gory epic of a plague foretold   But Noble Science to the rescue, (In its healing way, and most humane) Its boundless possibilities of Knowing That tamed the terror of the pox, then, polio   And so here we are Measuring distance by the speed of a droplet COVID re-draws the map of our world Even as sunrise lingers beyond its morbid darkness
