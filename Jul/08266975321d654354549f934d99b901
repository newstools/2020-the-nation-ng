English Premier League champions Liverpool are weighing up a late move for Victor Osimhen as Italian outfit Napoli  are reportedly ready to unveil the in-form striker. The 21-year-old Nigeria international has been in talks with Napoli over an estimated £80m move and is expected to be unveiled today by the San Paolo side in Rome having passed his medicals, but reports indicate that Liverpool chief Peter Moore is closely monitoring the situation. The Reds lifted the title on Wednesday following a dramatic 5-3 win over Chelsea and have already turned focus to next season with Jurgen Klopp keen to bolster his striking options as vultures circle around for his two main hit-men Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane. Lille are desperate to offload Osimhen as they look to bring in some much-needed income following the coronavirus pandemic. Osimhen scored 13 goals last season after being plucked from Belgium minnows Charleroi to replace Nicolas Pepe when he joined Arsenal. Osimhen, who has only been at Lille for one season, is also a rumoured target for Arsenal and Chelsea.
