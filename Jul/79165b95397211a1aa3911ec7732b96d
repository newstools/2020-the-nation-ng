Some 1,800 school children in Kaduna and Ogun states became the first in Nigeria to receive their “My Story of Water” worksheets on June10, courtesy of the Five Cowries Initiative (FCI). Across Nigeria, school children have been forced away from their classrooms as a result of coronavirus prevention measures. Five Cowries Initiative stepped in to address this educational limbo by developing ‘Home Learning Kits”, a creative way to keep school-age children motivated, occupied, and positive during the nationwide school closure. The worksheets, which require no access to electricity or data, are part of a fuller alternative education plan, keen on exploring the use of arts in nurturing creativity in education. They will be used in conjunction with other supporting activities such as a weekly 30-minute radio show incorporating lessons, storytelling, current affairs, and call-ins led teachers. In facilitating the journey of learning, the 1,800 children who receive initial worksheets will continue to receive subsequent worksheets–in line with the learning schedule, every two weeks over four months. While distribution is yet to begin in Lagos State, FCI has been developing creative programmes with the Ministry of Education and the Commissioner for Education, Mrs. Folasade Adefisayo is an active supporter of the “My Story of Water” project. With the distribution of 1500 worksheets set to begin across SOS villages this week, Five Cowries Initiative aims to replicate its current successes nationwide. To achieve this, it is working closely with technical and implementing partners including, Teach For Nigeria and SOS Children in developing the educational content and DHL in delivering the sheets across the nation. Committed to fostering the preservation of indigenous languages, the worksheets are currently available in Yoruba, Igbo and French will soon be translated into Hausa and Kanuri.
