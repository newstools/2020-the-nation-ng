 The Oniba Ruling House in Iba Local Council Development Area of Lagos state has appealed to the state government to respect the culture and tradition of the area in choosing the next king after the demise of their monarch. The former Oniba of Iba, Oba Yushau Goriola Oseni, died in March at 77. Prince Sam Ademola Shonibare, the surviving Head of the ruling family of Idomila Ruling House of Iba said the town has only one ruling house, made up of three branches. The branches, he said, are Shonibare, Oro Oton, Oseni families. According to him, the next King of Iba will have to come from one of the three branches. He said the procedure for selecting new monarch has been enshrined in Iba declaration of 1957 in accordance to Lagos Chieftaincy Laws. “The culture and tradition in Iba before the announcement of the death of their king is the declaration of three months and one day for mourning without any activities concerning installation of a new king… the successive plan to install the new monarch. Members of the families are meeting according to the custom to present a consensus selection to the people and to the kingmakers for coronation…” he said.
