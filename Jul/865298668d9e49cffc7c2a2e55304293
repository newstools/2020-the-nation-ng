 THE Management of University of Abuja said it has distributed over two thousand face masks and hand sanitisers to workers to protect the university community from COVID-19. The items were distributed to the staff through the University COVID -19 Committee, which the Vice-Chancellor, Prof Abdul-Rasheed Na’Allah, had set up in April 2020 to ensure that the university is free of the pandemic. The management also directed the full enforcement of ‘no mask no entry’ order and regular washing of hands by both workers and visitors to the university. In a statement by Head, Information and University Relations of the university, Dr. Habib Yakoob, the management stressed that henceforth no staff, student or visitor would be allowed into the campuses if they fail to comply with the directive. However, final year students in Abia State may be going back to school, as stakeholders in the state’s education sector are considering August 10, for reopening of schools to enable students in exit classes to prepare and write their relevant examinations. This was the outcome of a one-day summit at Michael Okpara Auditorium of Government House, Umuahia, where it was agreed that the planned school reopening is subject to verifiable compliance with all the proposed COVID-19 protocols, prevention and control measures. In his remarks at the summit, Governor Okezie Ikpeazu, who insisted that the state was desirous of ensuring that students resume classes as quickly as possible, maintained that his administration would not sacrifice the health of the children for anything.
