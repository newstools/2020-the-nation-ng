 THE political crisis rocking the Cross River State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) may soon come to an end if feelers are anything to go by. Insiders say after months of confrontation between Governor Ben Ayade’s political family and another group of PDP chieftains described as the ‘Abuja gang’, the governor is now making moves to bring peace to the party. He and the Abuja gang, made up of National Assembly members and other party chieftains opposed to Ayade, had been locked in a fierce political battle for control of the party following call for congresses in the state by the national leadership of PDP. The situation led to two separate lists of executives emanating from congresses conducted by the warring factions. After the congress, the national secretariat of approved the list of the Abuja gang as ward, local government, and executive committee members for the party in the state. Expectedly, the governor and his people rejected the directive and a couple of cases were promptly filed in court to stop the new executives from taking over the party. But all that may change soon as Sentry learnt Ayade is seeking an end to the stalemate and is ready for a power sharing deal that will bring peace back to the party. It was equally learnt the national chairman is open to the governor’s peace moves.
