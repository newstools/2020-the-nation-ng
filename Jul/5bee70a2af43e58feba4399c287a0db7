 THAT Eyitayo Jegede, former Commissioner for Justice and Attorney-General of Ondo State, has clinched the ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the October 10 governorship election, is stale news. What’s new is his fast improving relationship with former Governor Olusegun Mimiko and how that will affect his chances at the polls. Jegede served under Mimiko and also got his backing to emerge as the PDP candidate in the 2016 governorship election which he lost to incumbent governor Rotimi Akeredolu. According to insiders, after the loss the relationship between the two political allies became frosty, so much so that when Mimiko dumped the PDP and moved his political family into the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP), Jegede stayed back in the PDP. That, Sentry gathered, was the situation until Jegede renewed his gubernatorial ambition and current Deputy Governor, Agboola Ajayi, challenged him for the PDP ticket. It was gathered that Mimiko, though no longer a member of the PDP, did not hide his opposition to Ajayi’s ambition and also frowned at his return to the party. Insiders say he’s still very bitter over the roles played by Ajayi in the PDP’s loss to APC in 2016. Ajayi himself then an associate of Mimiko’s and a serving member of the Federal House of Representatives dumped PDP and pitched his tent with Akeredolu and APC, emerging as the deputy governorship candidate. Reliable sources say Jegede’s victory on Wednesday didn’t come without serous input from Mimiko who reached out to his erstwhile allies and associates on the candidate’s behalf. Furthermore, Sentry learnt that he may have resolved to help Jegede defeat Akeredolu at the general election.
