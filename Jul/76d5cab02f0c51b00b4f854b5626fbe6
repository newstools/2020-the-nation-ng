The decision was the fallout of the meeting between the government and the stakeholders from the area. The lockdown is expected to commence on Tuesday, July 7, and it will be for one week in the first instance. However, if the compliance level is not encouraging, the government will announce further extension. However, the relaxation in other areas of the state has been extended by two weeks.
