 IT is no longer news that actress Regina Daniels has become the mother of a baby boy. It is also not new that celebrities like to have their babies overseas due to concerns over quality of medical facilities. But due to the ban on international flights and panic caused by Covid-19, Daniels’ possible dream of having her baby abroad was defeated.  It was only safe for her to deliver in Nigeria. Meanwhile, Actors Guild of Nigeria has paid a visit to the actress and her husband, Prince Ned Nwodo. AGN’s President, Emeka Rollas, led the team and presented a gift to the celebrity couple at their Royal Court Villa residence in Abuja. Regina has already bounced back after delivery as she was spotted playing snooker.
