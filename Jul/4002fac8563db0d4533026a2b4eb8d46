Profit after tax (PAT) showed a decline at N7.42billion for 2019 compared to N10.55billion recorded for the year ended December 2018. Addressing shareholders at the 95th Annual General Meeting of the company,  its Chairman, Nnaemeka Achebe, commended the shareholders for their trust and loyalty to the company. He noted that despite the challenging business environment, which has been complicated by the Covid-19 pandemic, the management at Unilever Nigeria would remain strategic in their approach to sustaining the company’s operations to revert to profitable and sustainable growth. “Although we are not declaring dividend for FY 2019, we are optimistic because our results show that we made progress in some other critical areas of our operations which speaks to the fact that we are on the right path to growing our business for profitability and better returns on investment for our shareholders. Therefore, the task before the Board and Management is to drive our strategic objectives that would not only keep the business afloat but also ensure it operates efficiently,” Achebe said. The Board also assured the shareholders of their commitment to good corporate governance that would, in turn, drive sustainability and efficiency across every aspect of the company’s operations.
