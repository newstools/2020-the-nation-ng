Bayelsa State Governor, Senator Douye Diri, has said his victory at the Supreme Court is attributable to God and the prayers of Bayelsans. The apex court had on Tuesday dismissed the case filed by Chief Timi Alaibe challenging Diri’s victory at the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) governorship primary election on September 3, 2019. Diri, who got a tumultuous reception upon his arrival in Yenagoa on Thursday night, said the demonstration of love and support by Bayelsans was overwhelming and heartwarming. In a statement issued on Saturday by his acting Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Dan Alabrah, the governor was joined by his deputy, Senator Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, Speaker of the House of Assembly and other legislators, top government functionaries, PDP stalwarts among others for a Victory Thanksgiving Service at the King of Glory Chapel, Government House, Yenagoa. He expressed gratitude to people of the state for their support and encouragement, adding that he never expected the display of love and warm reception when he arrived the state as late as 9pm. His words: “I never expected this kind of reception. As late as the time I arrived, people were still at the entrance into Bayelsa and up to the Government House gate. And the shocker I had was inside of this chapel. This victory is not mine. You are the owners of this victory.” Diri, who acknowledged the role of God in his emergence as governor, also applauded the Supreme Court Justices for their uprightness and courage in upholding justice in dispensing of their duties. “I want to use this opportunity to appreciate the Supreme Court Justices for their display of integrity. This judgement has shown to the whole world that indeed the apex court is the last hope for the common man.” Speaking to journalists after the service, Diri said he would soon constitute his cabinet and put governance on track having dispensed with his major court case.
