 PUPILS in terminal classes in both public and private schools resumed in Oyo State yesterday after almost four months of staying at home as part of the measures to contain the spread of COVID-19. The pupils resumed for classes as early as 8:00a.m. in many schools. Others still allowed pupils to resume till 9:00a.m before beginning academic activities. In the schools visited, the pupils were directed to their classes which have been reorganised for social distancing. After settling down, teachers addressed the pupils on the new guidelines. They educated them on the virus, how it can be contracted and the need to observe the protocols for their safety and that of staff. The pupils were divided into more arms for social distancing purpose. At the Methodist Grammar School, Bodija, Junior Secondary School (JSS3) pupils, who were hitherto clustered into only two arms, have now been spread to six arms. Senior Secondary School (SSS3) pupils were also reorganised accordingly. The principal, Mr. Emmanuel Ajadi, explained that absence of the pupils in other classes made the reorganisation possible, adding that more teachers have been redeployed to join those teaching the terminal classes. He said only one pupil was barred from entering the school for failure to wear face mask. Ajadi added that about 70 per cent of the pupils resumed yesterday, expressing confidence that others will join during the week. Chairman, Oyo State Nigerian Union of Teachers (NUT) Mr. Samson Adedoyin said teachers were excited to resume work after about four months of staying at home. On concern being nursed by some teachers, Adedoyin said teachers would not contract the virus from pupils if they follow the protocols put in place by health experts and make extra efforts to keep themselves safe.
