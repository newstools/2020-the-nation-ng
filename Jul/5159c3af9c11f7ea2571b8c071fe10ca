The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has won all the positions contested in the local government council election in Taraba State on Tuesday. With the main opposition All Progressives Congress (APC) opting out of the race, the PDP was largely unopposed at the polls. Chairman of the Taraba State Independent Electoral Commission (TSIEC), Dr. Philip Duwe, who announced the results on Wednesday, said the PDP won all the 16 local government chairmanship seats and all the wards’ councilorship positions in the State. Duwe, in a press conference, disclosed that three political parties (AA, APGA and PDP) had qualified to stand for the council polls. But only PDP chairmanship candidates contested the election in 15 of the 16 councils. “It was only in Jalingo that APGA fielded a candidate, but PDP convincingly won with 85 percent of the total votes cast,” he said. Duwe said the results for the councilorship election were all declared at the wards’ collation centres, in accordance with the guidelines of the election and for “transparency purposes.” The electoral commission said Certificates of Return would be issued to the poll winners, immediately. He said the election turned out a huge success, without any incidents assuring that the commission would build on the success recorded for future elections. “We must work towards improvement in order to build a better future,” he said.
