Boss Mustapha expressed anger that most Christians are exhibiting reckless confidence over the COVID-19 pandemic. He said several Christians are not following the guidelines and protocols instituted by government. Also, the World Health Organization (WHO) at the weekend announced the discontinuation of the hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir, for the treatment of hospitalised patients with COVID-19.
