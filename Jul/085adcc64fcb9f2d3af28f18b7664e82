A member of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) Board of Trustees in Anambra State, Chief Rommy Ezeonwuka has warned social media users against peddling false information targeted at creating antagonism between Senator Ifanyi Uba representing Anambra South Senatorial zone and the CEO of Innoson Group, Chief Innocent Chukwuma. An online publication had alleged that Senator Uba asked a Senate Committee not to allow the Senate to patronize vehicles produced by Innoson Vehicle Manufacturing Company in Nnewi, the industrial city of the state. Ezeonwuka warned those peddling the report to desist henceforth, threatening to use his spiritual powers against social media users. He said his enquires from a competent source revealed that Uba at no point asked the Senate Committee not to approve the Senate to patronize Innoson vehicles. He said, “Uba had remained an outstanding patron of Innoson Vehicles repeatedly. Those using social media platforms to spread rumors to antagonise and blackmail the prominent Igbo industrialist and the political leaders should stop. “As the spiritual leader of the Igbo nation, I will no longer take it lightly with anybody that used social media platforms to antagonise or blackmail Ndigbo. “Those peddling the rumour must learn how to use the social media platforms to promote Igbo culture, promote goodwill, promote respect for the elders and champion the cause of good governance and welfare of the people of Igboland like the Yoruba people do.”
