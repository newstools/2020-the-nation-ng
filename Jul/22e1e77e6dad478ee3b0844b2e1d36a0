 OYO State House Assembly on Tuesday held a special sitting in honour of the late former governor Abiola Ajimobi. Addressing the Assembly, Speaker Adebo Ogundoyin said the news of the death of Ajimobi filtered into the state like a dream. He said Ajimobi’s death was unexpected and painful because he died at a time his wealth of experience was needed by the nation, especially his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC). Ogundoyin said: “O death where is thy sting? O grave where is thy victory? Ajimobi was endowed with supernatural wisdom and intelligence, the virtues which he displayed in the governance of the state in particular and the nation in general. “He was a statesman of note, as he served as a senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and governor of Oyo State for two consecutive terms, hence he became the Koseleri governor. “As the governor, he embarked on infrastructural development across the state. “ He was an amiable and humorous personality. “He impacted positively on many lives, especially his political associates.” The Speaker added that Ajimobi impacted on governance and improved environmental sanitation, especially in Ibadan.
