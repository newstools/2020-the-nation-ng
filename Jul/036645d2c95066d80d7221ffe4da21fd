 Leaders of All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ayedire/Iwo/Ayedire/Ola-Oluwa Federal Constituency in Osun State have expressed dissatisfaction about how the former Secretary to the State Government, Alhaji Moshood Adeoti, returned to the party. Adeoti left APC before the 2018 election and contested the governorship seat on the platform of the Action Democratic Party. He declared his return to APC last Friday at the party secretariat. A statement signed by 18 leaders of the party in the federal constituency condemned the mode of return of the former SSG, noting that he did not carry along officials of the party in his ward and local governments. They resolved that his action postulated disregard for the constituted authority of the party. It was advised that Adeoti should identify the leaders in the areas before things went out of control in the party.  Among those who signed the statement were APC Federal Constituency Chairman Gbadegesin Adedeji, Secretary Kola Aworinde, Commissioner for Water Resources and Energy Amidu Tadese, Health Commissioner Dr. Rafiu Isamotu, House of Assembly members Gbenga Ogunkanmi, Adegbile Abdulahi and other party executives. They expressed disappointment, saying: “The action of Alhaji Adeoti is least expected from a politician of his calibre. How can somebody of his political stature fail to realise that it is imperative to accord full recognition and honour to the political leaders at ward and local government levels? We are of the opinion that true reconciliation and reintegration should begin from the ward. A Yoruba proverb says a river that forgets its source should be prepared to dry up.” “We have resolved that his disregard for the leadership of the party at the ward and local government levels is condemnable. We implore him to do the needful by consulting with stakeholders of our party at the ward, local and state levels. A stitch in time saves nine.”
