Famous American rapper and a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump, Kanye West, has announced his bid to contest for the American presidency. The rapper took to his verified Twitter handle to disclose that he would run for president in 2020 in an apparent challenge to Trump and his presumptive Democratic rival and former Vice President, Joe Biden. He tweeted: “We must now realise the promise of America by trusting God, unifying our vision and building our future. I am running for president of the United States.” However, it was not immediately clear if West was serious about vying for the presidency four months before the Nov. 3 election or if he had filed any official paperwork to appear on state election ballots. The deadline to add independent candidates to the ballot has not yet passed in many states. The rapper and his equally famous wife Kim Kardashian West have visited Trump in the White House.
