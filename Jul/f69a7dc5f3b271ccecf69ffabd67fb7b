BELLA Disu is the executive vice-chairman of Globacom and a non-executive director of Julius Berger Nigeria Plc. She’s one of the children of billionaire telecoms magnate, Dr. Mike Adenuga Jr. But Bella isn’t the only female child of the Adenuga clan. She will readily tell friends and business associates about her younger sister, who is immensely brilliant and towing her path. If Bella strikes you as the definition of a successful woman aiming for the skies, then 25-year-old Sade Adenuga will wow your mind. A chance meeting with Sade reveals her father’s genes oozing from her. The young lady, who turned 25 in July, is a certified Barrister and Solicitor of the Supreme Court of Nigeria. Said to be one of her dad’s pride, she received the Entrepreneur of the Decade Award bestowed on her dad, at The THISDAY 2020 Awards. Like her sisters, Sade is another beautiful yet brilliant daughter from the business guru known as The Bull.
