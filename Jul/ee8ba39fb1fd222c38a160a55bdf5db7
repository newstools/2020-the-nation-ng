Medical doctors in Delta State on Thursday said it will embark on a three day warning strike to protest alleged refusal of the state government to implement COVID-19 hazard allowance for health workers. The Nation learnt that the warning strike will commence next Monday, to end on Wednesday. The Nation gathered that the stateâ€™s Medical Association, decided on this course of action after a series of deadlocked meeting between government representatives and doctors.
