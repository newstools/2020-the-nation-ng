 TWO suspected armed robbers arrested by police in Lagos have said they robbed to generate funds to start a restaurant and bar business. The suspects, Sule Abdulkareem and Celestine Joseph attempted to rob a taxi driver of his vehicle, which they planned to use as collateral for a loan, police said. “We initially wanted to rob him but when he did not stop, we jettisoned the idea before we were arrested by the police,” Abulkareem said. “My friend (Celestine) needed N1.6m to start up a business and we looked everywhere for loan but there was nobody to give us. “It was while we were looking for loan that somebody told us that we would need collateral to get a loan.  We had wanted to use that Toyota Corolla as our collateral to get the money, but unfortunately we were unable to rob the driver of his car.” Commissioner of Police Hakeem Odumosu confirmed the arrest.
