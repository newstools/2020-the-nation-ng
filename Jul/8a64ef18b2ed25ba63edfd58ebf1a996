 Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kwara State has urged the House of Assembly to swear in Ibrahim Agboola, its candidate for Ilorin South in the 2019 elections. The Appeal Court on Wednesday directed that Agboola be sworn in. Dismissing a motion by All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Hassan Elewu, it ruled that APC had no candidate for the election. The court awarded N200,000 against Elewu and directed him to return all salary and allowances he had collected.  A statement by PDP Chairman Kola Shittu said the Speaker, Yakubu Danladi-Salihu, should swear in Agboola as the elected representative of Ilorin South. He said the people were appalled by Danladi-Salihu’s disregard for court judgment, judiciary and the constitution. “Your compliance with the court ruling will indicate the level of respect the Assembly’s leadership accords the people, and prevent Kwara from being perceived as a lawless state,” he said.
