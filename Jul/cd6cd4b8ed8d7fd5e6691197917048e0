 StarTimes Nigeria has entered into a partnership with leading American animation company, DreamWorks studio. The Nation reliably gathered that the cable company has finalised talks with the American studio to add the animation channel, DreamWorks, to its growing list of exciting content. In the same vein, the company through its PR manager, Lazarus Ibeabuchi, says StarTimes has brought access to viewers clamouring for a pay-as-you-go subscription package since 2017. “StarTimes Nigeria has brought access to those that were excluded from enjoying the beauty of pay-TV through its pay-as-you-go bundle. This is even as the brand is adding two premium sports content in September and mind-blowing animation channel, DreamWorks, to its growing list of exciting content.” Continuing, Ibeabuchi says,  “Since 2010 when StarTimes started operation in Nigeria, the company has spared no effort in realising its ambitious mission: To ensure that every African family can access, afford, watch and share the beauty of digital TV. “Because of StarTimes, the price of pay-TV has been greatly lowered, from an average $50 per month to 3 or 5 dollars per month. So we are making digital TV affordable for all families. “With as little as 160 naira daily, subscribers can watch over 80 exciting channels like Fox Life, Nat Geo Wild, StarLife, ESPN, ZeeCinema, Novela E Plus, Aljazeera, Toonami, Nickelodeon, Nollywood Plus and loads of news, music, local movie, and series channels.”
