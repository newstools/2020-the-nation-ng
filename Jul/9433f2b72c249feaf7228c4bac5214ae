A former Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Edo State, Godwin Erahon, has warned Governor Godwin Obaseki and his deputy, Philip Shaibu, to avoid desperation as standard-bearers of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the September 19 election. He urged them to avoid a repeat of the unpleasant experience of the governorship candidate of the Action Alliance (AA) in Imo State, Chief Uche Nwosu. Erahon, in an online statement, noted that the June 26 Supreme Court’s judgment in Nwosu’s suit should be an eye opener to Obaseki and Shaibu. He said: “The apex court crafted the judgment so explicitly, as if it was meant for Obasèki and Shaibu, in order to understand what awaits them in Edo State. “The Supreme Court nullified Nwosu’s nomination in AA, on the grounds that he had contested for nomination under APC. “Obaseki procured APC’s expression of interest and nomination forms, filled and returned them, and to crown it all, he attended APC’s screening, which he failed. With reference to the Supreme Court’s judgment in Nwosu’s matter, the apex court seems to have told Obaseki to stop wasting his time and money in the PDP. “The Supreme Court’s judgment ought to also sound a note of warning to Obaseki’s supporters that they are about burying themselves along with a dead body, because they are blinded by temporary pecuniary sentiment.” Erahon, a former Chairman of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Edo Council, asked the governor and his deputy to take note of Nwosu’s precedent.
