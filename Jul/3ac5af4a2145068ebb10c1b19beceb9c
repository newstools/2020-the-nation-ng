 MOVES to reconcile the two factions of the Nigeria players union under one umbrella yielded fruit yesterday with both bodies agreeing to sheath their swords and work together for the good of Nigerian football. The reconciliation meeting in Lagos, which is at the instance of ex-international and current chairman of Surulere Local Government Hon. Tajudeen Ajide, was well attended by notable stakeholders from all regions of the country. In attendance at the meeting, which took place in a high brow hotel in Surulere- Lagos, was Tijani Babangida, president of National Association of Nigerian Professional Footballers (NANPF), who led his men comprising Austin Popo, and Edema Fuludu to the discussion table while Harrison Jalla was also on hand at the head of the National Association of Nigeria Footballers, (NANF) team. 1980 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) winners Felix Owolabi coordinated the meeting which also has in attendance scores of ex-internationals and players, among them Waidi Akanni, Dahiru Sadi, Tajudeen Disu, Ganiyu Akanni, and Emmanuel Babayaro. Top on resolutions reached at the end of the meeting was the setting up of a Normalization committee to smooth grey areas and fine-tune the coming together of the bodies. The normalization committee is made up of Tijani Babangida, Harrison Jalla, Austin Popo, Clement Temile, Emmanuel Babayaro, Ik Iwuala, Princewill Ugo, and Edema Fuludu. Tajudeen Disu will oversee the committee. An elated Sadi, former NANPF helmsman said, “I am a happy man as the meeting was well attended and we were able to reconcile our differences. The two sides are one now and it is all because of Ajide who was able to broker this peace deal. The players union factions have been at dagger drawn for more than twenty years with repeated efforts to reconcile them failing. Ajide said he would be a fulfilled man if he could achieve a union of both factions. “It will give Nigerian footballers a new lease of life,” he added.
