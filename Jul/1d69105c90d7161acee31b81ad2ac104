LEEDS United have been handed the Championship title following Brentford’s defeat against Stoke. Marcelo Bielsa’s men sealed promotion to the Premier League on Friday night without kicking a ball after second-placed West Brom lost 2-1 at Huddersfield. That put the Bees in the driving seat for the second automatic spot but Stoke’s win means Leeds cannot be caught at the Championship summit. Leeds will now head to Pride Park on Sunday to face Derby – the side who beat them in the play-offs last year – with their first silverware for 28 years already secured and with two games left to play.  Former boss Howard Wilkinson said: “It means more to the Premier League than maybe it does to Leeds. “They’ll bring a lot to the party, if they do well. They’ll add to the attraction of that league, which is now a worldwide league in terms of spectators.” Jubilant fans gathered at Elland Road to celebrate the club’s return to the top table of English football, while the players were also in party mode as they danced and saluted supporters from the windows of the stadium. Videos on social media showed manager Bielsa, the inspiration behind the club’s resurgence, elbow-bumping fans near his home in Wetherby as they congratulated him.
