 Arsenal officially have the worst disciplinary record in the Premier League this season after picking up a remarkable 73 bookings and five red cards. Earlier this week, Eddie Nketiah was sent off for the Gunners just moments after coming on in the 1-1 draw against Leicester. After initially being shown a yellow, VAR intervened and correctly overturned the decision, with him going flying into the shin of James Justin with his studs raised. That was, incredibly, the fourth dismissal for Arsenal since Mikael Arteta took over, in just 16 matches. Prior to that, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was sent off against Crystal Palace, with David Luiz being shown red twice against Chelsea and then again against Manchester City. Arsenal also have the worst record for yellow cards, having been shown 73 in 34 matches â€“ 2.14 on average per game. Second to them are Watford, who have received 68 yellows and three reds. The team with the best disciplinary record in the English top-flight is Liverpool, who have been shown 31 yellows and just one red after Alisson was dismissed against Brighton back in November.
