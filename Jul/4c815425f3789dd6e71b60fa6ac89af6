The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has celebrated with Muslim Ummah on the commemoration of Eid ul-Adha, the important Islamic festival which remembers the total submission of Prophet Ibrahim to Almighty Allah. The party, in a statement by its deputy National Publicity Secretary, Yekini Nabena, urged Muslims to adhere to the teachings of the Islamic festival, which places value on sacrifice and selflessness to one another. The statement reads: “The important Islamic festival teaches us the value of sacrifice and selflessness to one another irrespective of our perceived differences – religious, tribal, ethnic, political, cultural among others. “In the end, we are all human beings and its humane to look out for ourselves, particularly the disadvantaged and less-privileged around us. “We must therefore resist and reject divisive elements who try to spread hate and intolerance instead of harmony and peaceful coexistence. Their intentions are myopic, self-serving, unprogressive and evil.” The party assured Nigerians President Muhammadu Buhari was unrelenting in the fight against corruption despite skewed narratives from opposition parties. “The fight against corruption is total and unsparing as recent inquests and prosecutions undertaken by the current government have shown. “Doubters and naysayers are welcome to test the administration’s resolve to fight corruption. The full weight of the law awaits them.” As the Muslim Ummah mark the festival, the party urged all to stay safe and observe public health protocols, including safe distancing because the coronavirus (COVID-19) remains a deadly global pandemic.
