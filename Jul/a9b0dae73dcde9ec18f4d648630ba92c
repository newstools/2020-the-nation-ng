The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) yesterday re-arraigned a member of the Presidential Committee on procurement of arms and equipment in the Armed Forces, Air Commodore Umar Mohammed (retd.), at a Federal High Court in Abuja. Mohammed was re-arraigned with his company, Easy Jet Integrated Services Limited, before Justice Inyang Ekwo. They were re-arraigned on an amended five-count charge bordering on money laundering, illegal possession of firearms and possession of official documents without lawful authority. Mohammed pleaded not guilty to all counts, just as same plea was entered for his company. Following the not guilty plea, prosecuting counsel, Mr Sanusi Dakat, prayed the court for a date to begin trial. Counsel to the defendant, Mr Y. D. Dangana, prayed the court to re-admit Mohammed to bail on the conditions earlier granted by the previous judges he was arraigned before. In his ruling, Justice Ekwo admitted Mohammed to bail on the terms earlier granted and adjourned the matter till October 12 to 15 for trial.
