 The Coalition for A Better Nigeria yesterday said President Muhammadu Buhari is on course to fulfil his campaign promises in the area of job creation. It said the move to recruit 774,000 persons across the country for the Federal Government Public Work jobs, under the Federal Ministry of Labour and Productivity, would reduce the national youth unemployment rate. The group’s National Coordinator, Awa Bamiji, in a statement described as “good” the news of appointment of various states’ committee members that will recruit 1000 volunteers in each local government of the 36 states including Federal Capital Territory (FCT). He said: “This is another area of Federal Government’s intervention, apart from the ongoing Npower jobs employing between 300,000 to 500,000 youths regularly, towards ensuring drastic reduction in unemployment rate among the teeming youths. We congratulate President Muhammadu Buhari for making his campaign promises become a reality in the area of job creation, apart from other key sectors.”  It also praised Minister of State, Labour and Productivity Festus Keyamo, SAN, “on this enviable height.” The group also felicitated with Lagos State Governor Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu; Speaker of the House of Representatives Mr Femi Gbajabiamila and Iyaloja-General of Nigeria Chief Folashade Tinubu-Ojo, who recently marked their birthdays. It also described the emergence of the Awujale of Ijebuland Oba Sikiru Adetona, and Iyalode of Yorubaland, Alaba Lawson as committee members to recruit youths for the Federal Government Public Work jobs in Ogun State as “highly commendable.” The group also expressed sadness at the death of a former Secretary – General of the National Conscience Party (NCP), Ayodele Akele.
