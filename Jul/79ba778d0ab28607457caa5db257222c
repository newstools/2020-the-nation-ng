 THE President of Association of Resident Doctors, Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital (ARD, OOUTH), Dr. Mutiu Popoola has announced that their members working at the COVID-19 Isolation Centre will henceforth join the ongoing industrial action as the state government has chosen to ignore their demands. In a letter jointly signed by the union’s President, Dr. Mutiu Popoola, and the General Secretary, Dr. Tope Osundara, the doctors appreciated the effort of the government at a timely resolution of the indefinite industrial action embarked upon since July 1, 2020 by ARD OOUTH, even as it said government has shown no serious commitment to their demands. “We had high hopes of a quick resolution before now, but it is unfortunate to see that Ogun State government is not ready to come to grips with facts and necessity.”
