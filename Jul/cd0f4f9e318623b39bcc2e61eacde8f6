If feelers from Kwara State are anything to go by, the national leadership of APC must move swiftly to intervene in the lingering rift between the chairman, Bashir O. Bolarinwa and Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq. Sentry can reliably report that the state chapter of APC is divided into two groups, if not factions, with the APC Deputy Chairman, Abdullahi Samari, leading a group perceived to be loyal to the governor and Bolarinwa the other. Findings show that the Bolarinwa group, which reportedly enjoys the support of Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, is blaming the governor for the crisis in the party, accusing him of working for the sack of the incumbent party chairman at all cost. Samari, however, exonerates AbdulRazaq from the crisis rocking the party. According to him, the rumblings center round the failure of a segment of the executive to render accounts or relate with other members of the exco as equal stakeholders. Whatever may be the cause or causes of the rift, unless APC National Caretaker Committee chairman, Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni and his men act swiftly, Otoge may become Otunya in Kwara sooner than many expected.
