No fewer than 13 members of a household were on Wednesday shot dead by suspected bandits in Agudu community in Kogi-Koton-Karfe council area of Kogi State. Commissioner of Police Ede Ayuba told journalists in Lokoja, the state capital, that another person was also killed in the attack, bringing the number of casualties to 14. Six persons were injured, Ayuba said. “For a man to lose his life and 12 other members of his immediate family, leaving a son as survivor, calls for concern,” the CP said. A suspect has also been arrested in the killing of one Innocent Ofodile, owner of a Lokoja supermarket, Ayuba said. Ayuba was speaking during the parade of 23 suspects arrested in parts of the state, though unconnected to yesterday’s attack. Police spokesman William Aya said they were arrested for armed robbery, banditry, kidnapping, possession of illegal firearms, and impersonation, while others were held for car and motorcycle snatching and possession of a human skull. Items recovered from the hoodlums include one Ak 47, seven locally-fabricated pistols, one Beretta pistol, one single-barrel gun, ammunitions, four motorcycles, three Toyota cars and a human skull.
