The All Progressives Congress (APC) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have disagreed over governorship campaigns and rallies in Edo State. Oshiomhole had fired salvos at Governor Godwin Obaseki in Benin, the state capital, for desperation and lack of principle. He said the governor, unlike him who stayed on in the party despite losing the position of chairman, the governor defected to the PDzp after losing the APC ticket. Oshiomhole said Obaseki should pack and go, adding that his second term ambition will crumble in the PDP. But, Chief Charles Idahosa,  former Commissioner for Information and PDP chieftain said Ishiomjole was insensitive, judging by his decision to hold the rally at a time the state was mourning the death of a former Speaker of the House of Assembly, Zakawanu Garuba. He said what was important at the time of the rally was the fate og the wife and relatives of the former speaker, who were also kidnapped while on their away to the funeral, and not a rally. Idahosa said: “Oshiomhole sneaked into Edo state. I never believed that after the humiliation Oshiomhole has gone through, he will still come back to Benin to arrange motorcycles, taxi drivers for a rally while his people in his constituency were mourning the sudden death of the former Speaker. “He went to Abuja to represent us as national chairman for four years, but he could only do two years and two days before he was booted out of office. I feel so embarrassed with what he is doing”. Idahosa said contrary to Oshionhole’s projections, Obaseki will spring surprise at the poll. He added:“Everywhere is calm. We are just waiting for September 19 so that the people of Edo can go and vote for Governor Godwin Obaseki. It is a fait accompli”.
