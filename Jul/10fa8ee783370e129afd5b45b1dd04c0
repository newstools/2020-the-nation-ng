THE Constitution is clear on how the president,  vice president, governor and deputy governor can be impeached.  But state lawmakers,  who are  beholden to governors, are ever ready to dance to these people’s  tune whenever they are quarrelling with their deputies. To satisfy a governor, they can turn the Constitution on its head so as to flush out his deputy. But Ondo State Chief Judge, Justice Oluwatoyin Akeredolu, refused to be part of this shenanigan when she rejected the House of Assembly’s request to raise a seven-man panel to probe Deputy Governor Agboola Ajayi, who is squabbling with Governor Rotimi Akeredolu. Ajayi has since left the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Her Lordship told the lawmakers to satisfy the constitutional requirements first before asking her to discharge her own responsibility. That’s how it should be, milord. He who comes to equity must come with clean hands
