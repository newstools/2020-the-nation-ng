The Minister of Defence, Maj Gen Bashir Salihi Magashi (rtd), has called for an end to terrorism and banditry in the North. He enjoined the Muslim Ummah to take advantage of the celebration of the Eidil – Adah, known as the  Festival of Sacrifice, to  promote  peaceful  co-existence and pray for an end to insecurity in Nigeria. Magashi made the call in his Sallah message. Special Assistant to Minister of Defence on Media and Publicity, Mr Mohammad Abdulkadir, in a statement quoted the Minister as saying that, “at this period of our national life, every  Nigerian should be committed to complimenting  government’s  efforts to end banditry, insurgency  and other criminalities  in parts of the country. “The security of the nation is a civic responsibility of all and should not be perceived  erroneously as the exclusive  preserve  of the Fighting  Forces”. The Minister also called for collective resolve to evolve ways to deepen the ethos and ethics  of service and sacrifice to the nation at this holy period  when Muslims  perform sacrificial offerings  of rams in supplication to the Almighty Allah. He noted that the Festival of Sacrifice at this point in time offers splendid opportunity for Muslims to render sincere prayers for the nation to overcome her security challenges. Magashi assured that the Commander-In- Chief of the Armed Forces, President Muhammadu Buhari, is deploying sufficient political will and necessary machineries to decisively deal with all threats to Nigeria’s territorial integrity for peace and tranquillity to reign in the troubled spots.
