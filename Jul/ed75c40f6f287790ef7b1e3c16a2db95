 FORMER Senate President, Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki, has felicitated with Muslims across the country on the celebration of this yearâ€™s Eid-el-Kabir. He urged them to pray for the unity, development and security of Nigeria. In a statement issued on Thursday by his Media Office in Abuja, Saraki advised Muslims to know that the nation is facing many challenges which pose serious threat to its unity and progress, noting that citizens need to rededicate themselves physically, spiritually and intellectually to the cause of saving and serving the country. He said a period like that of Eid-el-Kabir, a season of sacrifice and demonstration of faith, provides an opportunity for such renewal of patriotism. The Eid-el-Kabir festival, Saraki said, symbolises the voluntary obedience of Prophet Ibrahim (ASW) to the commands of Allah and the demonstration of his faith in his maker. He urged Muslims to remember that Allah commands them to obey the laws of their land, comply with lawful directives from the government of the day, live in peace with their neighbours and commit their affairs into the hands of the ultimate controller.
