The Lagos State Government said it has adopted internationally-accepted safety protocols in curbing the spread of the coronavirus across the state, including the deployment of 100 units of handwashing stations to strategic locations in its 20 local governments and Local Council Development Areas. The handwashing stations were produced by the state government, in collaboration with Procter and Gamble (P&G) Nigeria. Speaking at the inauguration and deployment of the Hand Washing Stations yesterday, the stateâ€™s deputy governor, Dr. Obafemi Hamzat, said the initiative would complement several other efforts of the state government already deployed in the management of the virus.  He stated that the establishment of various Isolation centres, where those infected by the virus are being treated across the state, the initial state-wide lockdown as well as the various ongoing enlightenment campaigns on how Lagosians can protect themselves from being infected are some of the initiatives already adopted by the state government since the inception of the index case of COVID-19 in February this year.
