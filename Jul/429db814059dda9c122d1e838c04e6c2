 THE Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 and the Nigeria Governors Forum have endorsed the COVID-19 Incidence and Resource Tracker, Dashboard and Predictive Analytic Platform (Systems Platform) to assist the containment of the pandemic in Nigeria. Its development was funded by the Africa Initiative for Governance (AIG) in partnership with the Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG) and the Federal Government. The Systems Platform solution is expected to provide a robust, up-to-date database of Federal and sub-national resource and availability requirements for the COVID-19 response, based on the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommended resource specifications on packages for COVID-19. “Once deployed, the Systems Platform will provide a National and Sub-National Inventory Management System that gives national visibility of what is procured, in-stock and out-of-stock across the Federal and state testing, treatment and isolation centres,” said NESG Chief Executive Officer ‘Laoye Jaiyeola. “The real-time data provided will enable government, the private sector, international organisations and other donors to mobilise more effectively in providing the critical human and material resources needed to support the country’s response to the pandemic,” she added. On May 19, the PTF endorsed the partnership between Africa Initiative for Governance and the NESG for the development of the Systems Platform, which is deployed in collaboration with the Nigeria Governors’ Forum. AIG Director Ofovwe Aig-Imoukhuede said: “Beyond improving the transparency, accountability and governance of national resources co-sourced from the public, private and development sectors towards the COVID-19 response, the Predictive Analytic Model embedded in the platform will enable the PTF and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) predict and project the rate of infections, deaths and consequent resource requirements. This is key for the future of Nigeria’s COVID-19 response.”
