The ongoing move to impeach Deputy Governor of Ondo State, Hon Agboola Ajayi, has been stalled following refusal of the Chief Judge of the State, Justice Olaranwaju Akeredolu, to set up a seven-man investigative panel. Speaker Bamidele Oleyelogun had written to the Chief Judge that impeachment notice has been served on Hon Ajayi. A total of 14 lawmakers signed an impeachment notice against Ajayi. Speaker Oleyelogun informed Justice Akeredolu that setting up of the panel was in line with section 188 (5) of the 1999 Constitution as amended. A letter to the CJ and signed by the Speaker reads: “By the Resolution of the House today pursuant to Section 188 (3) and (4) of the 1999 Constitution as amended it was resolved that the allegations be investigated forthwith. “It is in line with the above that request that you set up the 7-man panel to conduct the investigation as resolved by the Honourable House and the Panel, shall soon as possible, report back to the House.” But the Justice Akeredolu, in a letter dated July 9 and addressed to the Speaker, said the lawmakers have not completed the constitutional process that would lead the Speaker to invite her to set up an investigative panel as stipulated by the Constitution. Akeredolu said she also received a letter from Kayode Olatoke SAN that the matter of the impeachment of Ajayi was subjudice.
