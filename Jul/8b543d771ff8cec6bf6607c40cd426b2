Ondo State People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has urged the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to carry out testing and isolate lawmakers and other aides that accompanied Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu to Abuja to purchase nomination and expression of interest forms of the All Progressives Congress (APC). It said it was concerned about the possibility of identifying, isolating and testing those who might have been exposed to the governor, particularly within the last 14 days. The Ondo PDP said it was quite unfortunate that the governor’s actions during his trip to Abuja to submit his nomination form might have also exposed members of the House of Assembly, who joined him on the trip. A statement by its spokesman, Zadok Akintoye, said the party was glad that the governor is at the moment asymptomatic. According to the statement: “A viral video clearly showing the governor sneezing into his hands in the midst of the honourable members of the House of Assembly, was shared online, making it imperative that the NCDC  takes immediate action in testing and isolating anyone who may have been exposed to the governor within the last few days. “Our prayers and best wishes go to the governor at this time and we hope that the lessons learnt would help in ensuring greater compliance with lay down rules for mitigating the spread of the virus.”
