A Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship aspirant in Ondo State, Mr. Banji Okunomo, has called for prayers for quick recovery of Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu from the Coronavirus infection. Okunomo, in a statement issued yesterday in Okitipupa, said political affiliation notwithstanding, he sympathised with the governor and wished him speedy recovery. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Akeredolu on June 30 announced that he tested positive for COVID-19 and had gone into isolation, in accordance with the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) guidelines. Okunomo, while stating that COVID-19 was real, urged the people to adhere to the NCDC guidelines and obey precautionary measures, to curtail further spread of the disease. “Notwithstanding our different political affiliations, I sympathise with Akeredolu, who recently confirmed that he tested positive for Coronavirus. “I pray for his speedy recovery. May God lay His healing hands on him, even as I urge our people in Ondo State to pray fervently for the governor’s quick recovery. “I advise those already in contact with him to go for test and self-isolate themselves. COVID-19 is not a death sentence, if detected early and treated in time,” he said.
