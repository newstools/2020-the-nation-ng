The National Apex of Nigerian Farmers’ Cooperative Society (NANFACOS) wants President Muhammadu Buhari to give priority to the private sector to enable them drive the nation’s agriculture value chain for the country to become self-sufficient in food production. The association said for the country to become a global force in agriculture like Israel, the federal government must support farmer cooperatives in areas of loans and grants. NANFACOS lamented the impact of Covid-19 on farmers, calling on the federal government for financial and material assistance. According to the association, the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic has set farming activities back. The Acting National President of NANFACOS, Chief Nwogwugwu Uzoma, made the call during a meeting with all state presidents and farmers in Abuja. He commended President Muhammadu Buhari for his determination to make agriculture the mainstay of the economy.
