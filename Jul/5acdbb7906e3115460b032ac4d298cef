 A NON-profit organisation with focus on checking child abuse, CeCe Yara Foundation, has partnered Edu360 (a platform powered by Union Bank PLC) to raise awareness about child molestation in Nigeria. To achieve this, both partners plan to run a two-month campaign with the theme: It Ends Now. CeCe Yara Founder Mrs. Bola Tinubu said child molestation has significant negative effects, such as social exclusion, low self-esteem, resentment and bitterness as well as other mental and physical health issues.  She urged Nigerians to join hands in protecting children from the criminal violation. “Every minute, 23 Nigerian children are sexually abused. This cruel infringement of children’s rights must end now. As adults, we all play a critical role in protecting children and preventing child sexual abuse. It is time to take off the burden of protection for children who should be able to depend on us.” Head of Corporate Communications and Marketing at Union Bank PLC, Ogochukwu Ekezie-Ekaidem, said Edu360 was partnering CeCe Yara Foundation on the campaign because it aligns with the focus to foster an environment where children are truly safe to learn and thrive.
