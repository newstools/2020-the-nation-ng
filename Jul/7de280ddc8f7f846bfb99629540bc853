Simy Nwankwo scored his 17th goal in the Serie B this season as Crotone grabbed a crucial away victory by defeating Citadel 3-1 on Friday and he has said his target is the Serie B top scorer award. The Super Eagles forward doubled the Pythagoreans’ lead in the 37th minute, after Junior Messias broke the deadlock at the Pier Cesare Tombolato Stadium in the 11th minute. He made it four goals in his last five league outings after scoring a hat-trick in Crotone’s 3-0 victory over Benevento last Friday. The effort was Simy’s 17th goal after 32 league outings in this campaign, and he is currently the joint-second top scorer in the Italian second division, with a goal behind Perugia’s Pietro Iemmello. Four minutes into the second half, Messias sealed maximum points for the visitors with his second goal of the night which has now made them unbeaten in their last nine league matches.
