 THE governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Edo State, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, has asked People’s Democratic Party (PDP) leaders to clear their infamous status of tax collector, ascribed to them by Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike. He was reacting to a challenge by PDP leaders for him to provide evidence of goodwill from the former National Chairman of APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, who is an ex-Edo State governor. Ize-Iyamu, the 2016 governorship candidate of the PDP in Edo State, described PDP as a fallen party in tattered rags, “authoring an allegory of tax collectors and a Zacheus who must remain short of his non-negotiable second-term ambition.” Ize-Iyamu, through the Director of Communication and Media of his campaign organisation, Prince John Mayaki, asked PDP leaders to focus on their internal squabbles, exacerbated by the divisiveness of Obaseki, who he accused of obtaining the party’s ticket forcibly, through a national imposition by induced tax collectors.
