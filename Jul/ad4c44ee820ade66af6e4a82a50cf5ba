The Ebonyi State Police Command has warned robbers planning to launch operation in Afikpo town that their plan will boomerang. The command said it will not allow criminals to hatch their plans in the ancient city. The community has been thrown into panic following a letter the unknown robbers reportedly wrote to the community notifying them of their planned visit for their operation. The robbers also wrote to one of the old generation banks in the area. But the police spokesman in the state, Loveth Odah in a reaction on Wednesday said any attempt to forment trouble in the area by any person or group of persons would be met with stiff resistance. She said: “Whether the letter is known or unknown, every incident of crime will be tracked and tackled by the State Police Command. We are working in collaboration with other security forces including vigilantes to track down hoodlums and anybody that wants to cause confusion in the state. “We want warn them to steer clear of Ebonyi State. Whether the plan is real or fake, it must boomerang. No kidnapping case in Ebonyi has lasted beyond more than three hours, because we have a network of policing, even down to the local government and community levels. “The pressure from our men will not allow them to hatch their plans. Ebonyi, I repeat is not a safe haven for criminals. We are in collaboration with those that matter in the security architecture of the state. The members of the public should go about their normal businesses and report any suspicious movement or individuals to the Police,” she said.
