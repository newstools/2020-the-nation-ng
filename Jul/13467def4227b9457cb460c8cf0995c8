Super Eagles head coach, Gernot Rohr has for the umpteenth time asserted that delaying the Africa Cup of Nations from January 2021 to January 2022 was not a bad idea after all. The German said it was very appropriate to move the tournament for another year to enable teams have time to prepare in the wake of the Coronavirus pandemic. The CAF Executive Committee reached a decision fortnight ago to move the biggest African football tournament from 2021 to 2022 due to COVID-19. “The Africa Cup of Nations is postponed. It’s the same for everyone so it’s not a drawback,” Rohr told Girondins4ever. “We have more time to prepare as well as for other countries. We can continue the play-offs and start the World Cup qualifiers at the same time. However, the German trainer admitted that 2022 will be a difficult year for the Super Eagles. “But it will be a difficult 2022 year because already in 2021, there are a lot of qualifying matches to play for the team. “I think we will have time to play a few friendlies. In the year 2022, if we have qualified for the World Cup and the AFCON, there will be many, many games to play. So it will certainly be a difficult year.”
