Nollywood Media And Research Centre, a new information resource hub for film practitioners and journalists has been born. The centre is a brainchild of Azuh Amatus, a media executive and publisher of Daylight News. Amatus noted that NOMAREC is out to provide media-driven and in-depth research on Nollywood – the globally renowned Nigerian motion picture industry, its practitioners, and various publics. In a statement by Azuh, the center serves as a rendezvous for journalists, filmmakers, professionals, scholars, researchers, film writers, students, entertainment enthusiasts, agencies, and stakeholders within and outside Nigeria to access media-related and industry data on Nollywood, virtually. Shedding more light on the research center, Azuh disclosed that it is a one-stop virtual shop for reliable media contents and information on Nollywood. He further stated that the center is basically out to help expand the frontiers of Nollywood by assisting individuals, corporate bodies, and government agencies to conduct media-related research on Nollywood and its various publics with ease and adherence to global best practices. Elaborating on the vision, Azuh said the center is using the media to create easy access for information flow and research on Nollywood and its stakeholders, while their mission is to use the media to provide basic information about Nollywood to those seeking to work, invest, collaborate and know more about the industry.  “We are equally proud of our core values, which are robust media contents, strong Nollywood background, reliable information, and deep research,” Azuh concluded.
