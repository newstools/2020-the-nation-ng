 The campaign materials, which were rolled out with funfair and intense grassroots mobilisation, took place at the oldest elementary school, St. Andrew’s Anglican Primary School, Ayede Ogbese, Akure North Local Government Area. Oluyede said, the governor deserved a second term on account of his giant strides taken in the last three and a half years. He enumerated some of the achievements of Akeredolu to include clearing of backlog of debts owed to public servants by the preceding administration, the repairs and building of schools, the rehabilitation and construction of reticulated boreholes in many villages, hamlets and towns across Ondo State. Oluyede said it would not be proper to allow the baton of leadership to pass on to individuals in whose hands the people could suffer. The representative of Governor Akeredolu at the event, Afolabi Ojo, said that the model of campaign contributions from Prince Oluyede signaled a positive departure from the past when contestants were often left to carry the burden of funding all alone. Ojo expressed the gratitude of his principal, promising that the provision of infrastructures to the locality would continue unabated. A commissioner-designate, Idowu Otetubi, who was also at the event said that opponents and challengers to Akeredolu have no antecedents that could match what the administration has  achieved so far. The Ward Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC), Emmanuel Olubi, said the party and Akeredolu have contributed immensely to the rising profile of Ayede Ogbese in the annals of Nigeria.
