Following the announcement of the much anticipated reality TV show, Big Brother Naija, which is set to commence July 19th, preparations for the incoming housemates is ongoing. According to a report by tribune online, the organisers of the reality show, during a virtual press briefing, revealed that after rigorous verification and online sorting of over 30,000 entries, selected housemates have proceeded on quarantine since Wednesday, in line with the guidelines provided by the NCDC. The organisers hinted that for this year’s edition of the popular reality TV show, carefully tested measures have been put in place to ensure minimal contact with outsiders once the housemates are in the house and also revealed that the favourite ‘ninjas’ may not be very visible during the show owing to COVID-19 realities. The show’s main sponsor, sports betting company, BetWay, also revealed a bigger payout for the winner of the show this year, as well as other mouth-watering prizes for fans of the show.
