 Many would wonder why Princess Toyin Kolade, who dwells with the sobriquet ‘Iyalaje Apapa’ loves to celebrate her birthday yearly with much fanfare. The simple reason is that she is an individual who values life. Kolade is of the opinion that witnessing another year on planet earth is a rare privilege from the creator which must be appreciated dearly. Just like every other July 13, she would host all sundry at her palatial New Oko-Oba mansion in Lagos to a classy birthday soiree. This year’s edition took a new shape as she celebrated with no fanfare due to the COVID-19 restriction on large gatherings. She celebrated with a few friends and her immediate family members. Those present at her palatial home were pampered lavishly to an array of continental and local dishes laced with an unending supply of high-end drinks. The Fisolak Global Resource boss, with a gleeful smile on her face, sauntered majestically to her sitting room fitted on a well-knitted all-white lace outfit with a dish-like headgear. She was taken by surprise by her children who sang birthday songs for her and presented her with a collection of gigantic birthday cakes.
