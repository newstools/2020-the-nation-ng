 THE World Health Organisation (WHO) has emphasised its readiness to collaborate with faith-based organisations bodies like The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations (The SCOAN) to advance the cause of the war against the deadly virus. It stated this while responding to a video of a Cameroonian medical doctor Kameni Pierre, claiming to have been healed of COVID-19 by Pastor TB Joshua via through his church channel Emmanuel TV. “Certainly, spiritual leadership is very important in times like this,” WHO Executive Director of Health Emergencies, Dr. Michael Ryan said, lauding the role of faith-based organisations in providing accurate information to communities. Speaking further, the WHO Director-General, Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus added that faith and science should “go together”. “We know many religious leaders who would really advise their followers to follow their faith and at the same time use science. The two do not contradict; they go together… We will call on all religious leaders to be in this fight and save lives,” he stated. Ghebreyesus, Ryan and other WHO officials were questioned about the miracle by a Cameroonian journalist Simon Ateba during an interactive media session on Wednesday. In the video, Dr. Pierre, a gynecologist and obstetrician, said he was suffering from COVID-19 and was in isolation in a hospital ward when he called in via video to receive prayer during an interactive programme on Emmanuel TV.
