 EX-AIDES to Governor Godwin Obaseki and elected council officials, who were allegedly illegally sacked and forced to resign after victimisation by the government, have met the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu. They declared their support for him. The council officials and former aides decried Obaseki’s alleged tyranny and the oppressive treatment meted out to them for refusing to join the governor’s late hour defection to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), “where his candidacy has continued to polarise the party and widen the schism between its state chapter and the Abuja tax-collectors.” They vowed to insist on their choice of the APC and Ize-Iyamu, saying Obaseki’s intimidation only fuelled their zeal to vote for Ize-Iyamu, the former Secretary to the State Government (SSG), on September 19. Addressing victims of Obaseki’s alleged tyranny, Ize-Iyamu condemned the Edo governor’s intolerance and disregard for the people’s right and freedom to make a political choice, including that of a party. He told them that his team was planning to hire lawyers and challenge in court, Obaseki’s illegal denial of their entitlements and other emoluments to elected council officials, who insisted on maintaining their membership of the APC. Ize-Iyamu said: “I will advise Obaseki to remember that there is life after politics. Harassing people and denying them what is due to them by law, because they exercised their right of association, is an act of tyranny that is outside the laws of Edo State.
