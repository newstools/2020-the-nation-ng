 TWENTY members of the Onigbongbo community in Lagos have benefited from the micro-credit empowerment scheme of the Rotary Club of Onigbongbo. Each beneficiary got N50,000. They included Mrs Opeyemi Sadiq-Oseni, Lawal Sakirat, Adeboyega Adeola, Alimi Ronke, Muritala Akeem, and Afini Rasaq Olarenwaju. Its President, Olajide Ajayi, said the club embarked on the project in partnership with Petrocam Services and YCT Microfinance Bank Limited, to boost the growth of small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs) in the area. He said the fund was interest-free. He noted that some SMEs found it difficult to access funds from banks and that with their intervention, the beneficiaries would have cash to fund their businesses. Thanking the sponsors for their assistance, he urged the beneficiaries to use the money wisely to enable them pay back. He warned that it was not a palliative from the club or the government but a loan. He said the repayment would encourage the club to continue the scheme. Rotary International District 9110 Governor representative Assistant Governor  Adeyemi Adedoyin also advised the beneficiaries on repayment, adding: “To whom much is given much is expected.’’ The Regent of Onigbongbo community, Alhaji Tajudeen Ajao Irawo, lauded the impact of the club’s projects and programmes in the area. He also asked the beneficiaries to justify the confidence reposed in them by repaying promptly.
