 A former governorship aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chris Ogienmwonyi, has collapsed his structure and supported the party’s standard-bearer, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu. He also donated a campaign secretariat to the APC governorship candidate. Ogiemwonyi, an engineer, represented in Benin last weekend by an APC chieftain, Samson Isigbemhe, said the collapsing of the structure across the 18 local governments and donation of the secretariat in Benin was to ensure the victory of Ize-Iyamu on September 19. He noted that he was convinced on the genuineness and leadership ability of the governorship candidate to transform the state and deliver on his SIMPLE Agenda.  Ogiemwonyi, the former minister of state for Works, advised Edo people to vote for Ize-Iyamu, saying he meant well for the state and would address the imbalances experienced under the current administration. Ize-Iyamu hailed Ogiemwonyi for his generosity, love and encouragement. He praised the former aspirant’s determination and selfless service to the development of the state. Ize-Iyamu assured the people that he would run an all-inclusive government that would prioritise youths’ and others’ empowerment.
