LXLF Limited, an online fashion retail store and subsidiary of I’s Age Limited has added designer eyewears to its online retail portfolios. The addition of designer eyewears including: Gucci, Hugo Boss, Police, Tom Ford, Rayban among others is coming less than a month after celebrating its one year anniversary. The online retail store scheduled to officially launch the eyewears on Saturday July 11, 2020 is offering a one week discount promotion. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of I’s Age Limited, Okeisolobrugwe Clifford Ikpikpini said the addition is in line with LXLF Limited’s goal to expand the categories and brand choices for customers in the Nigerian online retail market filled with so many fakes and close replicas that has forced many Nigerians to look to outward online retailers for authentic brands. Mr Ikpikpini assured LXLF’s customers that I’s Age Limited is working diligently to add more brands and categories on LXLF  Limited by getting into more retail agreements with brands directly or their Nigerian accredited dealer.
