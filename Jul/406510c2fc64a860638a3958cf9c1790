 THE Nigeria Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA), Ekiti State chapter has said no mosque in the state would open, despite the lifting of the ban imposed on religious activities by government. Governor Kayode Fayemi had recently in a statewide broadcast announced the reopening of all churches and mosques the state from July 17. A statement signed by the President, Ekiti State’s NSCIA, Alhaji Yaqubu Sanni, yesterday, said the suspension was because all the safety protocols cannot be met within the time frame stipulated by the government. “Muslims in the committee on the re-opening of worship centres and health officers educated members on how to guard themselves from COVID-19 and conditions to be met before the re-opening of mosques in the State. “After reviewing the guidelines, it was agreed that the conditions for re-opening of mosques as discussed could not be met within the stipulated time frame, that is, between now and July 17, 2020. “Hence, it was resolved that the Muslims in Ekiti State would hold on for a while in preparations to meet the conditions laid down”, Sanni said. As the religious centres reopen for operations today, government has directed all religious centres ready to resume operations to acquire certificates of fitness before commencing worship. The government said only religious centres with prevention facilities will be allowed to resume activities, while certificates of compliance must be received from the Ministry to authenticate their readiness to reopen. The Commissioner for Environment, Hon. Gbenga Agbeyo, who said this in Ado Ekiti, on Thursday, insisted that no religious centres would be allowed to resume without complying with the stipulated guidelines to curb the spread of the deadly coronavirus.
