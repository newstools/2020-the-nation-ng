Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the Nigeria Taekwondo Federation (WTF)Â  under the leadership of Margaret Binga has secured a deal with the World Taekwondo that will make it free of charge for the Nigeria Taekwondo community to sign up or renew their membership to the World Taekwondo Global Membership System for Nigeria. The WTF Global Membership System (GMS) initiative began in 2009 following a recommendation from Hoss Rafaty, who was the advisor to the WT President to Dr. Chungwon Choue, and presented the concept of creating a Global Taekwondo Database with the idea of centralizing the global taekwondo community into one online common platform. The aim of the system is to provide administration efficiencies among all taekwondo organizations & provide a global standardized software solution for all WT`s National Federations and its members to use the software and services available through the platform. The Nigeria Taekwondo Federation had officially adopted the system as its database during its 2nd board meeting in 2017, under the leadership of its first female president Margaret Binga. To complement the actions of the World Taekwondo body, the Nigeria Taekwondo Federation has also waived all 2020 annual dues for individual members, in order to further cushion the financial impact being felt by its members as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
