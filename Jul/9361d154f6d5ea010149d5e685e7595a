A civil organisation, Adegboyega Adegoke Resource Centre (AARC) in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, has trained over 200 youths in self-reliance skills. Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of AARC Adegboyega Adegoke said such training would reduce poverty and curb vices among youths. Adegoke, executive director (Finance) and chief financial officer of OES Energy, spoke with reporters at the graduation and distribution of tools to the trainees. Urging governments to invest more in vocational studies, he said they could reduce vices by encouraging youths to acquire skills. Adegoke said: “There is poverty and unemployment in the land. The government, corporate bodies, foundations and philanthropists can invest in vocational studies. “…Adegboyega Adegoke Resource Centre has organised vocational training for youths, such as candle and soap making, hairdressing, chalk making, tailoring, computer engineering, POP and others. “We are presenting tools to about 75 of them today…to obey COVID-19 protocols. Two other batches will follow soon. We are distributing … sewing machines, hair dryers, laptops, computers, generators…and cash. “We have trained people to be self-reliant and become entrepreneurs. This will help in alleviating poverty. The way the country is going, you cannot rely on white collar jobs.”
