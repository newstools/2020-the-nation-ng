Aida Benjamin is set to release her debut single titled “ Obi Uto” on August 2, 2020. Unlike your conventional musician Aida (real name Adaku Uwaoma Oseiza) does music for reasons that transcend mere entertainment. Even her resume is one you won’t find many musicians parading. For starters, she’s the current Marketing Director for Enyimba Automated Shoe Company, Abia State but the passionate musician is a whole lot more. On why she took to music, Aida said, “I decided to use my talent under the platform of my NGO to give hope as we usually do. And also to continue to encourage other Nigerians to support the less privileged, whatever we raise from our songs will continue to go to charity. I believe that God has given us talents and we must use them in one way or the other. Politics or business or career or family should not stop us. There’s no better time than now that the world needs healing right from the soul to have such an amazing single.” Aida is all fired up to release her first professional single titled “Obi Uto ( Danciya )” coming out on August 2, 2020. The single, which was produced by Mekoyo at U&I Recording Studios owned by Hon. E.J. Agbonayinma will be dropping complete with the video shot by Toca Mcbaror,” “This song brings hope and comfort while challenging us all to make the world a better place, especially by remembering the poor among us. So, I thought that the best way to use your talent is to touch lives,” she added. Aida’s story is a mix of passion, love for God and for humanity.
