 VETERAN music producer ID Cabasa has implored influential Nigerians to be careful about the impressions they pass as the country and the world at large still battle the pandemic. Cabasa said that fans and followers get influenced easily by information shared by people whom they consider role models. “As intelligent and influential people, it will be more discretional to be quiet and observe things as regards COVID-19 than building up theories around why? I don’t dispute what you feel or believe but if what u feel or believe has no facts backing it please be careful how you share these things u are feeling it is”, Cabasa stated. “You are influential and people will do without thinking whatever you say either in the right context or otherwise… And if there’s a strong conviction about what you feel please be clear so as not to confuse people with what you have not said (Which can be insinuated from what you said)” Someone said there’s no COVID-19 and all she could quote was a top MOG… and I am like “Did he ever say there is no COVID? Then she started saying everything is a hoax.. quoting theories upon theories…SMH.. 10mins after she called back panting and nearly crying that she just got a call that her younger brother was exposed to the virus. Cabasa however urged everyone to take preventive measures. “Please let’s be careful people. This stuff is real.. Let’s trust God for a cure/prevention soon while we also do our part to prevent the spread… Those who caught d virus already we pray God to heal them.”
