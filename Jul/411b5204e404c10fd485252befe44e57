COVID-19: NUJ seeks fresh lockdown in Ondo Number of infected persons in the state has crossed 300. A statement jointly signed by the Ondo NUJ Chairman, Comrade Adetona Aderoboye said the union was concerned that the state health facilities have been overstretched owing to increasing number of infected persons. Praying God to grant Akeredolu and other COVID-19 patients quick recovery, the Ondo NUJ condoled with the Governor over the death of Commissioner for Health, Wahab Adegbenro. The Ondo NUJ noted the state government was on top of COVID-19 situation until three weeks ago when it ordered reopening of religious centres, poor enforcement of 7pm to 7am dust- to- dawn curfew and total violation of precautionary measures at all markets, hotels, relaxation centres in the state without penalties against defaulters. It said the compulsory use of same was not enforced at public places. According to the statement: “The Union therefore calls on the state government to consider the option of declaring a 7days or 14days lockdown to urgently stop the spread of the coronavirus pandemic at a disturbing rate. This measure will enable the government to carry out effective contacts tracing and deploy more combative efforts both from the state and federal governments. “Ondo NUJ also pleads with striking doctors and the state government to immediately reach a compromise on disputing matters to facilitate effective treatment of COVID-19 patients.”
