 ANTHONY Joshua and Tyson Fury have met in Marbella as both British heavyweight champions holidayed amid rumours of a super fight between the pair. WBA, WBO and IBF title holder Joshua and WBC king Fury are strongly rumoured to be ready to rumble in one of the richest fights in boxing next year. The Londoner revealed that he had bumped into Fury as his arch-rival drove along the Spanish coast, even rolling down the window of his car for a chat. Sharing a photo of the tantalising coming-together on his Instagram page, Joshua added a fist punch and wrote: ‘Sweeeeeeeeeeeet Caroline!! Ohhhh ohhh ohhhhh.’ And Fury responded in kind, with a tantalising nod to next year’s proposed fight, as he promised on his Instagram story: ‘2021 it’s going off’. Joshua’s song lyrics refer to the classic Neil Diamond hit that has become synonymous with huge sporting events and would undoubtedly ring out should a scrap between the titans materialise. Joshua wore a facemask and baseball cap as he talked to Fury, who donned sunglasses and a backwards cap for his spin in the sun.
