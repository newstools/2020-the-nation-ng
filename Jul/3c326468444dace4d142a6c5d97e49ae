 A new entertainment hub has berthed on the  music scene and it’s known as Cruz Nation. The entertainment company joins the ever growing music industry to position itself and music talents in the music industry for bigger achievements. Filled with a cluster of high spirited, vastly experienced and consummate industry professionals, the company’s management said artiste and label rift will be adequately nipped in the bud in a statement. “For industry analysts, the issue of supremacy, loyalty and artiste/record label rift has been a major bane to seeing long standing, long lasting and enduring labels in contemporary African music business. To this, the Cruz Nation has ensured a transparent, well articulated, and extremely flexible contract structure that protects the interest of the company and that places the interest of talents, their gut instinct and their personal drive above every other variable,” a statement from the company said. The entertainment company owns and operates an array of businesses that are inclined to recorded music, music publishing, merchandising, and audio visual content.
