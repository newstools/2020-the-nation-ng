 Former Super Eagles goalkeeper, Ndubuisi Egbo has decried  lack of quality players in the senior national team which has made it difficult for Nigeria to run over their opponents like it used to be previously. Egbo, who  made the headlines at the weekend when he led FK Tirana to win the Albanian league title for the first time in over 10 years, said long were the days when the Super Eagles commanded huge respect due to the glut galaxy of stars in the team. “It is unfortunate; because during my time in the national team it was difficult to mention the best player because we had many quality players,” Egbo said on a WhatsApp platform. “We had Kanu Nwankwo, Finidi George, Celestine Babayaro, Tijani Babangida, and Victor Ikpeba and so on but today, where should I start from?  “ It is very difficult today. You can only count a handful of quality players today. “Back then, when you mentioned Nigeria, the  opponents were like already two goals down mentally because of the quality players in the team and they came into the game already timid. “Football has improved now and we have many African players playing in Europe; every team has experienced players now and it is now more difficult for bigger teams to run over smaller teams.” Egbo played for Julius Berger of Lagos and Al Masry of Egypt before he jetted off to Albania from where he later retired and began coaching where he currently possessed UEFA A coaching licence.
