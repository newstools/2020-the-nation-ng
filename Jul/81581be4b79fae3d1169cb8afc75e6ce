After another loss in this horrid run of form for Leicester City, Brendan Rodgers was asked if he thinks the Foxes will qualify for the Champions League. After the Toffees defeat, Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers was asked if the East Midlanders will qualify for the Champions League. And it was encouraging to hear the manager take a combative approach: “I’ve always said we’ll push to finish as high as we possibly can. If we finish outside it, then we haven’t been good enough. It’s as simple as that. You have to sustain it over 38 games. We’ve go six games to go and we have to fight to finish as high as we can.”
