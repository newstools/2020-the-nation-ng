 TRANSPORTERS in Edo State have supported Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, the candidate of the All Progressives Congress in the September 19 governorship election. Thousands of members of the Association of Professional Drivers on Wheel, led by their President, Comrade Adams Ehi, also known as Shaba, defied the rain yesterday morning for a meeting where their endorsement of the APC candidate was publicly announced. Ehi said the professional drivers abandoned their businesses to announce their endorsement of Ize-Iyamu because of their conviction in his intention and ability to transform Edo State and develop infrastructure that would lift the stateâ€™s economy and ease the transportation of residents and goods. He said the association has begun mobilisation of its members in all senatorial districts, including Edo North and Edo Central, to strengthen support for Pastor Ize-Iyamu and deliver victory for him at the polls. Other drivers hailed Ize-Iyamu for his promotion of human and infrastructural development and attested to his positive contributions to the development of the state as the Secretary to the State Government and Chief of Staff. They said his previous contributions, both as a public servant and private citizen, assured them that if elected, Pastor Ize-Iyamu would prioritise their needs and those of other Edo residents at the grassroots. Ize-Iyamu thanked members of the Professional Drivers on Wheel Association for their support and promised to ensure that no one is left behind in his empowerment and development efforts to restore economic growth.
