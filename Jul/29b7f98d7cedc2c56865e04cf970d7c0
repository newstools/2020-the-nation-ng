 A POLICEMAN has killed two persons in Aba, the commercial nerve of Abia State. An eyewitness said the two were shot by a policeman who was invited following a confrontation between officials of the state Board of Internal Revenue and a man selling bread in his vehicle. The source said, “We learnt that the man was using a private vehicle to sell bread when the task force met him. They started arguing and the man was telling them that there was nothing wrong in using his private car to sell or distribute bread. “While the quarrel was ongoing, a policeman was invited to the scene by the vehicle owner. It was in the confusion that the policeman fired his weapon to scare the crowd away. The bullets hit an  Inland Revenue man and a passerby. A senior police officer confirmed the incident, saying an investigation has started.
