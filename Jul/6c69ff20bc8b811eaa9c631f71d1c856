The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ondo State has hailed Engr. Ifeoluwa Oyedele for setting aside personal interest and ambition to step down for Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu. It described Engr Oyedele as a true party man who sacrificed his personal interest for the general interest of the party in the state. This is just as Governor Yahaya Bello who is Chairman of the Primary Committee ruled out postponement of the primary as demanded by some aspirants. The aspirants had claimed they were yet to see the delegates list less than 24 hours to the primary. But Bello who spoke at a meeting with the aspirants Sunday night said there is no perfect election anywhere in the world. A statement issued on Monday and signed by the Ondo APC Director, Media & Publicity, Steve Otaloro, said Engr. Oyedele ran one of the biggest campaign platforms in the governorship race and has invested a large chunk of his resources in funding the campaign before he decided to sacrifice all these for the overall interest of the party. Otaloro stated that Oyedele’s quest that the APC primary go without bloodshed was commendable. According to the statement, “The interest of the citizens of Ondo state is more important than my personal interest. We are determined to ensure that we work together for what will be of benefit to citizens of Ondo state. We will work together to unite our party, to rebuild the party, unite our members so that we can have a rapid economic development in the state. Also, I call on other aspirants to support us in this quest of uniting our party.”
