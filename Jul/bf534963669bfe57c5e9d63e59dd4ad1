The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Edo State chapter and the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, are bickering over funding ahead of the September 19 election. PDP, on Thursday in Benin through its Publicity Secretary, Chris Nehikhare, accused APC and its candidate of desperation to win the poll at all costs and “raiding” a national institution, the NEXIM Bank, thereby bleeding it to the outrageous tune of $500million, to be converted to a loan and the burden of repayment would be placed on Edo people. Ize-Iyamu, through his campaign organisation’s Director of Communication and Media, Prince John Mayaki, described himself as an unblemished candidate. PDP said: “It is indeed ironic that while the ruling APC’s administration prides itself as an anti-corruption government, its Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, who was caught in a video collecting gratification, has been saddled with the responsibility of delivering another governor. A lizard cannot give birth to a crocodile, no matter the size. “Let us be clear on one thing, APC has only one goal, and that goal is not fighting corruption, it is advancing its cause. This is another reason Edo people must reject the party and not allow it near the treasury. “APC’s National Campaign Council, in collaboration with a director at NEXIM Bank, has perfected plans to deplete our common patrimony by drawing down $500million to prosecute the governorship election. This unholy arrangement is absurd, illegal, criminal and must be condemned.”
