Slovakia based Nigeria defender, Celestine Lazarus, has told Gernot Rohr to extend invitation to him as Nigeria prepares for 2022 AFCON qualifiers. The Slavoj Trebišov player has enjoyed a smooth journey in Europe in the last five years and believes he has gathered enough experience to be in the star- studded national team. “Playing for my country is one of my biggest dreams coming up as a player, and I think I have gotten better credentials to don the country’s colours ahead of next AFCON,” said Lazarus.  “My coach and my teammates have been encouraging me to reach out to the national team coach for a chance in the national team but I believe my ability and hard work will take me there at the appropriate time. I am not rushing, but I am ready and ripe enough to prove a chance to play for my country.” “My uncles used to tell me about Uche Okechukwu, Stephen Keshi and others, some of them said I play like Uche because of my physique but in my club, they always see me as another player like Sergio Ramos of Real Madrid.”
