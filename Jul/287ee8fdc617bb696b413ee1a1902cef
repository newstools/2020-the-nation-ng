ARSENAL surprised bookmakers to book their place in the FA Cup final beating off Manchester City 2-0, thanks to skipper Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang who scored in both halves. Pep Guardiola’s men dominated the opening stages, with Arsenal’s defence looking nervy in possession, but it was Arsenal who would break the deadlock as Aubameyang, moments after missing a fine one-on-one chance, turned home Nicolas Pepe’s deep cross. City could not force a response before the interval, Arsenal coming close to doubling their lead as Mustafi’s header was tipped over by Ederson. But Mikel Arteta would have been delighted to head in at half-time with the lead, especially given how the game started for his side.  As expected, Man City came out with the bit between their teeth and Riyad Mahrez and Kevin de Bruyne were all over the place since the restart. Mahrez goes one-on-one with Ainsley Maitland-Niles and wins – but Emiliano Martinez in goal for Arsenal does really well to smother the shot. Man City may have had more possession, but Arsenal were the better side. The holders were fortunate that only Aubameyang’s goals have made the difference. Arsenal will take on the winner of Manchester United and Chelsea second semi-final match on Sunday.
