  RIVERS State Police Commissioner Joseph Mukan on Thursday directed that the rape case involving a policeman and a widow be transferred to the state Criminal Investigation Department (SCID). A 23-year-old widow said on Wednesday that she was arrested by policemen at a checkpoint for not wearing a face mask, detained with them for some time, and later taken to a guest house where one of the policemen raped her overnight. CP Mukan on Thursday visited the Sakpenwa police station, where the suspect Inspector Peter Ebah was thought to be attached to, but found out that the mobile policeman was stationed elsewhere. However, Ebah has admitted “sleeping with” the mother of two but on consensual ground, police said. The woman insisted that she was abducted and raped. Spokesman Nnamdi Omoni said, “The matter is still being investigated. The Commissioner of Police has said the matter should be transferred to the State CID for further investigation at the end of which our finding will be made public.
