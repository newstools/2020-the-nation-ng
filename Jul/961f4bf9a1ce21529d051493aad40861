President Muhmmadu Buhari has commended the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker Committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for efforts towards repositioning the party. The President also hailed the Progressive Governors’ Forum (PGF) led by its chairman, Atiku Bagudu, for efforts to participate in the forthcoming governorship elections in Edo and Ondo States. A statement by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, explained Buhari commended Buni for the energy and commitment he deployed into moving across the country to reach out to various factors within the party in pursuit of peace and cohesion. Following dissolution of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the APC in June, the National Executive Committee of the party chose the Yobe Governor and others as chairman and members of the Caretaker Committee as well as of the extraordinary National Convention Committee respectively. At Tuesday’s virtual interaction with Governors of the APC-controlled states with Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo in attendance, the President said that he is pleased with the work the Caretaker Committee has been doing. According to him: “I am pleased with the Chairman and the work of the committee. He is highly mobile in the efforts to coordinate and strengthen the party. I am happy with his personal efforts.” Buhari also appreciated efforts of the APC Governors following the successful conduct of the party primaries in Edo and Ondo States, adding that, “I am happy that they knew their responsibilities as Governors and had identified the right priorities.” Speaking on behalf of his colleagues, Bagudu thanked Buhari for taking the right steps to resolve the crisis in the party.
