Seyitan Babatayo, who accused star musician, Oladapo Oyebanjo, popularly known D’Banj, of rape has withdrawn charges against him. She wrote to the police to drop the case, citing personal reasons. The Police also said it was unable to prove a case of rape and cleared the musician. In a letter dated July 17, 2020 addressed to the Inspector-General of Police through her lawyer, Olamide Omileye, Babatayo  urged the police to also drop investigation of the case. The letter reads: “We hereby officially notify you of our client’s intention to withdraw and discontinue her petition against Mr. Oladapo Daniel Oyebanjo aka D’Banj for personal reasons. “Our client further humbly applies that the investigation and all other action that is currently being carried out by the police with respect to the statement.” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Admin), Umar Sanda, said investigation had discontinued due to lack of evidence. Human rights group, Stand To End Rape Initiative popularly known as STER, said Seyitan decided to end the case without receiving any monetary compensation. STER, which was actively in support of Seyitan’s quest for justice, thanked everyone. It said: “On July 13, 2020, Ms. Babatayo informed STER that a private non-monetary agreement was reached with D’Banj’s team. We, therefore, present this statement as the full account of our stewardship on this matter.” Seyitan accused D’Banj of raping her at Glee Hotel, Victoria Island, Lagos in December 2018, an allegation he has denied several times. D’Banj had sued Seyitan for N1.5bn over the allegation, adding that it had caused him untold embarrassment and psychological trauma.
