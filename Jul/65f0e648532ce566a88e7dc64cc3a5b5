Anyone with evidence of such should kindly avail the public of same. “Documentations relating to contracts execution are not hidden. They are public and therefore, subject to public scrutiny. All road contractors in the State are well known and have nothing to hide. “Mr. Governor therefore, urges all and sundry to ignore the stories coming from those who thrice on falsehood and fabricated stories to take political decisions.”
