 VICTOR Osimhen arrived for talks with Napoli, but his brother-in-law reiterates Italy’s ‘big racism problem’ could ultimately deter the Lille forward. According to Sky Sport Italia and Calciomercato.it, the Nigerian landed in Naples with his girlfriend and representatives. They will meet Partenopei officials later to seemingly negotiate personal terms, but Osita Okolo made it clear non-footballing factors would be considered too. “Napoli’s interest is great, De Laurentiis and the directors really like him,” he told Tuttomercatoweb. “There have already been several rounds of talks, but it’s not true that there’s an agreement. To date, no agreement has been reached with Napoli. “We’ll see what happens with Lille, who still own Osimhen. Victor likes Naples, which is a fantastic city, and he obviously also likes Napoli as a team. The interest of a big Italian team doesn’t surprise me, given how well he did with Lille. If we talk about Serie A, however, many other factors must be considered, such as the issue of racism.” “For, it’s a big problem in Italy and unfortunately it’s widespread. In any case, the final word rests with Victor and no-one else.” In 2019-20, Osimhen netted 13 goals in 27 Ligue 1 games and would reportedly be more interested in a move to the Premier League. Meanwhile, Osimhen has dedicated his Marc Vivien Foe best Ligue 1 African player award for the 2019-20 season to his late father. Osimhen, who lost his father last month at the age of 80,  said as much via his social media while also applauding other nominees.
