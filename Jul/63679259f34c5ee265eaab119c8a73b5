The Murtala Muhammed Airport Terminal Two (MMA 2) re-opened for domestic flights on Wednesday amid poor passengers turn out. As early as 6.00 am, airport workers, airline personnel and security officials were already at their duty posts but only a few passengers showed up at the departure hall. The departure hall remained scanty as the few passengers filed through security and health checks. Airline counters expecting passengers include: Max Air, which scheduled its Lagos / Abuja flight for 7.00 am with flight number VM1640; another flight for 11.20 VM 1644 and its last flight for 15.35 with flight number VM 1642. Information obtained from the flight display terminal at MMA 2 did not give updates whether the flights would proceed on account of poor passenger turnout. Another carrier: Ibom Air, which scheduled its flight flight for 11.00 with flight number Z4300, is not sure to embark on the flight. Staff of DANA Air, who opened counters at MMA 2, said they will not operate any flight. A source hinted that Aero Contractors, which opened their counters also at MMA 2, will not operate any flight. At the General Aviation Terminal (GAT) where Arik Air and Air Peace operate, passengers turnout was more encouraging as the carriers operated flight on the Lagos / Abuja route. Amid tight security and health checks personnel of both carriers were busy attending to passengers. At the GAT, Air Peace opened many counters attending to passengers. Air Peace plans three flights with schedules for 10.30 am; 2.30 pm and 5.30 pm.
