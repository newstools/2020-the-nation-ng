PRESIDENT of the National Union of Road Transport Workers, (NURTW), Alhaji Tajudeen Baruwa has lauded the Federal Government for lifting of the interstate travel restrictions. He said the move will allow his members to return to work without any fear of molestation and harassment. Baruwa in a statement obtained by The Nation, equally appealed for economic stimulus and bailout for the union from the Federal Government to help the sector from a total collapse. He said: “Our union is responsible for conveying 75% of the total number of travelers in the country, necessitating the need for governments’ intervention to boost the capacity of our members to effectively deliver on the high passenger demands, especially at this crucial time when we are expected to be operating at about 50 percent capacity. “I therefore call on the Federal Government to support the Union by providing us with buses to assist in commuting the large number of passengers in the country.” Baruwa also admonished commercial drivers to obey all traveling regulations provided to contain the spread of Covid 19, involving the use of nose cover, social distancing, safe driving and to travel outside the curfew period. He lauded the Federal Ministry of Employment, Labour and Productivity for involving chairmen of the Union as members of the state committees in the planned recruitment of 774,000 Nigerians in the special public works programme of the federal government.
