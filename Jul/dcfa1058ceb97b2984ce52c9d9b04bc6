The Federal Executive Council (FEC) has approved the 2021 to 2023 Medium Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper (MTEF/FSP) with a N12.67 trillion budget projection for each of the years. Minister of State for Budget and National Planning, Clement Agba, who disclosed this to State House Correspondents at a briefing after the eighth virtual FEC meeting at the Presidential Villa in Abuja, also listed other projections for the budget. According to him, other projections came out as $40 per barrel oil benchmark, oil production volume of 1.6 million barrel per day, inflation rate of 11.9 percent, projected gross domestic growth rate of 3 percent and revenue target of N7.50 trillion. Agba also spoke on GDP projection at the end of 2020 fiscal year, disclosing that at the end of 2020, GDP projection is expected to cruise at -4.42 percent and later improve to about -1.8 percent later. According to him, whereas the revenue target for 2020 budget is N5.84 trillion, it is projected to rise to N7.50 trillion in 2021, explaining that even though the projected oil production volume is lower when compared to the earlier projection in 2020 budget as a result of the Organisation of Petroleum Export Countries (OPEC) restriction quota, 63 government-owned enterprises (GOE) have been brought in “to get prices at par.” “On projected revenue for 2021, yes I spoke of the various assumptions that has been made in terms of parameters, and those assumptions are what drive revenues that we get and in terms of how you are able to reflate the economy and spend helps your GDP. “For Nigeria, it was projected that by the end of this year we should have the GDP top at -4.42 percent. However, with the stimulus if properly done and executed, we expect that the GDP will improve to about negative -1.8 percent. So, in terms of the revenue projection, for 2020 it was N5.84 trillion but for 2021 we expect that it will be N7.50 trillion. “Even though the oil production is much lower than our capacity, because we are restricted by the OPEC Plus quota in order to get the prices at par, we have brought in 63 Government Owned Enterprises (GOE). “We are bringing them into the budget order to be able to shore up the budget by additional N2.17 trillion into the budget, hence we are saying we are projecting a larger budget size for 2021 over and above the N10.84 trillion for the revised 2020 budget. “When you look at the N7.5 trillion and the expectations to spend N12 trillion, yes definitely there will be gap and that gap has to be financed. “Is there plan for borrowing payment? Yes there is. Even in the 2020 budget we had provisions to repay debt and in the 2021 projection, there is provision to repay debt. There is a sinking fund, we look at the ratio and ensure that we are able to pay our debts. Of course, that is why we have the debt management office to run those numbers and advise us,” he said.
