GOVERNOR Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s Special Adviser on Education, Tokunbo Phillip Wahab, is one man who shies away from public attention despite his political inclination. Wahab, who also holds the position of a Managing Partner at Wall and Ace legal firm, will readily avoid any reason to be in the spotlight except on occasions when he can’t avoid it. Aside from the obvious that he’s not new to politics – his mother was a strong politician who held sway as women leader for late Chief M. K. O. Abiola’s presidential campaign. He has made a remarkable impact at his duty post, where many had thought he would not be really at home, given his background. Among others he’s instrumental to the online teaching aids for out-of-school students in Lagos State. A brilliant mind and fine gentleman, Wahab can only be spotted in the company of his close allies or his home nestled somewhere on Lagos Island.
