 THE Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has released the provisional list of candidates for the September 19 Edo State governorship election. National Commissioner and Chairman Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, urged the public to go through the nomination forms, affidavits and documents submitted by the parties on behalf of their candidates. He said anyone who “has reasonable grounds to believe that any information in the affidavit or any document submitted by any candidate is false, may file a suit at high court against such a candidate”. He said the particulars of the nominated candidates will be published in the Edo State office of the Commission and simultaneously uploaded on INEC tomorrow.
