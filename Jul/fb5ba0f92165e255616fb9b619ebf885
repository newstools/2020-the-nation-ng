THE Lagos and Osun social circuit is incomplete without the presence of two of Ife princesses, Adesola Ogunwusi – Shoremekun and Adebimpe Ogunwusi-Daudu. The sisters share quite some traits that include but not limited to gaiety and happy demeanours. The sisters to the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, have been regarded as two of the few who continue to light up the social scene with their presence. Interestingly, both Princess Adesola and Princess Adebimpe had been a recurring decimal on the social scene even before the emergence of their brother as the paramount ruler of the Ife kingdom. Another trait which the sisters have become synonymous with is their philanthropy. The twosome are known to have consistently wiped away tears away from the faces of friends and associates in times of need. Another interesting fact about the sisters is their bond. They are mostly seen together and don’t shy away from showering praises on each other – especially on their birthdays and wedding anniversaries.
