 The COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented disruption for the global health and development community. Patients, especially those with underlying health issues that require continuous management, have found their lives complicated by challenges of access, safety, supply chain logistics, and financial stress like never before. The short-term implications of this global challenge are evident everywhere, but the long-term consequences of the pandemic – how it will reshape health services delivery and accessibility in the post COVID-19 world – have started engaging the thoughts and attention of forward-looking service providers. Experts have submitted that the outcry in virtually every country about the lack of equipment and supplies to test for and protect against  COVID-19 will lead countries to re-examine their supply chains for critical health and livelihood related products. For a nation like Nigeria, it was generally expected that this predicted wave of nationalism would catch us on wrong footing, given the fact that we have always lacked most of the required factors to develop a robust innovative and responsive health services delivery model. Wealthy Nigerians have often preferred travelling abroad for medical treatment with the Minister of Health having been quoted as estimating that the country spends over $1 billion annually on medical tourism. Therefore, it is a no-brainer that with the emerging new normal world, a rethink of how healthcare and healthcare resources are accessed even by the comfortable and well-to-do citizens has become necessary. Healthcare services delivery must undergo a transmutation from the physical, brick and mortar format to a more tech-driven approach. Thus, the concept of tech-for-health san borders cannot be dismissed lightly. And Nigeria, now more than ever before, must confront using technology to transform her healthcare delivery system in a way that ensures a win-win for all.
