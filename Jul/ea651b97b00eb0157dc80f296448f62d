The Federal High Court sitting in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, has remanded three foreign nationals and six Nigerians for allegedly aiding and abetting kidnaping, piracy and terrorism. The suspects and employees of Pilgrim Africa Limited were arrested by the Nigerian Navy Ship Pathfinder following the allegations that they paid $200,000 to a gang of pirates, who abducted their colleagues. The suspects, who were arraigned on three-count of conspiracy, and terrorism, reportedly conveyed the kidnap victims to Calabar in Cross River State when they were freed by their abductors. The prosecuting lawyer, Labaram Magaji, relying on section 216 of the Administration of Criminal Justice 2015, prayed the court to strike out the name of the 10th defendant, Pilgrim Africa Limited. Magaji urged the court to commence the trial and remand the suspects in the Correctional Centre, pending the determination of the matter or the bail application filed by the respective defendants.
