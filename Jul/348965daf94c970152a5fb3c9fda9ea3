 PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari has dispatched top security chiefs to interface with stakeholders in Zamfara State on the lingering security challenges in the Northwest. Inspector-General of Police, Muhammad Adamu, said the meeting with stakeholders would review the security situation in the area and adopt strategies to tackle the situation. Adamu made the disclosure when security chiefs visited the Emir of Gusau, Alhaji Ibrahim Bello at his palace in Gusau yesterday. Adamu said that the meeting was part of Federal Government’s efforts in tackling insecurity not only in Zamfara but the Northwest. “We are sent to Gusau today by President Muhammad Buhari as part of his concern on security challenges in Zamfara and Northwest in general,” he said. “Mr President gave us orders to stop the current insecurity in this region. He directed us to come and talk to the stakeholders and identify the remaining challenges that have not been taken care off,” the IGP said. “We need to strategise on addressing banditry, kidnapping and other forms of crimes in this zone. “We hope during the closed-door meeting with stakeholders, we will be able to discuss the remaining challenges.”
