 THE poor organisation of the league coupled with immediate result from his employers may not afford the Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr to toying with the idea of scouting players in the domestic league. Victor Agali who regularly  scout for Rohr said as much in a recent interview with a Lagos-based  local sports radio: “It is disheartening with the level of our local league considering what Nigeria has achieved globally in football. “People must know that the national team is based on results and this is what everybody is looking forward to. Rohr cannot be coaching teams in the league but what he needs to do is to attend matches and pencil down players that he feels can compete with those already in the team. “He cannot just be inviting players that cannot match those already in the team. The organisation of our league is a source of worry ,” Agali said. However, he  said that the U-23 and U-20 teams should be the feeders’ teams for  the Super Eagles just like it obtains in other climes. “The players in the U-23 and U-20 are supposed to be the ones making it to the Super Eagles like what is happening in other nations,” the former Schalke 04 striker said. “But can Rohr trust the reports of coaches from these teams? “Trust is very key and that is why there must be good working relationships with the senior coaches and those in charge of the junior teams. The senior coach must trust the report from the junior coaches,” he added.
