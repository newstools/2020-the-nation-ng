 THE Nigerian Army has said 4,600 patriots recently joined the service to fight terrorists. It said the service is not in short supply of soldiers to fight its battles. In a statement on its verified Facebook page, the Army said a large number among the new recruits “opted to go into Special Forces fighting terrorism”. It debunked reports that 365 soldiers deserted the service for alleged low morale and bad leadership. The statement said those who left service had attained the statutory retirement age. It was learnt that the disengagement is an annual routine where soldiers and officers who have attained the statutory years of retirement are eased out from service and replaced. A source explained that the 365 soldiers will proceed to the Army resettlement centre for a three-month pre-retirement training where they will acquire vocational skills that will equip them for post-service life. Also, troops in the frontline have denied reports of low morale, insisting that they are “well motivated, happy and ready to fight for their fatherland, which is the professional responsibility of the Nigerian Army”. One of the commanders in the frontline, who spoke in confidence, described the report as a distraction. He added: “Our troops are happy and willing to fight. I have soldiers here with me and we fight day and night.”
