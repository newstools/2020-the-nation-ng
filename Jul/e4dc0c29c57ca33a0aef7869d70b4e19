Hoodlums have attacked a police station in Orogun community, Ughelli North Local Government Area, removing an AK-47 rifle and 30 rounds ammunition. The Nation gathered that the police have embarked on a house-to-house search in the community to recover the weapon. A source, who spoke to The Nation, said the police had attempted to arrest a suspect but his mother aided his escape. The woman was arrested and detained at the station but her son and others stormed the station, threatening to deal with the officers. A police source said, “The constable and inspector had gone to arrest a suspect, but the suspect’s mother locked up him and he escaped arrest. The mother was arrested and taken to the station. The other children mobilised to the station and threatened to deal with the police for arresting their mother.” “In the night, the constable was alone in the station sleeping after the inspector and criminal record officer had gone home when the hoodlums pounced and took away his weapon after beating him to stupor”. Police spokesman DSP Onome Onowakpoyeya promised to get details of the incident but was yet to do so at press time.
