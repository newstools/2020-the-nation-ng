A child-centred educational app, Bright Minds, has been unveiled on Google play store. Bright Minds (an Indomie Fan Club initiative) offers a curated collection of kid-friendly subjects and games. National Coordinator Mrs. Faith Joshua said: “The app is available on iPhone, iPad, and Android phones..” Mrs. Joshua said members would need a pass code to access the app. “When you launch Bright Minds, you can filter the app selections by recommended ages, classes, subject matter (e.g. mathematics, vocational aptitude, art, social studies, general science, etc.).”
