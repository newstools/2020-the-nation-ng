There is tension in Ekiti State as Governor Kayode Fayemi was confirmed positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) on Wednesday. Fayemi tested positive following the third clinical test carried out on him. The Governor made the announcement via his official twitter handle @kfayemi, saying he had gone into self- isolation. He delegated critical tasks to his Deputy, Otunba Bisi Egbeyemi, adding he would, henceforth perform routine duties from home. The Chairman of Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) tweeted: “I took my third Covid-19 test yesterday and it came back positive. “I’m generally ok and I’m already self isolating at home and receiving the best of care from my medical team. “I’m delegating critical tasks to my Deputy but will continue routine duty from home”. Confirming the development, the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr Yinka Oyebode, said his principal has proceeded on self-isolation. He disclosed the Governor’s wife, Erelu Bisi Fayemi and all the Governor’s personal aides have gone for COVID- 19 tests. “The wife of the governor, Erelu Bisi Fayemi being the closest to the governor and members of the State Executive Council , including myself as well as personal aides of His Excellency have submitted ourselves for Covid 19 tests. “Samples have been taken and we are now expecting the results. But none of us is symptomatic as of now, so no cause for alarm,” Oyebode said. An impeccable source close to the Governor told The Nation no fewer than 10 immediate aides have been placed on compulsory self-isolation for a minimum of 14 days following contact with their principal. The source said there was tension among the Governor’s aides, expressing fears they could also have contracted the virus because of having close contact with him.
