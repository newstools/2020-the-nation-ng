A Senior Advocate of Nigeria, SAN, Kpajie Ibegbu has called for full enforcement of the life jail terms recently prescribed by the National Assembly for rapists. He described any human engaging in rape as worse than an animal, saying that the life jail term would go a long way to separating culprits from the society for life. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday in Onitsha, Ibegbu maintained that rape was one of the worst crimes any one could commit, describing it as complete wickedness, man’s inhumanity to fellow man, sheer madness, unnatural and heinous. He said, “Any rapist is worse than an animal because animals do not engage in rape or use of force to have a sexual relationship with opposite sex or even same sex, rather, they make advances like humans do, as expected. “It is abominable and a shame for a father to have canal knowledge with his own daughter”. Ibegbu regretted the lack of autonomy of the judiciary, stressing that the judiciary should not be going cap-in-hand with what belongs to them. “The judicial officers should be properly taken care of so as to stop the syndrome of he who pays the piper dictates the tune. My late father, as a Chief Magistrate, lived in a palatial home with adequate remunerations. “Judicial officers need better cars, houses, medical check-up and holidays, as applicable in those colonial days, so that they will not be tempted to deviate,” he added.
