Imo State Governor, Sen. Hope Uzodinma, yesterday described President Muhammadu Buhari as a stabilising force who has used his honest leadership and visionary economic policies to stabilise the country and create a promising, sustainable self-reliant economy at a most trying time in the country. The governor submitted that the President’s honest management of resources and selflessness has helped in no small way in stabilising the polity  and in refocusing the economy on the part of recovery and self-reliance, adding that but for the President’s manifest honest leadership and relentless onslaught against corruption, the country would have long gone under. He said the president’s determined confrontation of the security challenges, the fight against corruption and his economic policies have brought stability to Nigeria. Uzodinma, who was speaking to a delegation of Coalition of Ethnic Nationality Youth Leaders of Nigeria, led by its chairman, Mohamadu Salihu Danlami, in his office in Owerri yesterday said it was convenient for people to rail on the heightened insecurity situation in the country, forgetting that there was a time Boko Haram was occupying more than 24 LGAs in the country. He noted that as a war commander, Buhari has brought his experience to bear on the onslaught against terrorists, bandits and other criminal elements. He said unlike in the past when the military were ill equipped, the president has strengthened the security appartick with the necessary weapons to defend the country. He said the president’s regular interaction with security chiefs showed that he is personally interested in how they carry out their assignments. On the economy, Uzodinma said the recent World Bank report giving Nigerian economy a pass mark in growth has confirmed that the government’s economic policies were yielding results.
