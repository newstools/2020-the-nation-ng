 AJIA Hasana Garuba, wife of the late Speaker of Edo State House of Assembly, Zakawanu Garuba, was on Monday released by her abductors. She was kidnapped along Okene-Abuja Expressway three days ago on her way to Auchi, her husbandâ€™s hometown, for his burial. A source said the kidnappers demanded about N20m but it was not clear how much was paid for her release. Zakawanu Garuba, a stalwart of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state, died in Abuja after a brief illness.
