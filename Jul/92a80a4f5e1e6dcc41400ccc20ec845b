President Muhammadu Buhari has warned political appointees and other government officials against using their positions to bestow undue advantage on anyone seeking government jobs and other favours. Minister of Information and Culture Alhaji Lai Mohammed, who announced this in a statement, quoted the president as saying the action is “antithetical to the character of the administration”. Mohammed said the president’s repeated warning followed persistent reports of fraudsters using the business cards and purported referral letters from presidential aides and other government officials to solicit employment, contract and other favours. He said ministries, departments and agencies should disregard any purported request from government officials with the intention of conferring undue advantage on anyone seeking such favours. Mohammed said the administration had put in place a systematic and disciplined approach to ensure that the government runs smoothly for all Nigerians, whether in the area of employment or contract procurement. “This system should be allowed to work for all Nigerians without interference,” Mohammed said.
