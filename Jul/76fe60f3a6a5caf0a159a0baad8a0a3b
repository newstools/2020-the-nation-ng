 Ini Edo has urged filmmakers to produce more movies that preach against drug abuse. The actress recently made the remark at the virtual MTN ASAP’s Drug Convos, in commemorating International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking. Edo stressed that there is a need to use movies to show the adverse effects of drug abuse. “The National Film and Video Censors Board has a huge role to play in this. If you are telling a drug-related success story, there has to be a certain result that shows that if you get into this type of lifestyle, this is what you are likely to get at the end of the day.” Edo admitted that what many young people see in films is the good side of drug abuse, saying, “they may be thinking, ‘oh, I need to be high to perform which is probably what they see on TV and on social media but they don’t get to see the adverse effect of abusing drugs and how damaging it can be on young people.” Joining Edo on the need to educate more people on the adverse effects of drug abuse, Chairman, MTN Foundation, Prince Julius Adelusi-Adeluyi reiterated the need for collaboration in the fight against substance abuse. “Through the Anti-Substance Abuse Programme (ASAP), the MTN Foundation hopes to communicate the urgency required to tackle the growing menace of drug abuse in our society. Our aim is to create a drug-free Nigeria in collaboration with relevant stakeholders. We are happy that various guilds, organisations, and active centres have come together to support this cause.” “It is our duty to build a healthier and cleaner community for Nigerians and this can only be done through an alliance against drug abuse.”
