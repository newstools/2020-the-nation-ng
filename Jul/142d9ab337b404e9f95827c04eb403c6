The Nigerian Army Corps of Engineers on Sunday commissioned several projects at the Army Barracks in Epe. The projects commissioned include the Officers Mess, Married Officers Quarters, Parade Ground, 985m Fence, 3 x storehouses, Magazine, Armoury, the official residence of the Commandant NASFA, 1.8 km Road, 19 x CBQs, the Corporal and Below Club among others. Representing the Chief of Army Staff, Lt-Gen Tukur Buratai, Major General John Malu said that the recent expansion of the Army from 5 Divisions to 8 Divisions structure with several commands coming up that there was need to reoccupy those barracks that were closed down. Consequent upon this, the COAS directed that the undeveloped portions of the Epe Barracks be reoccupied, adding that the directive was premised on two vital exigencies. The first was the need to establish military presence in the general area of Epe, so as to beef up security, and the second was the need to relocate some units and formations affected by the expansion of a railway project around Yaba, being undertaken by the present administration, to improve the national transportation system. “As we commission the reconstructed Epe Barracks today, I deem it necessary to take a look back at history. The NA acquired this land in 1970 and it was gazetted in the same year. Acquisition of additional acreage over the next five years brought the total land area to 440 hectares by 1975. Part of the land was developed into a barrack while a large portion was left for training and future development,” he said.
