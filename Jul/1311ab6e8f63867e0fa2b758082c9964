 France World Cup winner, Antoine Griezmann has suffered a muscle injury and could miss the remainder of their La Liga campaign, his club Barcelona have confirmed.
The 29-year-old forward started for Quique Setien’s team as they beat Real Valladolid 1-0 on Saturday, but he had to be replaced at half-time, with Luis Suarez coming on to partner Lionel Messi up front. Setien confirmed after the game that the France international had asked to come off because he was feeling some discomfort after the first half. “Tests this morning have shown that first-team player Antoine Griezmann has a muscle injury in the quadriceps of his right leg,” a statement on the club’s website confirmed. “He is therefore not available for selection at the present time and the evolution of the injury will condition his availability.”  Griezmann will at least be unavailable for Thursday’s match against Osasuna, but will likely miss the final clash with Deportivo Alaves on July 19. Griezmann, who joined the Camp Nou outfit from Atletico Madrid last summer, has scored nine goals in 35 appearances in La Liga this term. The attacker’s injury will likely see Suarez return to the starting XI for the last two matches, as Setien confirmed on Saturday that he was just being rested after playing five games in a row. The Catalan side are second in the Spanish top-flight and trail leaders Real Madrid by one point. Barca will then turn their attention to their Champions League campaign, which resumes on August 8 when they face Napoli in the second leg of their last-16 tie. The two sides drew 1-1 in the first match in Italy in Febraury before the competition was suspended because of the coronavirus pandemic.
