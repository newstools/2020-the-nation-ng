Boxing in Nigeria is set to receive a huge boost following the completion of an international standard boxing facility, the Mojisola Ogunsanya Memorial/GOtv Boxing Gym, which is expected to be commissioned soon. Located in a serene location in Lagos, the boxing gym is the brainchild of Adewunmi Ogunsanya, Chairman, MultiChoice Nigeria and GOtv Boxing. The multimillion-naira gym, funded by Ogunsanya, is conceived as a pre-bout preparation facility for local and international boxers coming to fight in Nigeria as well as an academy for nurturing young and promising boxers to stardom. The facility, which has a hostel to accommodate 30 boxers at a time and located in an expansive compound, is fitted with modern training equipment such as a standard ring, thread mills, punching and speed bags, double-end bags, wrecking ball snatchers, sparring mitts, focus mitts and bar bells among others. Giving reasons for setting up the gym, Ogunsanya said it is a continuation of the efforts, which began in 2014, at reviving the sport in Nigeria: “We are happy about the progress Nigerian boxing has made since the intervention through GOtv Boxing Night began in 2014. “We have talented boxers, who are disadvantaged by the inadequacy of training facilities and proper grooming. We believe that this gym will go a long way in addressing that challenge and help to bring our boxers to par with their colleagues abroad,” Ogunsanya said. Jenkins Alumona, CEO, Flykite Productions, organisers of GOtv Boxing Night, commended Ogunsanya for his commitment to the growth of Nigerian boxing.
