Zinedine Zidane has the opportunity to fulfil the objective that he laid out for his Real Madrid team when he returned as coach on March 12, 2019. The French coach outlined his ambitions straight away last year. “Next season our priority will be to win the league,” he said.”I can’t say that we’ll definitely win it, but we’ll compete right until the end. “He had the same message for everyone he spoke to, whether it was the press, people at the club or the players. He has already achieved his first goal, which was to make sure that Real Madrid end their habit of dropping out of the title race too early. The club were successful under Zidane two years ago, winning the Champions League against Liverpool in Kiev, but Zidane saw it as somewhat of a failure as the club finished the league campaign in third place and some 17 points adrift of Barcelona. It’s for this reason that his complete focus has been on winning the league title this season. A major reason why Real Madrid maintained their title challenge has been how solid they’ve been this season. Zidane put importance on not having too much rotation and his team maybe lost some flair, but they’ve been more consistent and more of a reliable unit, one capable of maintaining defensive discipline. In the two LaLiga seasons that Zidane has completed, Los Blancos conceded 41 and 44 goals, but with two matches left this year his squad have only conceded 21 at the moment, with 19 clean sheets. Zidane knows exactly what the Champions League means to this club, but he also knows that winning the league helps to build strong teams and this has been his message throughout, especially since lockdown.
