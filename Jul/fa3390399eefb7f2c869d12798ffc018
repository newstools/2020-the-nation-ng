Rotherham United winger Chiedozie Ogbene has expressed his desire to represent the Republic of Ireland at international level. The FAI have begun the paperwork on the eligibility process for 23-year-old Ogbene who was born in Lagos, Nigeria, but moved to Cork aged seven with his family in 2005. He played schoolboy football in Cork with College Corinthians, Kilreen Celtic, Tramore Athletic and Everton before he was signed by Cork City in 2015 and then moved to Limerick in January 2017. After a move to England and Brentford in 2018, Ogbene spent a season on loan with Exeter City before a transfer to Rotherham in August 2019. A mainstay of Rotherhamâ€™s successful push for promotion in the season just ended, Ogbene was an ever present for the Millers in the shortened campaign and scored one goal as they finished runners-up in League One. He has made international manager Stephen Kenny aware of his desire to play for the Boys in Green.
