 A PRO-GOVERNOR Godwin Obaseki’s civil society group, the Concerned Citizens of Edo State, has asked the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, to list his achievements while he was the Secretary to Edo State Government (SSG) and Chief of Staff. The group, yesterday in Benin, in a statement by its Secretary, Orobosa Igbinoba, noted that it was confident that President Muhammadu Buhari, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the security agencies would rise to the occasion to protect the wishes of Edo people on September 19. It said: “The nation has enough challenges at the moment. President Buhari will not allow the prevailing peace in Edo State to be punctured, because of the ambition of an unpopular candidate, knowing the regional and possible nationwide crises that can follow. “Pastor Ize-Iyamu knows that his party, the APC, does not have the latitude to win elections in Edo State. Instead of withdrawing from the race to save Edo people the troubles and the needless investment by their sponsors, they are relying on Abuja’s backing.” Ize-Iyamu, through the Director of Communication and Media of his campaign organisation, Prince John Mayaki, said the non-existent group was the creation of Obaseki’s Special Adviser on Media and Communication Strategy, Crusoe Osagie.
