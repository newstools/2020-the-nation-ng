On a recent episode of Royal Blue: The Everton FC Podcast, Liverpool Echo head of sport David Prentice has expressed his frustrations with Everton forward, Alex Iwobi. Since moving to Everton from Arsenal in a £27.36-million deal last summer, Iwobi has gone on to make 22 Premier League appearances for the Toffees, scoring just one goal and providing no assists, as well as averaging a disappointing WhoScored match rating of 6.61 – ranking him as Everton’s joint-12th-best player so far this season, prior to the club’s fixture against Southampton. In a recent fixture of Everton’s – a particularly lifeless 1-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur – Iwobi once again failed to inspire for the Toffees – having no shots and completing no dribbles of the ball, culminating in a 5.85 match rating. On the subject of the 24-year-old, David Prentice lambasted Iwobi on the Royal Blue podcast, suggesting that the former Arsenal man is “overpriced” as well as “enormously” frustrating. He said: “Alex Iwobi frustrates me enormously. I have big rows with my son about it because he’s somebody that, should we politely say, fails to see any good in his game. “Certainly, that performance against Leicester and the defensive display against Liverpool, you could sort of see why being he’d been recruited.”
