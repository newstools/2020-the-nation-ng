As Nigerian Muslims get set to join the rest of the world to celebrate the Eid-El-Kabir, President National Union of Road Workers (NURTW) Alhaji Ibikunle Tajudeen Baruwa, has urged his members to shun drink driving throughout the period of the festivity. Observing that people always tend to drop their guards during festivities, Baruwa said any driver out for business must drive responsibly, noting that the road is a shared asset. Baruwa in a goodwill message to members of the union said this year’s celebration calls for sober reflection in view of the deadly Coronavirus pandemic spreading across the world. He said drivers as responsible members of the society must drive responsibly, urging them not to drink and drive, or drive under the influence of alcohol or any other drugs. He said, “I appreciate the goodness and mercies of Allah over Nigeria and especially upon all Muslim faithful, for keeping us alive to see another Eid-el-Kabir celebration amidst the COVID-19 pandemic that has claimed many lives.” Baruwa calls for sober reflection from Nigerians, asking them to reflect on the lifestyle of prophet Ibrahim who lived sacrificially giving alms generously to the needy and worshiped God with total dedication. “Let us continue to seek the face of Allah and to relate in holiness, love, peace, personal sacrifice, moderation, piousness and self-discipline exhibited by both the prophet and prophet Mohammed, (SAW)”. He admonished commercial drivers of the union, to obey traffic regulations, maintain social distancing, enforce the use of nose masks by passengers and to be good ambassadors of the union in all places. He advised members to strictly obey the FRSC, Police, and other traffic managers on duty throughout the festive period. “If you drink do not drive, if you drive do not drink,” Baruwa advised.
