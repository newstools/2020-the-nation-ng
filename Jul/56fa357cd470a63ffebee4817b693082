 Comedian and actor, Justice ‘Ushbebe’ Nuagbe, has featured Eniola Badmus and AY Makun in a new television series, ‘Abnormal’. Though the comic actor is yet to announce the kick-off date, he explained that the series relates to the everyday life of people and could easily be understood by every age level. Ushbebe further revealed that the new comedy series tells the story of a character known as Ush, who was given free accommodation in Lekki but could not meet up with demands and decided to invite his best friend, Tomama, from Warri to join in the mission to overcome the many challenges of the Lagos living. Created by Ushbebe and produced by Pride Rock entertainment and Ocean growth homes, the hilarious sitcom is directed by Darasen Richard. Also featured on the series are IK Ogbonna, Juliet Ibrahim, Osita Iheme, Lilian Esoro, and MC Lively amongst others. This is coming a year after the release of Akpe: The Return of the beast by Ushbebe.
