 Barcelona have played eight games in 25 days after the enforced break and Lionel Messi hasnâ€™t missed a single minute since the return of LaLiga Santander. The Argentine played the full 90 minutes, including time added on, in the games against Real Mallorca, Leganes, Sevilla, Athletic Club, Celta Vigo, Atletico Madrid, Villarreal and Espanyol. His contribution to the team is of great importance, especially after the break, as Barcelona have struggled and have lost ground in the LaLiga Santander title race. No other outfielder has spent so much time on the pitch as Messi and only Marc-Andre ter Stegen have managed to play all the games after football got back underway. Gerard Pique is another player who has started all eight matches but was replaced in the games against Leganes and Villarreal. There are three games to go until the season comes to an end and Barcelona will be called to face Real Valladolid, Osasuna and Alaves. Then, they will get more than two weeks of rest before competing for their main objective this season, which is the Champions League trophy.
