Mrs Kafila Ogunsina, a mother of four, on Thursday, prayed an Ile-tuntun Customary Court in Ibadan, to dissolve her 12-year marriage to Rafiu, on the grounds that he was slowing her “economic breakthrough”. Kafilat, a seamstress, told the court that she had not made any financial headway since she married Rafiu,12 years ago. “Ever since I stepped into Rafiu’s house as a wife, nothing has worked for me. I have remained stagnant; moreover, he beats me like a slave. “Rafiu also destroyed the little property I took into his house,” Kafilat explained. Giving evidence before the court, Rafiu, however, opposed the dissolution of the marriage, but did not deny the allegations leveled against him. Rafiu, a bricklayer, simply asked the court to help him plead with his wife not to abandon him. “Please my lord, don’t separate us. She is my life, she is a good homemaker. “I might never be able to get anyone like her,” Rafiu said. The President of the court, Chief Henry Agbaje, advised the petitioner to exercise more patience. Agbaje directed the embattled couple to produce their relatives in court at the next sitting and adjourned the case until Aug. 13 for judgment. (NAN)
