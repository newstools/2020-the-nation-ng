  SHAREHOLDERS of Nigerian Aviation Handling Company (NAHCO) Plc on Thursday approved the distribution of N487 million as cash dividends for the 2019 business year. The dividend payment came as the company grew its profit before tax by 166 per cent to N1.34 billion in 2019. Shareholders will receive a dividend per share of 30 kobo. Chairman, Nigerian Aviation Handling Company (NAHCO) Plc, Dr. Seinde Fadeni, said the company’s pre-tax profit rose from N503.237 million in 2018 to N1.34 billion in 2019, a growth that was due to several measures put in place during the financial year to control costs and income revenue by the company. According to him, profit after tax increased significantly from N196.8 million in 2018 to N717.2 million in 2019, representing 264 per cent increase within the period. The group closed the year ended December 31, 2019 with total revenue of about N9.99 billion, a marginal increase of 2.3 per cent over the 2018 figures of about N9.8 billion. Fadeni spoke on Thursday at the annual general meeting (AGM) in Lagos, which was transmitted virtually to shareholders in compliance with the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Presidential Taskforce (PTF) on COVID-19 pandemic. Fadeni  noted that the 2019 business year would have ended on a better note, but the United States – China trade issues and the virus in the Asian country affected importation and reduced flight frequencies at the tail end of 2019.
