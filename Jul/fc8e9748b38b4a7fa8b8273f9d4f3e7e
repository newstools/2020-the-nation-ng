The Lagos State Government, through the Lagos State Health Management Agency (LASHMA), has welcomed its first public servant baby under the Lagos State Health Scheme (LSHS). The baby girl was born through Cesarean section by one Aminat Oluwatobi Ademiluyi at Blue Cross Hospital, Lagos. Speaking at the baby’s debut, the Acting General Manager of LASHMA, Dr Emmanuella Zamba, described the event as double celebrations since the birth of the baby coincided with public service day anniversary. “On behalf of Mr. Governor, we are glad to welcome our first public servant baby. We got the good news yesterday that we deliver our first baby under the Lagos Health Scheme. Incidentally, it was also the public service day celebration. It is really a remarkable day for us,” she said. She further stressed that the state health insurance scheme is affordable while urging the general public to also utilise the advantage to access quality healthcare services. “The state government is subsidising the payment for civil servant and it is also open for the general public. It is costs N8,500 for a year. The family is expected to pay a premium N40, 000 yearly, that is N3,333 monthly and the single premium is N8,500 per annum.” While expressing his gratitude, the new baby’s father, Ademiluyi Adebowale, a physically impaired civil servant who is an officer at Lagos State Office for Disability Affairs, described the schemed as a rare privilege. “I know what it would have cost me as an individual to have my wife through this C-section operation in the private hospital but with the (LSHIS), it’s absolutely coming with nothing. I’m full of appreciation to the Lagos State government.”
