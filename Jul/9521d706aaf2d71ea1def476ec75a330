Nigeria is the only African country that will present a large contingent in the table tennis event of the Tokyo 2021 Paralympic Games after Isau Ogunkunle and Faith Obiora are confirmed among the players that qualified based on their world ranking by the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF). From the 2019 African Championships held in Egypt which served as the continental qualifiers, five Nigerians picked their tickets after emerging champions in their various classes to secure the automatic tickets to Tokyo. They are Tajudeen Agunbiade (M9), Olufemi Alabi (M10), Ahmed Koleosho (M3), Victor Farinloye (M8) and Faith Obazuaye (10). In a statement signed by ITTF Para Table Tennis Events and Classification Manager, Pablo Perez, Nigeria was listed among the 40 countries expected to compete in the table tennis event of the Paralympic Games. It would be recalled that Ogunkunle and Obiora finished second in Egypt to miss out from the automatic qualification but their world ranking secured the slots for them after consideration by ITTF. Ogunkunle who is the national champion will be making his debut at the Paralympic Games in the men’s class four while Obiora who is making her second appearance at the Paralympic Games will be competing in the women’s class five.
