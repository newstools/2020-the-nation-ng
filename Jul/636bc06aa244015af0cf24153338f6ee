Prof. Chris Onalo, founding Registrar/Chief Executive, Institute of Credit Administration (ICA) owes the view and very strongly too that but for the interference of the various tiers of government, the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) has what it takes to fully recover its debts. He spoke with Ibrahim Apekhade Yusuf. Excerpts: MCON management has hinted of plans to sell its over N5 trillion debt stock owed by a few Nigerians to the taxpayers, a development analysts find alarming. Do you share this sentiment? Well, one can understand the frustration faced by AMCON. Here you have got the enabling instrument to fast track the debt recovery operation, for which the bill or the AMCON law was enacted. But it seems to be failing. There is a massive frustration. So in the new thinking, perhaps, the management of AMCON, is trying to come up with by suggesting that the N5 trillion that a few Nigerians are owing through borrowing from banks should be recovered from all Nigerians. Perhaps, what the management of AMCON meant is that in one way or the other, Nigerians generally will suffer for the sin of a few people that they have committed and that sin is, borrowing money from commercial banks under serious circumstances and failing to pay back that money spells doom for the economy. And because of the colossal nature, I mean, the amount is quite staggering, you are talking of over N5trillion. It will definitely impact negatively on Nigerians. To that extent, the comment by the CEO of AMCON, in respect of which you have quoted, could be asserted. However, we at the Institute of Credit Administration (ICA), national body related to matters of credit management adjudication, believe that the issue of AMCON’s debts; debts owed by few Nigerians that AMCON is empowered by law to collect and unfortunately, AMCON is not able to collect or strike a critical balance because of known circumstances, peculiar to our kind of operating environment in this country, we still would want to suggest way out as an institute. First and foremost, the ICA is positing that the powers that be, should back out of influencing the process of recovering the debts. AMCON should be left alone to do its job, for which the law has mandated it to do. Nobody should provide cover to those few corporate institutions and private individuals in Nigeria who borrowed money from banks with or without intention to pay back those loan facilities. Thus resulting in the situation we have today, which has significantly, if not profoundly impacted the economy of this country which is affecting everyone. The godfatherism should stop. Top level government officials should stop providing cover for those who have put the banking system in a mess like this. The judiciary should stop playing hide and seek game on this matter. The judicial system is not encouraging the growth and development of Nigeria’s economy. And it looks like the judiciary authority is behaving like it is not a part of government. Judicial authorities should also realise that their children are Nigerians and the children and they themselves have limited time to live on earth. Therefore, they should do nothing to mess up the country. Criminal conducts and activities must be met with the full weight of the law. The judicial system should not create any avenue for escape or prolong the process to obtain justice. It is typical of debtors, whether individual or corporate debtors to find a way to frustrate the efforts of creditors to recover their money from them. We have seen a situation where rather than the debtor assisting the creditor to recover the money; the debtor now begins to chase the creditor away from asking for his money. That is an aberration. No economy or system survives under that ridiculous atmosphere. The judges, lawyers, should stop providing cover for high profile debtors. There shouldn’t be a hiding place for debtors. How would you assess the role of the CBN in the debt recovery process thus far? The CBN is in a way culpable for not meeting and supervising banks with appropriate supervision instruments that deliver sanctions in cases of breach. Going to the origin of those debts, where was the CBN, when banks were giving out loans under spurious circumstances? Was the CBN not supervising them at that time? These are questions. As you are aware, the banks usually carry out due diligence checks before loans are issued. Do you think this protocol is being breached? Some of these high profile debtors, because they planned to take the money and never to repay, avoided documentary evidence and made commitments that would stand as documentary evidence.   In some cases, there were no proper disclosures. Just by mere political intervention, some of them got large chunks of loans from the banks. It is quite unfortunate that we are facing this kind of challenge today. In a credit based economy, these are some of the infrastructure the system puts in placer to strengthen credit economy, operations so that the national character can now be formed, which means that if you enter into a commitment, either in writing or by your word, that commitment is sacrosanct because if you fail to honour that obligation or keep to that commitment, you risky your reputation and your integrity will go down. And so, the government should make it possible for AMCON to collaborate with capacity building institutions like the ICA, the judiciary, the legislature, etc., in order to deliver a healthy credit economy environment for this country. Without extending loan facilities, trade credit facilities, consumer credit facilities to the citizenry, the economy can never be any better.
