Liverpool failed to win a Premier League game at Anfield for the first time since January 2019 as Burnley ended a run of 24 straight victories for Jurgen Klopp’s men on home soil thanks to Jay Rodriguez’s strike in a 1-1 draw on Saturday. Andy Robertson’s first-half header had the champions on course to maintain their perfect home record and close in on a record points tally for the English top flight. But Liverpool were made to pay for a host of missed chances when Rodriguez’s fine finish earned a point to further Burnley’s late push for a place in Europe next season. It could even have been three for the visitors as Johann Berg Gudmundsson hit the bar late on. Liverpool can still break Manchester City’s record points haul of 100 two seasons ago, but will now need to win all three of their remaining matches. Klopp has insisted he is not looking to rewrite the record books, but there was no sign of the German easing up with a first title in 30 years long since won.
