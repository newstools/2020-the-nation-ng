Some 602 repentant Boko Haram members on Monday denounced their membership of the group and swore an oath of allegiance to the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The ex-insurgents who have completed a de-radicalisation, rehabilitation and reintegration programme, denounced their membership of  the insurgent group at the Malam Sidi Camp in Kwami Local Government area of Gombe State.

Speaking during the exercise, Maj.-Gen. Bamidele Shafa, the Coordinator, Operation Safe Corridor, said, “The panel is for the clients to appear before it to confess their past and denounce their membership of Boko Haram and Islamic State’s West Africa Province (ISWAP) and swear Oath of Allegiance to be loyal, disciplined and obedient citizens of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and then make commitments. “The commitment is that at the end of the programme, where they commit any offence, they stand to forfeit all privileges that they have acquired today and will be liable to have committed an offence against the State.”
