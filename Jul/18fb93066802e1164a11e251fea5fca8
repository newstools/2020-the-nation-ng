Lionel Messi will “end his working and footballing life at Barcelona”, the club’s president has said. Josep Maria Bartomeu dismissed reports the Argentina international, 33, was unwilling to renew his current contract when it expires in 2021. “We are negotiating with many players but Messi has explained to us he wants to stay,” Bartomeu told Spanish network Movistar. “And so we’re going to enjoy him for much longer.”
