 THE National Chairman of the National Rescue Movement (NRM), Senator Saidu Dansadau, has said his party will rescue Edo State from political captors on September 19. He noted that for government’s businesses to be conducted in a transparent and honest manner, good people were needed to be at the helm. Dansadau spoke at the Edo State secretariat of the party in Benin while inaugurating the campaign council and unveiling NRM manifesto. NRM is one of the 14 parties that will participate in the September 19 governorship election. Dansadau, represented by the National Administrative Secretary, Mohammed Isah, said: “I plead with us, great Edolites, be wise and take your destinies in your hands. “Edo State has been in the news for the wrong reasons. Those who brought us pains, ridicule and shame are here again to deceitfully lure us into voting them to power. Their actions have always put our lives in jeopardy.”
