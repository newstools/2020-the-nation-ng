 Super Eagles striker Paul Onuachu has tested positive for coronavirus, according to his Belgian club Genk. But his club mates and compatriots Stephen Odey and Cyril Dessers tested negative. The 26-year-old striker is the only positive case in the club. “In the run-up to the first exhibition game of the season, the entire Genk group was tested yesterday (Tuesday). Everyone tested negative except Onuachu,” a report on Belgian website hln.be stated. The 6ft7in striker left Belgium for Nigeria on May 27, alongside fellow Eagles strikers Victor Osimhen and Imoh Ezekiel. He returned to his club June 28 after he was stranded for a week in Lagos due to travel restrictions caused by the coronavirus pandemic. According to hln.be, Onuachu will miss Genk’s first exhibition game of the season against Eendracht Termien on Thursday as he will be quarantined for a week. Onuachu’s COVID-19 status has however raised concerns within the Genk squad as he had trained intensively with the rest of the squad for more than a week now. Onuachu joined Genk from Danish club FC Midtjylland last summer and scored 10 goals for the club before the Belgian Pro Division season was ended abruptly due to COVID-19.
