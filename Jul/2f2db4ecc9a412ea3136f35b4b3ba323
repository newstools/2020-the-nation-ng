The Niger State Command of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has said 690 officers and men will be deployed across the state to ensure motorists’ safety during the Eid-El-Kabir celebration. It said it would mobilise 320 special marshals, 20 functional patrol vehicles, three ambulances and one heavy-duty tow truck throughout the state. Corps spokesman Raji Habibu Egigogo, who spoke to The Nation in Minna, said this is to ensure hitch-free traffic flow and enforcement of traffic rules and regulations, in addition to enforcement of COVID-19 protocols set by the government. “The corps is advising Nigerites, especially motorists, to observe safety precautions while using the road, abide by the COVID-19 protocol of physical distancing in their vehicles and use face masks as they celebrate Eid-El-Kabir,” he said. Egigogo added that the corps would be visible on the highways to ensure enforcement against overloading and physical distancing among the commuters and respond to distress calls that might arise. “The command wishes the citizens a hitch-free Eid-El-Kabir celebration. As we celebrate, we need to remember that only the living celebrates.”
