Gunmen on Wednesday morning attacked the Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Lokoja, Kogi State, carting away computers and other sensitive materials from the administrative department of the health institution. The gunmen who stormed the place in large numbers carted away laptops and phones of staffers and patients. The were alleged to have carted away vital documents. They operated for about thirty minutes and left the scene with victims crying for help. All efforts to get the response of the Kogi State Police Command proved abortive as at the time of filing this report. There has been no love lost between the management of the FMC Lokoja and the Kogi State government over perceived differences on the latterâ€™s stance on the COVID-19 pandemic. While the state governor Alhaji Yahaya Bello has continued to hold on to the view that the Coronavirus disease remains a hoax, personnel at the medical centre appear not to be on the same page with him.
