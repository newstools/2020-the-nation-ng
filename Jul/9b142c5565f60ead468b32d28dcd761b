 Life, they say, begins at 40 and suave looking personality, Tunde Alade, has seemingly kicked off a new beginning as he joins the league of quadragenarian. If you have come in contact with the cosmopolitan Alade, popularly known as ‘Tunde Dynamix’, you would attest to his humility. Despite his wealth of experience and value, he has maintained to remain humble. Aside from treating everybody like his own family, Alade has become an unbothered jolly good fellow who loves to live life to the fullest. The head honcho of Dynamix Communication is a happy man as he glides into the 40 leagues on July 8. Ever since his breakthrough as the best campus magazine publisher, Youth influencer, award organizer, brand/event manager and now a property investor, Tunde has remained consistent keeping his heads up high. At a point when most of his age peers are lavishing proceeds from their business and living in grand opulence, Tunde invested wisely by sowing in tears and currently reaping bountifully in smile. For the Chemical Engineering graduate of the University of Lagos, hitting the milestone of Age 40 is a rare opportunity which he has always watched out for. He has always wanted to throw a big class party to thank his creator for preserving his life. Due to the current pandemic, all plans were suspended till next year. His wife and kids hosted his close few friends to a dinner at his Magodo residence where they all celebrated his achievements and life.
