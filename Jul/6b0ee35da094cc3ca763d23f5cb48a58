 THE MultiChoice Group has joined the United Nations (UN) as an official supporter of the UN’s global COVID-19 awareness campaign known as Pause. Launched globally on 30 June, the Pause campaign aims to highlight the dangers of sharing false information related to COVID-19. It asks people around the world to pause, think and take care before sharing information which could be inaccurate or a result of misinformation and may have harmful effects. “We are very excited to have MultiChoice onboard as a supporter giving the launch of our campaign reach across Africa. “They are uniquely positioned to deliver this important message to their diverse audiences across the continent,” said Robert Skinner, UN Senior Adviser for Global Communications. MultiChoice Group Executive Chairman, Imtiaz Patel, also noted that reliable information is vital to the fight against COVID-19. “The dissemination of credible information has become critical to fighting this epidemic, which continues to impact millions across the globe and our continent. “We are, therefore, honoured to be able to utilise the continental reach of our broadcast and digital platforms across Africa to empower people with vital information,” he said.
