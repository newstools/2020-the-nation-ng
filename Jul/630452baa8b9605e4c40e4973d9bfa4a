THE Benin National Congress (BNC) has opposed a planned protest against Capt. Hosa Okunbo, by a group loyal to Governor Godwin Obaseki, over the philanthropist’s perceived support for the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu. BNC, on Monday at a news conference in Benin, through its President, Mr. Aiyamenkhue Edokpolo, said the planned protest to the homes of Benin leaders would end at the palace of the Oba of Benin, Ewuare II, adding that it would hold any moment from now to embarrass billionaire industrialist Okunbo. The conference had as its theme: ‘In defence of Benin patriotism: Steer clear of Benin youths and our territory in your unholy campaign of calumny against exemplary Benin patriot.’ BNC said: “With reference to a mischievously-packaged orchestra, aimed at tarnishing the towering image of one of Benin’s distinguished sons, Capt. Okunbo, a multinational business mogul, by well-known entrepreneurs of violence and apostles of stone-age politics in Edo State, it is incumbent on us, as ambassadors of Benin’s peace and hospitality values, to warn the anachronistic elements to desist forthwith from their carefully-planned mission.”
