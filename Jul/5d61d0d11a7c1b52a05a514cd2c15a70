Renowned playwright, Prof. Femi Osofisan, and popular poet, Odia Ofeimun, have bemoaned the dearth of the theatre in the midst of COVID-19 pandemic. The writers noted that theatre practice in Nigeria had been troubled by many factors but more stifled by the global COVID-19 pandemic. They spoke with The Nation on Monday while celebrating Nobel Laureate Prof. Wole Soyinka’s 86th birthday. Recalling Soyinka’s contributions to the development of the theatre in Nigeria, the frontline writers expressed fears over the impact of the pandemic on theatre practice, if the situation is not redressed. Speaking with The Nation, Osofisan noted that theatre practice would be negatively impacted by the global pandemic unless urgent steps are taken to avoid this. He lauded the efforts of Soyinka in the development of theatre across the world. “I’m not happy about the state of the theatre now. The COVID-19 pandemic has helped to compound things: it had a situation that was already critical. Now that there is a lockdown, people can’t go out. The only means of entertainment is the internet and television, when you have light. But I’m equally worried about its impact on live theatre. “Soyinka represented the live theatre, which he and John Pepper Clark gave to us at the birth of Independence. Now, the live theatre is almost completely gone. The likes of the late Herbert Ogunde are definitely gone,” he said. Ofeimun, who authored the book, titled: Soyinka In Spite of Ogun, In Search of Nietzsche, said: “The theatre before COVID-19 was ever in trouble. Many groups were pitching into the need to change the theatre narrative for the better. But COVID 19 and the lockdown have grounded things.”
