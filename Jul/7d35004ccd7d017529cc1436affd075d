 GOVERNOR Godwin Obaseki has created a women wing of the Campaign Council of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). The inaugural meeting of the wing in Benin was chaired by Obaseki’s wife, Betsy, supported by PDP’s Board of Trustees (BoT) members: Prof. Stella Onu, a former senator; and Mrs. Josephine Anenih, ex-minister of Women Affairs. The governor’s wife, addressing members of the women wing of the campaign council of PDP, urged them to rise up, “since things are now different, with politics in Nigeria fast changing.” She noted that whenever she was in the midst of women, she was not just interested in politics, but also in how politics would deliver to Nigerians the results desired from it. Mrs. Obaseki said: “Some people play politics for their personal gains. They think only of themselves. Politics is changing in Nigeria, whether we like it or not. “The decent and patriotic politicians are more in number. Those supporting good governance and this government are more in number, they just happen to be decent.” Onu described the governor’s wife as a treasure that must be preserved at all costs. The PDP’s BoT member enjoined women to forget about persons who would want to lure them with money, saying they should always think about the future of their children.
