A governorship aspirant of APC in Ondo State, Mr Olayide Adelami, has blamed leadership of the party in the state for the exit of the embattled Deputy Governor, Mr Agboola Ajayi. At news conference on Thursday in Abuja, Adelami, a former Deputy Clerk of the National Assembly, said the inability of the party’s leadership to reconcile the aggrieved members led to Ajayi’s exit from the party. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that Ajayi had on June 21, dumped the ruling APC for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Adelami said that Gov. Rotimi Akeredolu, being the leader of APC in the state, would have towed the path of reconciliation rather than a faceoff with his deputy. “This is one of the key weaknesses of the incumbent governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, at managing people. “Ordinarily, Gov. Akeredolu should have towed the path of reconciliation rather than a face-off with his deputy, Agboola Ajayi. “In the coming days, it will not be a surprise, if other key personalities in his administration follow the same path of exit. “That is when the whole world will see the true picture of Akeredolu,” he said. The governorship aspirant urged the governor to provide the needed and necessary leadership to reconcile all aggrieved party members before the crisis escalated beyond control. He also urged the party National leaders to approve direct mode of primary for the July 20 poll in the state. “The popular opinion is a direct primary. I normally refer to it as election before election. “Nobody will be disenchanted, everybody will be given opportunity to express themselves,” Adelami said. (NAN)
