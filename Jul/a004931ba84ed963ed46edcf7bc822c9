 Benue Governor Samuel Ortom has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to declare armed herdsmen killing innocent Benue rural dwellers as terrorists. The Governor’s call followed repeated herdsmen’s attacks on Benue communities in the last few months. In a statement by his Chief Press Secretary (CPS) Terver Akase, the Governor said the latest of such attacks occurred on Saturday night at Tse-Chembe community near Anyiin in Logo Local Government Area where the herders murdered seven persons and left many others badly injured. Ortom condemned the killings and described the situation as unacceptable. He said Benue has a law, which prohibits open grazing of livestock and stressed that only a terrorist group would deliberately choose to violate the legislation as herdsmen have done since the law was enacted in 2017.  Ortom stated that declaring the armed herders operating in Benue State as terrorists will end the wave of impunity and guarantee the rule of law. He called on residents, particularly those living in the affected areas to report any suspicious persons to security agencies. The Governor commended officers and men of Operation Whirl Stroke for their prompt response to distress calls, particularly the last attack on Tse-Chembe. He reassured his administration will not surrender the state to criminal elements, be they herdsmen or any other group. Ortom said no amount of threats and attacks will stop the enforcement of the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law of the State.
