The Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption (PACAC) has not issued an official statement on acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) Ibrahim Magu, its Chairman Prof Itse Sagay (SAN) said on Tuesday. He said the statement issued on Monday by a member, Prof Femi Odekunle, was his personal opinion and does not represent PACAC’s position. Odekunle’s statement read: “This is a preliminary reaction of PACAC to the alleged ‘arrest’ of Magu…” He accused Attorney-General of the Federation Abubakar Malami (SAN) of lacking commitment to the anti-graft war and being the arrowhead of power blocs that want Magu out. Odekunle said Malami’s earlier memo calling for Magu’s removal and the EFCC’s boss’ invitation to appear before a probe panel over allegations of abuse of office “seem an outcome of power-play by power blocs in the corridors of power in which Malami appears to be an arrow-head or major agent”. But Sagay, in a statement by PACAC Communications Officer Aghogho Agbahor, said Odekunle spoke for himself. “The attention of the Chairman of the Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption (PACAC) has been drawn to a statement circulating in the media space credited to one of its members Prof Femi Odekunle. “The press release is the personal opinion of the member under whose name it was released and not that of the committee. “If the committee consistent with its mandate has any view on the matter, it will be channelled to the President and not to the media.”
