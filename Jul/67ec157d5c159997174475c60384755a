A FEDERAL High Court in Abuja heard on Wednesday how audio and video recordings were made of the interactions between erstwhile Kaduna Central Senator Shehu Sani and a businessman, Alhaji Sani Dauda, who accused Sani of obtaining $25,000 from him under false pretence. Dauda’s son, Mohammed, gave details of how he set up devices on two occasions to record what transpired between his father and Sani when the senator returned the money and begged for forgiveness. Mohammed was testifying as the seventh prosecution witness in Sani’s trial on a two-count charge in which he was accused by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) of obtaining $25,000 from Dauda, the Chairman of ASD Group of Companies, under false pretence. Led in evidence by the prosecutor, Abba Mohammed, the witness said the day Sani informed his father that he would return the money, his father called him to set up a recording device, as advised by the EFCC. “On that day, he (Sani) came to meet my father in his office here in Abuja. Before he went into the office, I set a recorder in my dad’s room and left to my own residence. “After he (Sani) had left, my dad called me to show him how to stop the recording device and I came and showed him.” “In the recording, he (Sani) came to beg. My dad told me what transpired when he came, that he was begging him not to disclose the case and to do whatever he could to forgive him. My dad then told him that the case was already with the EFCC and that he (Sani) had already been invited. “On either December 26 or 27, 2019, the senator came to my father’s house in Kaduna. When I heard he was coming, my dad asked me to set up the recording device again. I set it up and left.
