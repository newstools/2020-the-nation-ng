 RESIDENTS of Alagbole, Akute, Lambe, Agbado and neighbouring communities have hailed Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun for the palliative work being done on the Ojodu-Alagbole-Akute Road in Ifo Local Government. The governor last week directed the Ministry of Works to embark on the palliative measure, to ease the pains of residents and motorists. The road begins from Sango-Ota and links Berger in Lagos State. The ministry, through the Ogun State Public Works Agency (OGPWA), has since mobilised to site, pouring stones and other materials on bad spots along the 4.65km stretch. The Commissioner for Works and Infrastructure, Mr. Ade Akinsanya, assured the residents that a new road would be delivered to them when he visited workmen on site at the Alagbole end of the road yesterday. He said the palliative work ongoing in the area was just a temporary measure to reduce the hardship of road users. Akinsanya added that the road formed part of the public infrastructure the Governor Abiodun administration hoped to leverage on to revitalise the state’s economy. A resident, Mr. Joseph Alabi, said the road had become a nightmare. He said most residents stopped bringing their cars home because of the deplorable state of the road. Alabi said residents trekked long distances due to the scarcity of public transport, as commercial motorcyclists, popularly called Okada riders and Keke Marwa operators abandoned the road. He said Governor Abiodun’s intervention would alleviate their suffering. Alabi appealed to the governor to mobilize contractors back to site and ensure the completion of the project after the rainy season. Another resident, Ebenezer Adewole, said Governor Abiodun’s intervention was long overdue.
