Super Eagles striker Samuel Chukwueze may be thrown into the fray by Coach Javi Calleja as the Yellow Submarines continue  their pursuit of Champions League spot when they welcome Real Sociedad to Estadio de la Ceramica in today’s Spanish La Liga match. Coach Calleja will be without the services of Gerard Moreno and Vicente Iborra through suspension as well as Paco Alcacer, Carlos Bacca and Ramiro Funes Mori. B ut veteran midfielder Santi Cazorla and Javi Ontiveros are also expected to feature in attacking positions, while there could be a change at right-back with Mario Gaspar coming into the side.  Villarreal are currently fifth in La Liga on 57 points, six points clear of seventh-placed Sociedad, who have struggled for results since returning to action last month. Chukwueze and his teammates have been in excellent form since returning to action on June 13, winning six of their eight matches, drawing once and suffering one defeat, to rise up the table. Calleja’s side are four points clear of sixth-placed Getafe in the table, although they sit six points behind fourth-placed Sevilla, meaning that the Champions League spots are likely beyond them.
