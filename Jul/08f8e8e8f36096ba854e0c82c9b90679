 THE Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) has moved against debtors owing the Federal Government N9.8 billion by seizing their properties and parcels of land in Lekki, Lagos State. The affected properties included large expanse of lands occupied by squatters and mechanic village at Goshen Beach Estate and its environs. The debtors, according to a suit, are: Knight Rook Limited (under AMCON Receivership), Fibigboye Estates Limited and Grant Properties Limited. AMCON’s representative, Adedeji Aniyikaye-Quadri, said the move followed a June 18, 2020 ex parte order granted in the corporation’s favour by Justice Saliu Saidu. The order, seen by The Nation, attached the respondents’ properties for the liquidation of the N9,866,510,191.00 (billion) debt. It is to enforce a judgment debt AMCON won at the Federal High Court on October 3, 2017, before Justice I. N. Buba. AMCON, last Wednesday, took over 40 hectares of land on Lekki-Epe Expressway at Sangotedo, opposite Peace Garden City Estate in Ajah, pursuant to the same order. Aniyikaye-Quadri said AMCON executed the judgment following the respondents’ failure to settle the debt. He added: “We are not aware of any appeal challenging the judgment. “The order takes immediate effect. It is permanent and it affects everything fixed on the land – whether movable or immoveable -properties of the defendants.”
