The Nigerian Immigration Service has pleaded for speedy trials of 30 offenders who were arrested and currently facing prosecution in the Federal High Court, Katsina, for offences bordering on illegal entry into Niger Republic enroute Europe. The Comptroller General of the Service, Muhammad Babadende, said the trials have become imperative following the conviction of 12 others for similar offences by the court. The service said in a statement by its Public Relations Officer, Sunday James, that 42 Nigerians were arrested and sent to court for trial for illegal entry into Niger Republic enroute Europe, but only 12 have been sentenced by the court. The statement noted that Justice Hadiza Shagari, while delivering judgment on the matter,Â said the accused persons should either pay N50, 000 fine or be remanded in prison for three months. The Nigeria Immigration Service, Katsina State Command, received the repatriation of 42 Nigerians for illegal entry into Niger Republic and subsequently repatriated to Nigeria through the Kongolam Control Post, James said. The accused, who are between 18 and 35 years evaded immigration clearance and crossed the border to enter Niger Republic, he added. The Comptroller General, however, enjoined travellers to always present themselves to immigration officials for examination whenever they are travelling out or returning to the country.
