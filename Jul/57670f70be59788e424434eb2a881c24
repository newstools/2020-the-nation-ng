 In less than a month after the release of ‘911,’ Afro Pop musician Emmanuel Zion has dropped a second single entitled ‘Come Below.’ Though he began his music career in 2019 after several rap freestyle covers of songs by various artists, the Kogi State indigene has expressed his willingness to work with productive record labels but has released his first single, ‘911’ in 2020. Better known as Zyon and currently studying Mass Communication at the University of Kogi state, the young rapper is the toast of his institution. Emmanuel has been prolific in his style of music and has promised his fans that this is just the beginning of his sound, and pretty soon the world would accept him and his genre.
