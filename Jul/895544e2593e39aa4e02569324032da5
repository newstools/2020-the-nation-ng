Thomas Partey is ready to move to Arsenal according to European football journalist Graham Hunter who covers Spanish football for the likes of Sky Sports. Arsenal remain in talks with the player’s entourage and this was exclusively reported by Chris Wheatley of Gooner Talk back in May. The Rojiblancos have already begun their search for a replacement. The North London club have reportedly been in contact with Atletico Madrid and are said to have offered a sum less than the player’s 45 million buyout clause. The Madrid-based side have indicated that they will not accept any bid that does not match the 27 year old’s release clause.
