The Delta State Chief Judge (CJ), Justice Marshal Umukoro, yesterday directed judiciary staff in the state to work for three days a week, owing to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. From July 6, all judicial employees in the state are to work on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Justice Umukoro said that the current review on work attendance would remain in force until further notice. According to the CJ, courts in the state are to sit twice a week until further notice. Reacting to the circular, Mr Olisa Ifeajika, the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, said the decision for workers to work three days a week was peculiar to the judiciary. Ifeajika noted that no such directive had been given to other workers in the state. He, however, recalled that the state government had at the advent of the pandemic, ordered that its workers on salary grade level 10 and below should work from home. The chief press secretary said that the CJ might have contemplated a virtual approach to court sitting. He added that the presence of other judicial staff at court sitting might pose a challenge to government’s efforts to curb the spread of the virus.
