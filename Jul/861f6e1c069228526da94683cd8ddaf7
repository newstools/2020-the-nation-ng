Women in Akure, Ondo State, on Thursday protested the continued suspension of the only female lawmaker in the House of Assembly, Favour Semilore Tomomewo. They threatened to boycott the October governorship election if Favour is not recalled. The lawmaker was among the three legislators suspended by the leadership of the Assembly for alleged unruly behaviour. The women, under the auspices of the National Council for Women Society (NCWS), Ondo State chapter, protested at the office of Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice Adekola Olawoye, where they demanded reinstatement of Tomomewo. NCWS President Pastor Jumoke Aborode said the suspension of the only female lawmaker was an embarrassment to the womenfolk. She said it was a slap on the womenfolk not to have a voice in the Assembly as party primaries and elections are approaching. Olawoye said the protest should be directed to the House of Assembly.
