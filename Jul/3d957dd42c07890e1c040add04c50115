The only female governorship aspirant in the Ondo All Progressives Congress (APC), Mrs. Jumoke Ajasin-Afowonishe, has rejected results of the party primary in which Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu emerged as the party’s candidate. Akeredolu won the party primary with a wide margin of 2,458 votes while his closest rival, Chief Olusola Oke, polled 262 votes. Anifowoshe scored only two votes. In a statement issued Saturday in Akure by Director General of her campaign organisation, Hon. Kayode Arigbede, Anifowoshe said the process leading to the emergence of Akeredolu was flawed. She said the whole process was manipulated from the beginning to the end. The former Attorney-General noted the would affect the legitimacy and credibility of the APC government in Ondo State. According to her, “The process did not give room for a level playing field right from the date of screening to 9.00pm on Sunday 19th July, 2020 when the chairman of the primary election His Excellency Governor Yaya Bello of Kogi State addressed the aspirants. “The polling venue was not known until the night before the primary election whereas the winner had known this and prepared the venue for the election. “The voting process which should be secret voting was done in the full glare of those who were present. “Ballot papers could easily be linked to a voter as monitoring agents of the incumbent governor were around to watch over the delegates while only one agent was allowed per aspirant to be in the hall where voting took place. “In conclusion the indirect mode of primary election used is nothing to be proud of as a party and we refuse to accept the result. “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing” –Edmund Burke. Our Network cannot overlook the flaws as enumerated above as doing so will be doing injustice to our numerous supporters who planned and were ready for Direct Primary Election.”
