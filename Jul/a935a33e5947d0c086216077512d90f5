 KELECHI Iheanacho said  hard work is the only way Leicester City will recover from the setback of Wednesday’s 2-1 defeat at Everton as they look to respond with a victory over Crystal Palace tomorrow. City were two goals behind after just 16 minutes at Goodison Park following an early effort from Richarlison and Gylfi Sigurðsson’s penalty, but Iheanacho – a second-half substitute – halved the arrears after the break. But it wasn’t enough for the Foxes to secure a point in Merseyside, however, and, as they look ahead to Saturday’s visit of Palace to King Power Stadium, the Nigerian admits they ‘need to do more’ in future games. “It’s absolutely a tough one [to take],” Iheanacho told LCFC TV at full-time following Leicester’s third Premier League match since the Premier League’s resumption. “We need to do more. It’s not good enough from us. “We just need to get back and work on training. We got a goal back and we got a couple of chances, but unfortunately, we lost. We need to do more and get back to winning ways. In the next game, we need to fight and get the three points. “We did a bit more in the second half, but we need to do more if we [want] to compete. We have six games left, so we need to compete. “We need to get our mentality right, to fight until the end.” Iheanacho’s close-range finish in the 51st minute was his ninth goal in all competitions for the Foxes this season and he was pleased to contribute after emerging from the bench at half-time. However, the 23-year-old said adding to his tally of goals is little consolation following a defeat and insisted that he and his team-mates are determined to secure positive results over the remaining six games of 2019/20. Palace visit Leicester on Saturday for a 3pm kick-off before a trip to Emirates Stadium to tackle Arsenal next Tuesday (8:15pm kick-off) is followed by another away game at AFC Bournemouth on Sunday 12 July (7pm kick-off).
