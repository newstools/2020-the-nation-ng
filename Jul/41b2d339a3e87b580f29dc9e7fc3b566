 RESIDENTS of Ifetedo, Garage-Olode, Omifunfun, Aayeoba, Egbejoda, Araromi Oke-Odo and neighbouring communities in Ife South Local Government Area of Osun State on Tuesday jubilated, as the government unveiled plans to restore electricity to the areas. The communities have been without electricity for over 10 years. The Commissioner for Water Resources and Energy, Dr. Amidu Tadese Raheem, said the government had approved the procurement and installation of 33KVA Feeder Line that would supply electricity to the affected communities. He said Governor Adegboyega Oyetola’s resolve to restore light to the areas was in fulfilment of his promise to meet the people’s yearnings and aspirations. Raheem, who hailed the governor for giving the project a speedy approval, said the gesture would restore the lost glory of the people of the communities, thus resuscitating their paralysed socio-economic and commercial activities. The National President, Ifetedo Progressive Union, Alhaji Musedik Gbenga Ojuade, said the gesture would rekindle the hope of the people and help them return to a normal life. Ojuade, who spoke on behalf of the residents during a sensitisation parley at the Olubosin of Ifetedo’s palace, said the restoration of electricity had confirmed the commitment of the government to the well-being of the people.
