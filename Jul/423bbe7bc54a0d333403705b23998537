The Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr Boss Mustapha, other government officials and Christian leaders on Sunday attended the interdenominational church prayer service against the COVID-19 pandemic. The service is the culmination of three days of fasting and prayer organised by the Nigerian Inter-Religious Council. Meanwhile, the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 had asked Christians and Muslims to resort to prayers as the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise across the country. An Islamic prayer was held on Friday in Abuja where special prayers were rendered against the deadly virus.
