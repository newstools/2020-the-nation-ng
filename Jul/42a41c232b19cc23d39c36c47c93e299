 The Ooni of Ife Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi and others have paid for a charter flight to bring back stranded Nigerians in the United States of America and Canada. The flight, scheduled for July 25, will depart Newmark USA for Lagos. The Ooni said: “I did not think twice when they approached me for assistance to facilitate a charter flight for them. Many have been without their families for four months or more.”  He said the pandemic is a collective fight that requires support both at home and abroad. Managing Director of 7 Star Global Hanger Ltd, Mr Isaac Balami added: “We are working with all the necessary local and international authorities to make this possible and safe for passengers. The cost is reasonable, the booking and payment process is transparent.” He expressed appreciation to the Ooni of Ife for his support and wished all the passengers a safe trip and happy reunion with their love ones
