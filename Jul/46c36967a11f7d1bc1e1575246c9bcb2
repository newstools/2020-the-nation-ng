 ONDO State Independent Electoral Commission (ODIEC) has fixed August 22 for the conduct of local government election. It had fixed the poll for April 18, but suspended it due to the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. ODIEC Chairman Prof. Yomi Dinakin, who spoke in Akure at a meeting with leaders of the parties, said the commission would comply with the protocols of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 during the election. This is the first time local elections will be held in the state since the advent of the Akeredolu administration in 2016. The Chairman of Inter Party Advisory Council (IPAC), Mr. Charles Fagbounka, said the decision to hold local elections after a very long period of suspension due to COVID-19 pandemic was commendable. He said parties participating in the poll would ensure that the election was successful.
