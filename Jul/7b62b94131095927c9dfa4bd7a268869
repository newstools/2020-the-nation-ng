 The United Action for Democracy (UAD) has called on Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to return visitation panel to Lagos State University. The group said the visitation panel was in line with the regulation of the institution. A statement by UAD General Secretary Kunle Wizeman Ajayi said that the last visitation to the university was in 2009. The group said: We reiterate also, the need to have a Visitation panel in LASU as required by the law. We recall that the last visitation to the university was under Mr Babatunde Fashola in 2009, which was eleven years ago. The law provides for a visitation every five years. LASU is an institution funded by tax payers’ money. We are convinced beyond doubt that LASU has the potential to be one of the best in Africa if the government gets its decisions right rather than prioritising political considerations over and above best practices in its administration.  “LASU should not have the misfortune of a governing council again if there is to be objectivity in handling the myriad of unresolved issues and the crisis on ground. There is a limit to which organized media propaganda can suppress oppression.” The group disagreed with the Special Adviser to the Governor of Lagos State on Education, Mr Tokunbo Wahab that there is no crisis in LASU. “We find it most unfortunate that the Special Adviser has reduced the metric of excellence so low in the famed State of Excellence by using the number of convocation to measure success. We also note his allusion to the immediate past governing council noted for unprecedented corruption and disregard for law and order as being responsible for peace in the university. It confirms our suspicion that some powerful people in government are seeking to foist members of the 10th Governing Council for another four years, not in the interest of the university, but on account of political expediency,” the group said.
