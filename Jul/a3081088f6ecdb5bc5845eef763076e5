Comedian and radio host, Nedu has urged entertainers to desist from the use or abuse of drugs in seeking inspiration for their art. Chinedu ‘Nedu’ Ani Emmanuel made the remark during the MTN Foundation’s Anti Substance Abuse Programme (ASAP). He said, “I no go lie give you. Our entertainers need to speak out more and let people know that if you have inspiration, that’s it. You don’t need to take weed. And the celebrities that the kids follow these days they celebrate the taking of this thing like yeaaaaah! Ma fagbo mi!” [the yoruba translation for ‘I will smoke my weed!’ And he didn’t stop there, he pointed out that celebrities could lure young, impressionable people into addiction and drugs, indirectly. “Guess what, these guys have massive followership and if the people following you see you doing these things dem go take am dat d thing wey baba dey take, I go dey take am too,” he said. The Drug Convos is part of MTN Foundation’s initiative geared towards curbing substance-abuse among young Nigerians from ages 10-25.
