 ZAMFARA State Governor Bello Matawalle said the Inspector-General of Police Mohammed Adamu has approved the deployment of 780 personnel to the state curb banditry, Mr Yusuf Idris, the Director-General of Media, Public Enlightenment and Communications to the governor, said this in a statement on Monday in Gusau, the state capital. Idris said the personnel would be drawn from the Police Mobile Force (PMF), Counter Terrorists Unit (CTU), Special Forces and various other squads. Idris said that they would join other security agents in the final march to clear remnants of bandits from the state. The police deployment is coming on the heels of the ongoing special army operations taking place in the state. The operation would be led by the Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen. Tukur Buratai, alongside principal officers of the Army. Idris, however, said the governorâ€™s policy of carrot and stick approach to banditry would remain open for those wishing to lay down their arms and embrace peace.
