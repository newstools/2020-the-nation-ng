 GOVERNOR Godwin Obaseki’s wife, Betsy, has said the governor is backed by decent and responsible people for re-election. She spoke in Benin while inaugurating the women’s wing of the Obaseki/Shaibu Campaign Council, according to a statement by the Edo Publicity Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chris Nehikhare. Addressing the women, Mrs. Obaseki hoped that her husband would emerge victorious on September 19. She said: “Some people play politics for personal gains. This is not what we are interested in. We want everyone in Edo State to benefit from the government, not a few people with selfish reasons.” Senator Stella Omu noted that even if the opponents were given all the money in the world, their money would be of no value, adding that Obaseki had been destined to win. The Deputy National Women Leader of PDP, Hajia Adiza Umoru, urged the women to be bold anywhere they went to campaign for Obaseki and PDP. She said: “Whichever way you want to look at it, Governor Obaseki has performed well. He deserves another tenure to consolidate on his good work.” The Edo Women Leader of PDP, Deaconess Lindsay Sorae, advised the women to be steadfast and consistent, noting that playing double game would not be tolerated among the women. A former PDP national women leader, Mrs. Josephine Anenih, who is an ex-minister of Women Affairs, said Obaseki had plans for the state and he should be allowed to complete his administration’s laudable projects and programmes.
