 Former Ogun State governor Ibikunle Amosun has donated N25million to support the state government in its efforts to check the spread of Coronavirus. Sen. Amosun, in a letter dated March 31, written to Governor Dapo Abiodun, a copy of which was made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) yesterday, said the donation was a personal contribution to the fight against the pandemic. “Please be informed that N25million has been transferred and cleared into the Access Bank Account (No 1384210113 Ogun Coalition Against COVID-19) as my personal contribution for the management of COVID-19 challenges in Ogun State.  “ I am in constant touch with federal agencies in and outside Ogun with a view to offering maximum assistance to our people in these trying times. “In addition, arrangements are also in place to assist in ameliorating the challenges arising from the lockdown in Ogun within the period by supporting 25,000 households across the state. “ It is my fervent prayer that the Almighty God will see our people in Ogun and indeed Nigeria through the COVID-19 pandemic,” the letter stated.
