  KADUNA State Governor Nasir El-Rufai spoke of his COVID-19 status yesterday. He is still positive for the virus, he confirmed on Wednesday. El-Rufai, chaired the State Executive Council meeting through a video conference yesterday, made the disclosure on his Twitter handle afternoon. Urging Nigerians and Kaduna State residents to disregard conflicting news on his COVID-19 status, the governor promised to make a public statement when he is giving a clean bill of health. He tweeted yesterday: “Earlier today, between 10am and 2pm, I took few hours during my isolation and chaired a virtual meeting of the State Executive Council. “I have not been cleared of Covid-19 yet. I will personally announce when I am confirmed negative. Please ignore all fake news even if they are what you wish for.” El-Rufai commended his deputy, Dr Hadiza Balarabe, members of the State Executive and advisers for keeping the state running in his absence. “I am grateful to our team ably led by the deputy governor for keeping the agenda going without me. I am super proud of all our Commissioners, Advisers, Assistants, security agencies and other state government officials for a job well done,” the governor said.
