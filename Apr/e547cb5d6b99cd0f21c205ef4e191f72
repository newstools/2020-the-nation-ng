 The Benin Electricity Distribution Company (BEDC), on Friday, donated 1,500 bags of rice and 1,000 cartons of Indomie noodles to Ondo State government to cushion the effects of COVID-19 lockdown on the people of the state. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Mrs Kunbi Labiyi, the Chief State Head, BEDC, Ondo and Ekiti States, presented the items to Gov. Oluwarotimi Akeredolu at the Government House, Akure. She explained that BEDC would also ensure that the various government-established COVID-19 centres and related hospitals had good power supply up to 24 hours. “This has already commenced at the Disease Control Hospital on Igbatoro road, Akure, where we also intend to look at other supports that we can give to ensure that some of the vehicles/ambulances are fully operational. “Furthermore, 50 units of motorised hand washing gears will soon be donated to hospitals, strategic markets and some communities in our coverage areas,” she said. According to her, as a further demonstration, there has also been significant increase in power availability to several customers in the coverage areas. “We have also commenced the process of boosting the present grid power with additional power supply source through embedded generation,” she said. Responding, the governor assured that the ongoing distribution of palliatives was just the first round of the exercise. Akeredolu explained that when more food items came in either through donations or purchase by the state government, there would be more rounds of distribution. He thanked the company for the gesture and tasked the palliatives committee to add the items to those presently being distributed.  (NAN)
