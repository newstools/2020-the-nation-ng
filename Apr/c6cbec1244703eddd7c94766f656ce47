 OSUN State government on Wednesday received 49 Cote d’Ivoire returnees into the state, the Commissioner for Information and Civic Orientation Funke Egbemode said on Thursday. Egbemode in a statement issued in Osogbo, however charged residents not to panic over the arrival of the new returnees. Her words, “This is to officially allay the fears in the public domain, informed by insinuations that the State Government of Osun allowed a new batch of Ivory Coast returnees into the State, after the first experience which led to a surge of confirmed cases of the COVID-19 disease in the state. “The state government wishes to set the record straight, thus: 49 indigenes of Osun on Thursday returned to the state. 41 are from Ejigbo and 8 from Iwo. We have an official report showing they all have tested negative for COVID-19. “These 49 indigenes of Osun, on arrival from Cote D’Ivoire were graciously received by the Lagos State Government at the Nigeria-Benin border, were quarantined for 14-days in Lagos State’s facility in Badagry, where they were tested for COVID-19 infection during the period. Those who tested positive to the disease were moved into Isolation Wards in Lagos, while those who tested negative to the infection were cleared and those from Osun were allowed to proceed to Osun State. “The State Government of Osun hereby assures its citizens that there is no cause for alarm or reason to panic. The returnees who were accepted into the State have been certified to join the society by the appropriate agencies of the government. Hence, they pose no risk or threat to the people of Osun.
