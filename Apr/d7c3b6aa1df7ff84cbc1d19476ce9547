Operatives of the 81 Division, Nigerian Army on Monday paraded 11 fake military personnel alleged to have caused mayhem during the lockdown period. Ozonde Kelechi, Akingunola Folorunsho, Anusie Friday, Haruna Shuaibu, James Felix, Abeed Adewale, Oyeyemi Adetunji, Nwabuwanne Emmanuel, Adeniyi Adesokan, Shile Akin and Cynthia Dominic were arrested in different parts of the state over the weekend for breaching the stay-home order of the Federal Government. It was gathered that the division intercepted most of them during its “Operation Checkmate” launched to enforce discipline among military personnel and apprehend erring officers during this period. The Nation reports that this is the second time in a week the division has paraded suspected military  impersonators arrested while flouting the lockdown order. Parading the suspects, General Officer Commanding (GOC) Olu Irefin said some of the suspects were dismissed soldiers and naval ratings, adding that one of the suspects operated a vehicle fully painted in military colour. “One of them has a vehicle that is painted in full military color. The vehicle has been impounded and if it is going to be released, it has to be painted to normal color. These are the people giving us bad image. “The army will continue to sensitise the society and let people know that most illegal activities blamed on military are not by our operatives.”
