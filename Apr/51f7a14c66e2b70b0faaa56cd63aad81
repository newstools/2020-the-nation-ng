 SOME COVID-19 patients at the Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) Yaba have produced a video to improve awareness about the virus and thank health workers for nursing them back to health. The video shared on Twitter by Moji Delano (@mojidekanoblog) yesterday featured some 12 patients holding messages. The patients, among whom were three foreigners, wore face masks and covers that largely obscured their identities in one of the wards of the hospital. Some of the messages they bore reads: “Health workers also have families but they can’t stay at home; please stay safe; stay alive. #Lagoscovidgang2020.”; “It is real; we are living through this but we are confident we will overcome together; kudos to Lagos and its amazing team”; “Hey people, we are foreigners here and we are begging you to stay home for your relatives’ sake;” “Many thanks to the health workers; they have been a blessing.” Other messages were: “Please stay home. Thanks to the doctors, nurses, cleaners and all the health workers. We appreciate you,” “COVID-19 is real. Save your loved ones; save our health workers; stay at home;” “Shout out to the doctors, nurses, cleaners, potters, the entire Lagos State government. God bless Nigeria,” and one written in Hausa, which reads: “Lagos mungode da taimako ya zauwa a gida saboda COVID-19. Long live Nigeria.” Many people who commented on Delano’s Tweet expressed joy that the patients were doing fine.
