Justice Patricia Ajoku of the Federal High Court, Ibadan, on Thursday sentenced an internet fraudster, Adeshina Adedokun, to six months in prison for impersonating an American lady. Ajoku sentenced Adedokun based on the evidence before her and the plea bargain agreement he entered into with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). “This judgment is in line with Section 270 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act (ACJA) that provides for anyone who enters a plea bargain agreement. “Also, I observe that Adedokun has shown some level of remorse and I think that if given another chance he might contribute positively to the development of the society. “Therefore, the convict is sentenced to six months in prison and the sentence starts from the date he was first arrested,” the judge stated. Earlier, the counsel to the EFCC, Mr Oluwatoyin Oyedunni, told the court that the defendant was arraigned on a one-count charge of impersonation. Owodunni added that the convict committed the crime in October 2019 in Ibadan, Oyo State. He said the defendant was found with some documents that presented him as one Celine Gournet from the United States of America in the bid to defraud unsuspecting men who had interest in marrying her. The prosecutor said that the offence contravened Section 22 (2) (B) of the Cyber Crime Prohibition and Prevention Act, 2015. (NAN)
