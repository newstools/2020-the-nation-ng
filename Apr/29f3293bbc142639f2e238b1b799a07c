According to the report, “In 2019, the Study Group comprised 15 members who were split into seven teams comprising two persons per team for each geo-political zone, while the  five  international partners and the NTSG carried out verification tours around the nation to monitor and re-evaluate earlier scores submitted by each study team. The team rotated every quarter of the year for the six   geo-political zones of the country.” As the results have shown, Akwa Ibom State in South-south Nigeria has emerged the Cleanest State for last year, while FCT emerge the Cleanest City. Last year, five  states  scored were named clean, compared only three states the previous year. The practice of open defecation in all the  thirty-six states of the Federation and FCT is still very alarming and calls for increased knowledge of sanitation and hygiene to meet the MDG-target by 2025, it is noteworthy that the federal government of Nigeria in 2019 signed an MOU to increase both funding and education to combat open defecation.
