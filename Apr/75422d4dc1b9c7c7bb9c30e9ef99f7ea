Nigerian striker Odion Ighalo  six month loan deal to Manchester United from Shanghai Shenhua would most likely be extended  as speculations continue  about the future of  the 2019 AFCON top scorer. This much is the opinion of James Cooper,  the Sky Sports News’ North West reporter  as he assesses the futures of all 31 Man Utd first-team squad members ahead of the reopening of the transfer window. “The 30-year-old is scheduled to return to Shanghai Shenhua from his loan this summer but Solskjaer would like to keep him, and the Nigeria striker would like to stay. He has scored four goals in his last five appearances and shows the striking instincts that Solskjaer wants his other frontmen to hone, it also helps that Ighalo is a huge Manchester United fan.” Meanwhile, Ighalo has revealed that he feels “really inspired” by Manchester United since his move to the club in January and the Nigerian has revealed his intention to remain with the club. “I am inspired by a lot of things at United, I am really inspired and I am looking forward to spending more time with the team,” the striker said an interview with Manchester United’s website. “Seeing the club from the outside you don’t know how big it is. I am inspired by the way the club is structured.” In  a related development, Ighalo is reportedly one of the top menus  in the May edition of  Inside United which is already on sale. Said the magazine publisher: “Elsewhere in the magazine we retrace the steps of Odion Ighalo on his amazing journey from his footballing beginnings back home in Nigeria to fulfilling his dream of playing in the red of United (and scoring belters), via stops in Norway, Italy, Spain, England and China.”
