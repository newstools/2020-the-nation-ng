A trado-medical expert, Alhaji Hassan Ajeigbe, has called on the government to involve traditional medicine practitioners in the fight against Coronavirus. Ajeigbe, popularly called AMJE, urged the government to look inward for a local solution to the pandemic. According to him, part of the funds spent on purchasing testing kits could be diverted to the traditional institution to seek a solution to the pandemic. He praised governments’ efforts at containing the virus, saying they were far better than what leaders of developed nations were doing. “Sometimes, we do not appreciate what we have and view it as less important. I will suggest that traditional doctors should be involved in the fight against Coronavirus. “We should invest in traditional medicine and encourage its practitioners to come up with a cure for some deadly diseases. We can achieve it if giving necessary backing,” he said.
