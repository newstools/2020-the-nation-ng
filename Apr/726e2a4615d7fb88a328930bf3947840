Both the Federal and Lagos State governments have been advised not to extend the ongoing lockdown in Lagos State and Abuja. Rather, President Muhammadu Buhari and Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu should, as a matter of urgency, find ways to relax it. Chief Adesunbo Onitiri,a renowned socio-political activist and critic, gave this advice in a press statement in Lagos yesterday. He warned that any extension of the lockdown might lead to aggravated aggression borne out of hunger and immeasurable suffering by the masses. Chief Onitiri said what the government should do urgently is to peg the astronomical rise in food prices, provide drugs in government hospitals and offer free healthcare packages for the people. “This is the time to suspend taxes and drastically reduce the tax for the poor masses and provide free electricity for the poor. “If there is any lesson to be learnt from this Covid 19 pandemic, it is that we need to improve our healthcare system and education. We need to spend more on education of the masses and our health care.”
