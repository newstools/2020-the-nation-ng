As COVID-19 pandemic spreads across the globe, there is one thing we know for certain: In order to fight the spread of the virus, we must be vigilant in washing our hands and maintaining good hygiene. But what happens when you live in a part of the world that lacks access to clean water? TOBORE OVUORIE, after visiting some parts of Nigeria, writes in this photo essay that the Nigerian government has left many of its citizens in a precarious position without such access. Development and health experts say the government must make a more pragmatic Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) investment to prevent the spread of this – and other — deadly viruses.  THE BEGINNING  It all began even before the Wole Soyinka Centre for Investigative Journalism (WSCIJ) contacted me to pitch four COVID-19 related stories. Since 2019, I have been carrying out researches on water in Nigeria; ahead of some stories I should commence in May, 2020. While traveling across different parts of the country for other projects, I utilise every opportunity to document what I will call – Nigerians’ daily water experiences. Then, COVID-19 arrived like an entitled guest will turn up at one’s doorstep without either an invitation or notice before embarking on such visit. Like countries across the globe, Nigeria, West Africa’s most populous nation, is battling to curb the spread of COVID-19. Daily statistics of confirmed cases by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) indicate more Nigerians are contracting and spreading the coronavirus, though testing remains extremely limited. Dr. Osagie Ehanire, Nigeria’s Health Minister, recently told a group of journalists: “We have passed that era when people used to think that COVID-19 was something for big men and big women who came from abroad.” The country, he explained, is now in the community transmission phase of the deadly virus. NIGERIA’S BIG MISTAKE And while the Nigerian government has been expanding test and quarantine centres in various parts of the country, it has been largely failing to address one of the most basic preventive measures: clean water. Television, radio jingles and other publicity materials keep instructing and depicting Nigerians washing their hands with water and soap under running taps. But regular hand-washing under flowing taps is a luxury for many Nigerians. In fact, the 2017 Multiple Indicator Cluster indicates Nigerian households mainly depend on external sources such as water cart-pushers popularly known as Mai-ruwa in many parts of the country, for their access to water because most homes do not have potable water within their premises. Global agencies such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) say no fewer than 60 million Nigerians still lack access to potable water while not more than 10 percent of Lagos State residents are connected to the government water source. Dr. Adebayo Adedeji, a virologist and former director of Laboratory Sciences at the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), says this virus not only calls attention to the quality of water Nigerians can access but also the means by which they access it. International standard practice states that nobody should travel more than 100 meters before accessing water. This is not the reality for over 60 million Nigerians who have to micromanage the water they often get from unsafe sources such as open wells and water vendors. Adedeji warns that man-to-man transmission of COVID-19 can happen if proper preventive measures such as healthy hand hygiene, against contracting and spreading the virus are not observed during the process of fetching the water. Here are some of Nigerians’ water experiences in a photo and multimedia essay.               International standard practice states that nobody should travel more than 100 meters to have access to water. This is not the reality for many Nigerians who not only travel long distances, but get water for their daily use from open wells. At the open well where they get water daily, everyone fetching water use their bare hands in handling the same plastic container which is put into the well. A person who has contracted the virus can spread it to others through this means.   After fetching water, they travel long distances back home, again, without observing social distancing. March 2020, many of the persons who depend on this well said they barely have enough water to last them through a day. So, regular hand washing is not their priority. Except deliberate efforts are made to bridge the water gap and injustice in the country, Nigerians will not only continue to waste so much time to hunt for just any water, but would be at risk of contracting deadly diseases such as the COVI-19 in the process of hustling for the water.         In a field research carried out by this reporter from April 17th to April 20th, 2020 in Ogun and Lagos states respectively, in the Southern part of Nigeria, most of the 67 respondents interviewed said they do not have water flowing in the taps of their apartments.  The respondents include 37 and 30 residents in Ogun and and Lagos states respectively, while 35 of them are females and 31 males between the ages of 22 to 56 years.      Dr. Ipoade Omilaju, Principal Consultant at Sharry Moore Strategic Konsult in Abuja, says the Nigerian government should have made makeshift water sources – tap and boreholes, available at every ward, the least cadre of governance in Nigeria, but can still do it if they choose to be responsive and accountable. He warns that if the Nigerian government does not become proactive, curbing the community transmission of the virus in Nigeria may be slower — and with dire consequences in both the short- and long- term.
