 The Nigeria Export Processing Zones Authority (NEPZA) has assured host communities of free trade zones in the country the allocation of 60% jobs. NEPZA in a statement signed by the Acting Managing Director, Bitrus Dawuk said the management of the processing zones are putting modalities in place to ensure its policy on allocation of 60% jobs is fully implemented. He disclosed  this while reacting to the recent labour crisis at Ogun-Guandong Free Zone, Igbesa, Ogun State, stating that industrial dispute between the workers and management of Goodwin Ceramic Free Zone Enterprise (FZE) located in the Zone, was necessitated by the extension of lockdown  by government to curtail the spread of coronavirus pandemic, which prompted several workers of the Enterprise mostly from the North- East demanding for  additional payment to stay or vacate the Zone. The Acting MD noted that despite the pleas by the Zone’s management and security agencies that the workers should stay in order not to expose themselves to the COVID-19 pandemic and the financial payment  provided for them to cater for their needs, the plea fell on deaf ears. The Authority discovered that its policy on 60 percent recruitment of people from the catchment area was not fully enforced by the Free Zone Enterprise, which is among d reason for the labour crisis.
