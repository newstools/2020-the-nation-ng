The Actors Guild of Nigeria under the leadership of Ejezie Emeka Rollas has reached out to the needy across the country as a result of the COVID-19 lockdown. This, according to the President of the guild, Ejezie Emeka Rollas, is in line with the guild’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) to humanity. Rollas hinted that the guild’s short-term plan is to feed over 10,000 people within the six geopolitical zones in Nigeria, starting with  Surulere, Lagos. He said: ” We will send materials to all the chapters to distribute. We principally know that there are members who are up and coming and not doing very well. So, in this lockdown, we believe we have to try to cushion the effect on our members and members of the public who have actually patronized actors over the years.” Continuing, Rollas said, “Already, we had sent palliatives to Abuja Chapter of the guild, Lagos State Chapter and as well as Delta State chapter.  What we are doing now, is the distribution to the public. We started with Surulere and also touched other LGAs; Ifako Ijaye and others. This is just the first phase. We plan to feed 10,000 people as soon as we get more money from our sponsors. We are also seeking the Federal and State government partnership.” Rollas also appreciated his colleagues and patrons who donated funds for the first phase of AGN’s COVID-19 Community Reach Out. “The palliatives we distributed were made available by three of our patrons, Chief Alexander Ejiamatu, Chief Tony Ikpea, and Deacon Kalu. Apart from that, members of our committee headed by Hon Desmond Elliot made their personal contributions. Monalisa Chinda, Uche Elendu, Charles Inojie, Ada Ameh, Yul Edochie, Ronnie Dikko, Belinda Effah, Zack Orji, Segun Arinze, Charles Awurum, Ngozie Nwosu, Emeka Duru, Kanayo O Kanayo and lots of them.
