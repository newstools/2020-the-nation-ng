By Linus Oota, Lafia  Nasarawa Governor, Engr Abdullahi Sule, has signed the State Procurement Bill into law. Speaking shortly after appending his signature to the draft bill at the Government House Lafia, the Governor described the event as not only historic but also indicative that Nasarawa State has finally joined the league of elite states known for transparency and accountability. The Governor however noted that signing of the procurement bill alone may not be enough until government is able to put in place a team that will head the State Bureau for Procurement for monitoring and enforcement of the tenets of the law. Sule promised by Monday, his administration will put a team together as members of the Bureau. According to the Governor, only persons of known integrity, who must be competent, experienced and capable, will make the team, irrespective of political or ethno-religious considerations. “For me and this administration, if this is one of the legacies that we are leaving behind, we are indeed leaving behind a legacy,” Sule stated. He expressed hope the state stands to benefit from subsequent grants from the World Bank, Central Bank of Nigeria, among other organisations, given to states that have the procurement law in place. “The qualification is not just about the World Bank grant, but to actually show that in Nasarawa State, we understand the rules of accountability, the rules of transparency and will be seen as people who are honest, in what we are doing and we are working very hard to ensure that things are working correctly,” he stated. Presenting the bill before the Governor, Speaker Ibrahim Balarabe, said the bill when signed into law, will in no small measure add value to the state.
