  CIVIL society organisations (CSOs) have deployed 1000 monitors to evaluate the processes and impact of the various COVID-19 palliatives across the country. The groups said the deployment was aimed at ensuring transparency in the distribution process and to ensure the measures reach the end users. Human and Environmental Development Agenda (HEDA Resource Centre) in collaboration with the Women Advocates Research and Documentation Centre (WARD-C) deployed the monitors last weekend across nine states and Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The assessors will also monitor utilisation of the various COVID-19 intervention funds, they said in a statement yesterday. Nigeria has seen a string of intervention funds ranging from private donations to channelled local and international funds in cash and other materials, including food and medicare. According to the civil right groups, there has been no transparency framework at the federal and state levels on fund utilisation, “fuelling a public mill of rumours.” As at last Friday, funds raised at home stood at N25.8billion apart from the N21billion European Union (EU) support and donations material for China. The CSOs said public knowledge on the expenditure of COVID-19 donations is critical to sustainable development. A joint statement signed in Lagos by HEDA’s Chairman, Mr Olanrewaju Suraju and his WARD-C counterpart, Dr. Abiola Akiode-Afolabi said the volunteers will produce a comprehensive report covering strategic areas using  jointly developed questionnaire tools designed to meet global best practices.
