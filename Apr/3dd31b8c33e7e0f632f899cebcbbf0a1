Britain’s Prince Philip, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II, on Monday paid tribute to health staff and medical researchers working to curb the novel coronavirus pandemic. “As we approach World Immunisation Week, I wanted to recognise the vital and urgent work being done by so many to tackle the pandemic. “Especially those in the medical and scientific professions, at universities and research institutions, all united in working to protect us from Covid-19. “On behalf of those of us who remain safe and at home, I also wanted to thank all key workers who ensure the infrastructure of our life continues. “The staff and volunteers working on food production and distribution, those keeping postal and delivery services going, and those ensuring the rubbish continues to be collected, ’’ Philip wrote in a message published online by Buckingham Palace. The palace said the queen and Philip left London for Windsor Castle in March as a “sensible precaution” amid the spread of Covid-19. The queen’s eldest son and heir, Prince Charles, 71, was self-isolated at one of his homes in Scotland after he tested positive for the virus and experienced mild symptoms. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was also infected with Covid-19, requiring several days of intensive care in hospital, while he is still recovering at home.
