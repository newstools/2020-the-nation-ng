Nigeria’s terminal operators, APM Terminals Apapa (APMT) and the West Africa Container Terminal (WACT) Onne, Port Harcourt, Rivers State, have jointly committed more than N300million to the battle against the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the country. A breakdown of this shows that APMT has contributed N150 million into the Federal Government’s COVID-19 Relief Fund Account created by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) while WACT has contributed N50million into the same account. In addition to these, APM Terminals Apapa has donated 1,000 units of nose masks; 500 disposable protective coveralls; 400 litres of hand sanitizers; protective goggles and hand gloves to the Lagos Port Complex of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) towards curtailing the pandemic. The donation into the COVID-19 Relief Fund Account and the donation of safety items are coming barely two weeks after the company donated $200,000 (over N75million) into the United Nations in Nigeria Basket Fund for the fight against COVID-19 in Nigeria, and committed another N25 million on community awareness through radio, social media as well as fliers to sensitize the Apapa community on how to curb the spread of the pandemic. Speaking on the donations, the Managing Director of APM Terminals Apapa, Mr. Martin Jacob, said, “This is one battle we must join hands together to fight, and with the strong leadership being provided by the Federal Government, Nigeria will overcome this difficult times.”
