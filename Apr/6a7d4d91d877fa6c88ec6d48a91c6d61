 Ondo State Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has promised to compensate owners of Ansar-Ud- Deen Mega Primary School, Oke- Agbe in Akoko North West Local Government. He said acquisition of the school was not to spite owners of the school and the Muslim community. Akeredolu spoke through the Chairman, Ondo State Muslim Welfare Board, Alhaji Khaleel Fawehinmi, when a delegation of Ansar-Ud-Deen Society Worldwide in Akure visited. He said the takeover of the school was to upgrade and bring higher education closer to the grassroots.  The governor said a committee has been set up to look for a big land to build a befitting edifice for the school. He said his administration would not treat any individual or group of persons as second- class citizens based on their political, tribal or sectarian inclination. Akeredolu hailed Ansar-Ud-Deen Society for sending a fact-finding delegation to verify knotty issues concerning the acquisition of the school. The leader of the delegation, who is also the National Missioner of Ansar- Ud-Deen Society, Sheikh Abdur Rahman Ahmad, said the state has gained reputation for accommodating people of diverse faith.
