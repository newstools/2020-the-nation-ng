September 2020 has been set as the date for the Africa International Music Summit. The organisers of the summit have set September 1 – September 3, 2020, as the new date for the event.  According to the media director, Mr. Kaycee Ogunjiofor, the shift in date was necessitated by the outbreak of the coronavirus that has spread around the world. “It will be insensitive to hold the summit at such a time like this. The world is at a standstill due to the COVID-19, there is a total lockdown in most of the world including Nigeria, it will not be safe to bring people together when we should be practicing social distance to help curb the spread. We hope that by July, life would have returned to normal and businesses would have resumed fully thereby giving us another 2 months to put things together.” He posited that the need to expand the sources of income for the nation has been clearly stated through the ravage this pandemic has done. He stated that unlike previous times, the COVID-19 has confined everybody to their homes and our leaders are now experiencing how bad our healthcare system is. So, we must diversify our economy and identify those resources that can help our economy grow. The music business is a key area that the government must focus on.
