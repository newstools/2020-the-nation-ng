German actress, writer and politician Barbara Ruetting has died at the age of 92, her best friend said on Thursday. Ruetting died, surrounded by her closest friends, last Saturday in the Bavarian town of Marktheidenfeld, her best and co-worker added. Over the course of her career, Ruetting starred in over 45 films, including the 1961 film “Town Without Pity” alongside Kirk Douglas. She cemented her status as a top actress among German audiences with her starring role in 1956’s “Die Geierwally,” about a rebellious farmer’s daughter who refuses to accept an arranged marriage. The Brandenburg-born actress also appeared in many stage plays before she ended her acting career in 1984. Following her successful acting career, Ruetting became a health consultant and wrote health guides and cookbooks on wholefood cuisine. She’s considered a pioneer of vegetarianism in Germany. Ruetting was also politically active up through her later years. She sat in the Bavarian state parliament for the Green Party for six years, before switching to the small V-Partei3 (V-Party3), which advocates environmental protection, vegetarianism and veganism. “With the passing of Barbara Ruetting, we have lost a politician who was deeply committed to animal and environmental protection,” said the president of Bavaria’s state parliament, Ilse Aigner.
