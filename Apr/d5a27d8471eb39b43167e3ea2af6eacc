Two suspected cult members, Korede Pariosho and Jide Afolabi, have shed light on how one Kolawole Ajomale, a member of the Oodua People’s Congress (OPC) was killed. They said they invaded Ajomale’s home in Ijebu-Igbo, Ogun State, on April 5 and killed him to avenge the death of their member. Pariosho and Afolabi said they shot him in the head and stomach in the presence of his expectant wife. The suspects, who have been arrested by police, told detectives that one of their cult members was killed in 2017 by people suspected to be OPC members, and that since then the cult group vowed never to rest until they avenged their member’s death. Police spokesman Abimbola Oyeyemi, who made this known in a release, said Commissioner of Police, Kenneth Ebrimson has directed that the suspects be transferred to the homicide section of the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (SCIID) for a discreet investigation and prosecution. Abimbola, a Deputy Superintendent of Police, said the suspects were arrested yesterday following intelligence-based investigation by detectives at Ijebu-Igbo Police Division led by Superintendent of Police Kazeem Solotan. The gun allegedly used to shoot Kolawole dead, the police spokesman added, was recovered from the suspects. Since the suspects allegedly attacked the victim in his house at No. 20, Odo Balogun Street Oke Sopen, in Ijbeu-Igbo and killed him, the police had been on their trail.
