The Joint Health Sector Union (JOHESU) has called for a reliable template for the structuring of hazard allowance for health workers in the post-COVID-19 era. On April 21, the Federal Government facilitated a temporary Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with some Health Sector professional bodies based on a proposal by Nigeria Medical  Association  (NMA). JOHESU, which was not originally slated to be part of the meeting, was invited at the latter stages. The statement frowned at NMA’s decision to present a selective list of health workers to benefit from COVID-19 hazard allowances, insisting the entire value chain of health workers, including non- clinical, must benefit.  The union observed that not all doctors were equally exposed to the air, surfaces and persons carrying the virus and demanded equal pay per hour. “When you are present for a number of hours, you are paid, when you are absent, you are not paid. As it is now, the ‘top’ and senior doctors staying at home are getting the highest allowances. “An equal life insurance for all practitioners is the right thing to do. Let everyone be appreciated equally in all ways. The defenders and goal scorers in football matches are not isolated for praise, the whole team wins and are equally appreciated. You do not single out health professionals, you call them all health care workers”, it said.
