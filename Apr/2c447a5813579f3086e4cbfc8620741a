The Police have arrested a man, Joshua Abraham, 43, for stealing a new born baby placenta in Ibafo area of Ogun State. The suspect was arrested following report by one Raliha Zakara, the grandmother of the baby, at Ibafo Police station that the suspect who happened to be her neighbour came to the hospital where her daughter was delivered of the baby and posed as the father of the new baby, demanded for the placenta  and was handed over to him by the nurse on duty. The Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, who disclosed this in a release, said when the suspect collected the placenta, he took it away on the pretense that he was going to bury it. Abimbola, a Deputy Superintendent of Police, said further that when the grandmother of the baby got to the hospital and was informed that the suspect had collected the Placenta, she quickly confronted him, but was told that it has been  buried. However, when the grandmother insisted on seeing where he buried it, she discovered that he hid the placenta but showed her where he  buried a dead rat instead. According to the Police Spokesman, the Divisional Police Officer for Ibafo Division,  Abiodun Ayinde, who got the report, detailed detectives to the scene and arrested the suspect. Abimbola noted that the suspect was discovered to have once been arrested for defrauding a police officer and a pastor of huge sum of money under the pretence of procuring Canadian visa for them, stressing that the case is pending in court. The suspect later took the detectives to where he hid the placenta and was recovered while the Commissioner of Police, Kenneth Ebrimson directed that a thorough investigation be carried out on him with a view of charging him to Court.
