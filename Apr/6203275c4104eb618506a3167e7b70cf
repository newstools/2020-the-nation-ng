LASACO Assurance Plc has provided N1billion free insurance cover to 200 frontline health workers in Osun State, its Managing Director, Mr Segun Balogun, has said. Balogun, in a statement, said the  workers involved in containing the disease would enjoy insurance  worth N5 million each to cover death/permanent disability and medical/hospitalisation expenses. According to him, the gesture was to boost the morale and motivate the workers, who are in the fore-front of the battle against COVID-19 and are, thus, exposed to several risks. He emphasised the need of such protection for the workers to enable them focus on their duty. He commended Nigerians for cooperating with the government in the fight against the disease and advised them to continue to observe social distancing and other preventive measures eradicate the disease. He promised that the company would continue to provide Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) to support the government. LASACO Assurance, along with other leading insurers and Ark Insurance Brokers, also provided insurance cover of N5 billion along with others for 1000 health workers and volunteers.
