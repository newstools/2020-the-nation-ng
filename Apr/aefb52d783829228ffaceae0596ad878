 THE Federal Government has inaugurated an inter-ministerial committee to engage 774, 000 Nigerians to maintain public and social infrastructure in rural communities. It is expected to spend N46.4 billion on the Special Public Works (SPW), which will be implemented by the National Directorate for Employment (NDE) across the local governments in the country. The workers, under the SPW, will earn N20, 000 each in three months, totalling N46.4 billion, to ensure the rehabilitation of public infrastructure. Minister of State for Labour and Employment Festus Keyamo, during the inauguration of the committee in Abuja on Wednesday, said that the SPW was aimed at recruiting 1,000 persons across the 36 states, including the Federal Capital Territory. He said that President Muhammadu Buhari last October approved a pilot special public works programme for implementation by the NDE in five local governments in each of the eight pilot states. The minister said the programme is part of the government’s job creation drive designed to mitigate lack of job opportunity in the rural communities. Keyamo described the programme as “a dry/off season transient job programme targeting the rehabilitation/maintenance of public and social infrastructure with the participants drawn from the pool of unskilled rural persons.”
