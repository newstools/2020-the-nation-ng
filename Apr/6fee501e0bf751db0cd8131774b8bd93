SUPER Eagles forward Josh Maja has put West Ham and Crystal Palace on alert for a return to English football. The 21-year-old, has developed well at French side Bordeaux after joining from Sunderland, where he was a goalscoring machine. Now the Hammers and Palace are looking into a swoop for the Londoner, whose price tag has soared to around Â£10million. West Ham are in the market for new blood up front. While Palace were keen on Maja after he notched 16 goals in League One for the Black Cats in 2018-19. Both clubs have funds for signings and are also in the market for emerging English talent. Maja left Sunderland last January, and he has scored nine goals in 31 appearances for Bordeaux.
