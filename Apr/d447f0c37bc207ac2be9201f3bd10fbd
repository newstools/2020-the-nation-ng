From Eric Ikhilae, Abuja  A petitioners’ witness has told the tribunal hearing the petition in relation to the last election in Kogi West Senatorial district that he was absent when votes in his ward were counted and results announced. The witness, Ibrahim Jimoh said he served, during the election, as a Collation Agent of the petitioners – the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its candidate, Dino Melaye – in the Ijumu Ward. Jimoh, who had earlier adopted his written statement, said under cross-examination, that he was absent at the venue of the declaration of result after votes were counted. He admitted relying on the result as announced by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) after the election. When asked by lawyer to Smart Adeyemi ( All Progressives Congress’ candidate and winner of the election), Oladapo Otitoju, whether he witnessed the counting of votes in his ward, Jimoh said no. On whether the ballot papers were counted in his presence, the witness said no, but that he relied on INEC report and what other agents told him. When asked how he got the results of the election, Jimoh said, ”I was not there. I was not on ground. Yes, It was the second agent that came to tell me the figures.” Jimoh equally admitted that the election went on peaceful and was without violence. Another petitioners’ witness, Ademola Samuel, who claimed to be a farmer, adopted his written witness statement upon mounting the witness stand. On being cross-examined by Otitoju, Samuel told the tribunal that he examined the results after the election. When asked to dwell more on his analysis of the examination of the election results, the witness said he acted based on what he was told. Further hearing in the petition by the PDP and Melaye has been adjourned till April 20 this year.
