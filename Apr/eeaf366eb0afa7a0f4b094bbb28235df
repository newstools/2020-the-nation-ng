 The Etsu Nupe and Chairman, Niger Council of Traditional Rulers, Alhaji Yahaya Abubakar has begun the distribution of food items and an undisclosed amount of cash to indigent persons across the Bida Emirate Council as palliatives. The traditional ruler at a brief event in his Wadata palace, Bida said that the gesture was part of efforts to alleviate the suffering of the people of the Emirate during the shut-down of the state and nation. According to the Royal Father, the items and cash were donated by philanthropic individuals within and outside the Emirate. The Emir also announced the formation of a five-man committee to take charge of the even distribution of the food items and money to the Intended beneficiaries across the six local government areas in his domain. The Monarch charged the members of the committee to live above board as well as ensure fairness and fear of God in the discharge of the food items. Etsu Nupe also appealed to wealthy Nigerians to assist the less privileged in the society with food items and money, so that that they would be able to observe the lockdown with less stress. “It is important that the highly placed individuals in the society should fathom out succor for the less privileged in the society. “I want to appeal to wealthy individuals in my kingdom and beyond to assist the less privileged ones during this trying time as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. He also commended all those who have contributed to his domain, the state and indeed Nigeria, saying “God Almighty will richly reward their kindness.” The Etsu Nupe said the items included 4,000 cartons of indomie, 145 bags of rice and millets, 30 bags of semovita, 25 cartons of Maggi, 10 cartons of spaghetti and an undisclosed amount of money.
