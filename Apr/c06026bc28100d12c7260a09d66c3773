 Some Youths in Kaduna State on Wednesday shared experiences of how they are coping with government’s stay-at-home directive, meant to curtail the spread of the Coronavirus pandemic. The youth, who spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in separate telephone interviews, said they had made good use of their time by being productive and improving on themselves. Shamsuddeen Abdulkadir, a 28-year-old software engineer, said he had been using the period to learn more about mobile app development rather than staying at home bored. Abdulkadir said he had wanted to learn programme coding for long but had no time until now. “The course contains 17 chapters and I am on chapter 10. “I also read the Qur’an and chat less on social media,’’ he said. Abbas Abdul, a resident of Barnawa and a product designer, said he used the “stay-at-home” period to draw his designs daily and create visuals. According to him, this has helped to improve his designing skills. Abdul said that he has also engaged in indoor sports, to keep himself fit. Also, Hajara Muhammad, an undergraduate, told NAN that the break gave her the opportunity to rest and reduce stress, adding that she reads the Quran, chats on social media and watches movies. Similarly, Mareeya Ibrahim, another undergraduate, said she used the period to improve on her baking skills. Ibrahim said that she also produces pillowcases and bed-sheets. She then urged youths to engage in activities that would benefit them and not waste their time doing nothing during this period. Daniel Ayuba, a fashion designer, told NAN that he was using the period to design more clothing, thus adding to his collections. He urged Nigerians to be prayerful and abide by all the health tips to stay safe. (NAN)
