Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike has warned ward leaders against diverting palliatives meant to cushion the effects of measures adopted by his government to fight the coronavirus pandemic in the state. Wike while distributing foodstuffs to the 13 wards of Ikwerre Local Government Area, urged the leaders not to betray the trust reposed on them by the government. The governor, who was represented by Rivers State COVID-19 Palliatives Committee headed by Amb. Desmond Akawor, delivered the foodstuffs to all the 13 wards in Ikwerre. Akawor said: “You were selected by your respective wards as clerics, youth leaders and traditional Rulers to share these foodstuffs.  Don’t betray the trust of the people.  Make sure that they get the foodstuffs. ” He said that Wike decided to reach the less privileged because many people were suffering following the measures put in place to stop coronavirus. Akawor directed the community leaders, clerics and traditional rulers from the 13 wards to ensure that the foodstuffs were shared to people, who could not afford them.
