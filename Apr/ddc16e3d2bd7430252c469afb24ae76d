Odion Ighalo will have to accept a staggering £200,000-a-week wage cut if he wants to seal a permanent move to Manchester United. Ighalo joined United in a shock loan move from Chinese Super League outfit Shanghai Shenhua in January and United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is willing to offer the 30-year-old a permanent deal ahead of the start of next season. But Old Trafford bosses are not willing to match the current £300,000-a-week wages Ighalo currently earns in China – and have warned him their offer will be no more than £100,000-a-week. It remains to be seen if Ighalo, 30, will be willing to take such a huge financial hit. Ighalo’s current loan deal is due to expire on May 31 and United will look to extend it, with the current campaign expected to run until June and July due to the pandemic.  United will then look to negotiate a full-time deal with Ighalo, who admits he is open to moving to Manchester on a permanent basis. He said: “I’m on loan until the end of the season, which has not expired. Now it’s for us to finish the season very well, and if I do well, score more goals, if possible, then after the season we’ll see what’s on the table.”
