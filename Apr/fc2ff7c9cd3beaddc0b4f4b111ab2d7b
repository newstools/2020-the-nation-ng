MainOne has partnered the Lagos State Government and National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to help curtail the COVID-19 spread in the state. The firm is enabling the COVID-19 Command Centre and isolation facilities with high-speed connectivity infrastructure to facilitate effective monitoring, communication and response, as its contribution to the state’s efforts to fight the pandemic. The CSR solution will ensure that the state government, health officials and doctors on the frontline s battling the pandemic are well connected with each other and to the rest of the world. This is being achieved via the provision of high-speed internet access as well as managed Wi-Fi services to the five isolation and command centres spread across the state in Yaba, Ikeja, Gbagada, Lagos Island and Ikoyi, in addition to the state’s command centre. The centre plays a critical role in enabling the government to monitor the spread of the disease, using algorithms, data analytics and surveys to localise the spread and update stakeholders on the current COVID-19 situation in the country. The connectivity will provide a platform for exchanging up-to-date scientific findings and knowledge on the disease with colleagues around the world, thus positioning the country as partners in the global fight against the pandemic. Sales Manager Public Sector, MainOne, Funmike Olayera, said: “We understand that our healthcare centers are our first line of defence. We appreciate the work the health care workers, the state government and the NCDC are putting in to ensure we curtail the spread of the virus in Nigeria.”
