English Premier League and La Liga teams have been handed a boost in their pursuit of Victor Osimhen with the agent of the Lille striker, Jean-Gerard Benoit Czaika ruling out a move to the Italian Serie A, specifically Inter Milan. Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur have been linked with a move for the Nigeria international, while Barcelona, Real Madrid and Sevilla are his Spanish suitors. Asked if Inter were interested in the Super Eagles attacker, Czaika told Inter dipendenza :”Absolutely not, there is nothing. I don’t think he can complete his growth path in Italy, where there is an important problem: racism”. Players of African descent such as Marco Zoro, Paul Pogba, Angelo Ogbonna, Kévin Constant, Kwadwo Asamoah, Mario Balotelli and Moise Kean have been racially abused while representing Italian clubs. Many elite European clubs are interested in Osimhen after a fine start to his career at Lille that has seen him score 18 goals in all competitions this season.
