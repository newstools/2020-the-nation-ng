Nigerian duo of David Okereke and Dennis Emmanuel  will have to wait a bit longer to be confirmed  the champions with Club Brugge  after the  Belgian Jupiler League board  pushed back meeting to decide fate of 2019-20 season. The nation’s top division had looked set to render the season void, but a meeting to decide the issue has been delayed until April 24. Belgium’s Pro League have pushed back the date for a meeting to decide whether or not the 2019-20 season should be cancelled. Last week, organisers recommended rendering the season void, with the coronavirus pandemic having seen all but a handful of sporting competitions across the world put on hold. UEFA later insisted that any such decision was premature and that cancelling the whole campaign must be seen as “a last resort” by all member associations.  A Pro League general assembly had been called for April 15 to discuss the findings of a working group tasked with assessing the sporting and financial implications of declaring the season over. However, a statement yesterday  confirmed the assembly has been delayed until April 24, when all Pro League clubs will be invited to attend.  “The members of the working group appointed by the board of directors are now continuing their duties,” the statement added. Club Brugge were runaway leaders of the Pro League when the last round of fixtures were played on March 7, 15 points ahead of second-placed Gent. One match remained of the regular campaign in the 16-club division before the end of season play-off, when the top six sides usually compete to decide the champions and qualification for European football.
