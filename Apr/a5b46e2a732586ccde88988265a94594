 VILLARREAL winger Samuel Chukwueze has suggested that he is open to a future transfer to Chelsea. Having contributed 12 goals from 67 appearances for Villarreal in all competitions, the 20-year-old has been heavily linked with a future move to the Premier League. Although the Nigerian has previously missed out on a switch to Arsenal, the attacker has revealed that one of their London rivals are his “favourite team” in England. Speaking on Instagram Live, Chukwueze said: “My favourite team in England is Chelsea. I was supporting Chelsea when I was young. “When Chelsea lost that Champions League final against Manchester United, I was crying all through the night.” Having recently penned a contract extension, Chukwueze is now tied to Villarreal until 2023.
