 The Minister of Power, Engr. Saleh Mamman has said that the Federal Government has not taken any decision on the supply of free electricity from the 11 Electricity Distribution Companies (DisCos). In his twitter handle , he explained that the government would make the announcement officially when it takes the decision to provide free electricity to customers.
He tweeted: “Please Note: NO DECISION has been taken by the Federal Government to provide Nigerian free ELECTRICITY for 2 months. If and when that becomes a reality , it shall be announced officially.”
“Be rest assured that FG is exploring ways to ameliorate any hardship on Nigerians. ” The DisCos had through their umbrella body, Association of Nigeria Electricity Distributors (ANED ), announced it was ready to support the Federal Government initiative to provide Nigerians two months electricity to cushion the effects of the COVID -19 on the citizenry. But when the story went viral that the DisCos were to offer free electricity, they swiftly explained that the provision of free energy was subject to the government’s approval. The DisCos have insisted that the offer is a government initiative that power distributors are only promising to support. The DisCos have described themselves as buyers and sellers of electricity and not charity outfits that should supply power free of charge.
