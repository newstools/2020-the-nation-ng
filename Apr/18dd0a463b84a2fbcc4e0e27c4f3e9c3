From Onimisi Alao, Yola  The Adamawa State Government has received bags of rice and beans as COVID-19 palliative from the Federal Government. The items in total, for both Adamawa and Taraba, included 5,400 bags of parboiled rice (50kg), smaller quantities of other varieties of rice, and 50 100kg bags of beans. The commodities were parked in six trucks for delivery to Adamawa and Taraba states. The Adamawa/Taraba Command of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) handed the commodities during a ceremony at the Zonal Headquarters of the Command in Yola to the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development which in turn presented Adamawa’s share on behalf of the Federal Government to the Adamawa State Government. The Director of Humanitarian Services in the ministry, Grema Ali Alhaji, said the presentation of the items was in line with Federal Government’s directive to provide palliative to the citizens to cushion the effect of lockdown necessitated by the COVID-19 outbreak. The Adamawa State Deputy Governor, Chief Crowther Seth who received the items on behalf of the state government, commended the federal government for the gesture. Chief Seth said the Government of Ahmadu Fintiri is mindful of the current challenges and steps had been taken to curtail the spread of coronavirus in the state. He, however, debunked speculation that the state government has received 50 trucks of rice from federal government as palliative, describing it as false and malicious. He said the three trucks of mostly assorted rice products issued by the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), is the first consignment received by the state from the Federal Government.
