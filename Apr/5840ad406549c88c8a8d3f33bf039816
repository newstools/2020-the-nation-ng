The party then acknowledged with pride the energy and commitment with which Comrade Oshiomhole has been propagating the mantra of “One Man, One Vote”, even before joining party politics. The statement commended the team work spirit of Oshiomole which it noted helped to ensure the renewal of the party’s presidential mandate in the 2019 elections, adding that the Chairman has displayed high sense of committment to the strengthen of democratic structures and participatory politics with utmost fidelity to the best practices and in line with the party’s constitution. “It is on record how the National Chairman effectively mobilised leaders, members and apparatus of our great party to ensure the emergence of the current leadership of the National Assembly, a development which, in no small measures, has smoothened the engagement between the executive and legislative arms and enhance governance processes. “While wishing our Comrade Chairman many more years of exemplary service to our party and our nation, we wish him a happy birthday and many happy returns.
