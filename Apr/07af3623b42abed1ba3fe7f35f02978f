 PRESIDENT of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Rev. Supo Ayokunle, yesterday urged Christians to start seven days prayer for 30 minutes to curb the spread of the dreaded Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. In a statement he issued in Abuja, Ayokunle hailed Christians for the show of love and adherence to government and medical advice to avoid the spread of COVID-19. He said: “I must sincerely thank you for the exceptional leadership qualities with which you organised the churches under you to participate in the 24-hour prayer chain declared by our association last week. It is my prayer that the good Lord will answer our supplications upon our nation and also send us reprieve soon in Jesus’ name. I am extremely overwhelmed by the cooperation and responsiveness. “Soon after that prayer, the Lord ministered strongly to my spirit that we should take a step further in winning the battle over many challenges facing our nation and the church in Nigeria, especially, the present rampaging COVID-19 pandemic by using Paul and Silas’ praise approach (Acts. 16: 25-26) to provoke further divine intervention. As you know, God inhabits the praises of His people (Psalms 22: 3). Praise is the big gun of faith which when triggered can accomplish a lot in the spiritual realm. “In view of the foregoing, I therefore enjoin all Christian families to set aside 30 minutes each day for the next seven days to praise the beauty of God’s holiness with effect from Monday, April 20 to Sunday, April 26, 2020. “I will be relying upon the Holy Spirit and your responsible leadership in coordinating this just like you did during the last prayer chain. I believe that if we do this with one accord, God will do something very positive soon for us, not only by wiping away the global COVID-19 pandemic, but also by helping us to overcome other challenges facing our dear country and the body of Christ in Nigeria.”
