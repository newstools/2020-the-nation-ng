We pray they release him sound and safe. “We don’t want to lose such an illustrious son and we are begging the Governor Kayode Fayemi and the security team to rescue him alive,” the source said. Police spokesman Abutu Sunday said they were neither aware of any ransom demand by the abductors noe negotiations with the kidnappers. But he said that every security measure would be put in place to ensure Olabode regain freedom.
