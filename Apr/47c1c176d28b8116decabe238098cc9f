 Some 270, final year and postgraduate students have been mailed reading resources for research methodology to aid their preparation for project writing amid the lockdown. Mr. Ibraheem Kanmi, founder of Cashcow Group, announced the largesse on his twitter handle, calling on the students to send their email addresses to receive the materials. He told The Nation that he was inspired to give the materials as his contribution to providing solutions to problems facing education. “I chose to be a Solution Provider and Problem Solver, thus my Passion and specialty is to help people solve their problems and Nigerians are my primary target. “My intention was to give out to only 100 students hoping that each beneficiary will also forward to 20 students among their colleagues but I discovered many people have interest in the documents, so at the end, I expanded the range and was able to send the documents to 270 recipients,” he said.  Kanmi said the students would learn about the fundamental principles and process of research work, including: “research methodology, research methods, data collection techniques, data processing techniques, and how to make appropriate data presentation through accurate research design” from the seven textbooks, journals and power point slides he said to them. The finance and investment expert who also trains SME operators to manage their businesses, said he chose to share knowledge on research methodology to reach out to students irrespective of their programmes of study. “Initially I wanted to make it a video class for management science students and post it on YouTube but I thought it would be partial because students from other departments will not benefits in that initiative. Then I chose Research Methodology as the first exercise which I envisaged will surely applicable to all disciplines,” he said. Kanmi spoke of plans to provide content for freshers as well on a platform which he hopes he gets support to build.
