FORMER Bayern Munich forward and brother of the club’s chairman Michael Rummenigge believes Manchester City could sell winger Leroy Sane for as little as £44m when the transfer window reopens. Bayern have long held an interest in the 24-year-old, whose contract at City expires in June 2021. Sane has missed the entirety of this season so far after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury in the Community Shield last August. Rummenigge believes the compounding factors around Sane’s injury, contractual situation and the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic could lead to the Germany international being available at a “bargain price”.  “Bayern would have bought him for £87-105m before the cruciate ligament rupture, an obligation could now be significantly cheaper and maybe only cost £44m,” he wrote in his column, via Sport Bild. Further uncertainty around the future of City’s stars has been stoked by the club’s potential two-year Champions League ban due to violating Fifa’s Financial Fair Play system. “Sane’s contract with Manchester City ends in 2021, after which he would be free of charge,” Rummenigge continued. “If the European Cup lock for City persists, this club will also need money at some point in times of coronavirus to pay its salaries.
