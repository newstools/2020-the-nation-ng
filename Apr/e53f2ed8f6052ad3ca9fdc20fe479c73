Three pastors were on Sunday arrested in Warri, Delta State for holding Easter services. One of the clerics reportedly had over 100. This is coming in spite of the ongoing lockdown across the state to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. The defaulting churches are St James Anglican Church, Ojabugbe, All Saints Anglican Church, Airport Road and Christ For the World Mission, Daudu Street, all in Warri. Two of the arrested clergymen claimed their services were not held to full capacity. It was gathered 20 persons were arrested alongside the pastors. Prior to Sunday, the social media had been flooded with controversial directives attributed to the state government that the stay-at-home order will be relaxed for Christian worshipers to mark the annual fête. However, Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, on his verified Twitter handle reemphasised the lockdown order, disclosing that a third person at the state’s capital, Asaba, had tested positive for Coronavirus. Okowa tweeted, “The confirmation of this third case further reinforces our call for social distancing and a lockdown. All Christians should worship at home tomorrow.” The state commissioner for information, Mr. Charles Aniagwu had also debunked rumoured reports that the lockdown will be lifted for the Easter celebrations in churches.
