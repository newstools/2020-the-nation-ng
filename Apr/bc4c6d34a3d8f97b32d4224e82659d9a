 Residents of Lagasa Phase 2, a community in the Ibeju-Lekki area of Lagos state, have cried out for help as they beg the Eko Electric Distribution Company (EKEDC) to restore electricity supply to the area which has been in total blackout for more than one year. Chairman of Lagasa Phase 2 Community Development Association (CDA), Engr. Taiwo Musa, in an interview with The Nation on the need for EKEDC to connect the community to the national grid, said the CDA had to contribute money to purchase a new transformer over a year ago.  According to Engr. Musa, the association recently purchased a 500kva transformer to serve Cele Yoruba, Ajose and Itansanmole Streets before but it blew up due to overloading. “And for the past six months, the area has been in total darkness. We reported the case to EKEDC but nothing had been done. Each house within the CDA contributed 20,000 naira which amounts to 20 million naira that was used to purchase the transformers,” he explained. The CDA has implored EKEDC to connect the transformers.
