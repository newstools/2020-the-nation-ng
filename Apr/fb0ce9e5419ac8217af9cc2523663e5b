 IMO State government has set up task forces in each of the 27 local government areas in the state with 28 brand new ambulances procured for the control of coronavirus. The governor disclosed this when he formally launched an aggressive response to the COVID -19 free Imo Isolation  centre in Owerri. According to the governor, the health-saving facilities are expected to take care of emergency situations posed by the virus, even as world-class medical doctors had been engaged to man hospitals in the state. He said that the isolation centres had been sited at Okigwe General Hospital, Aboh Mbaise General Hospital; Imo University Teaching Hospital,  Orlu;  Federal Medical Centre,  Owerri  and state Specialist Hospital, Umuguma, adding that a molecular laboratory had been set up to test other viruses. The governor said: “With the six isolation centres and for the state to win the war against the disease, the people  must respect and obey all policies and programmes put in place by the state government  to ensure that the disease does not exist in the state”. He said the state government would continue to take proactive measures to ensure the safety and security of the people. Uzodinma added that the state government would henceforth review its policies on COVID-19 on a weekly basis whenever the need arises,  relax and tighten up as the situation might warrant. He bemoaned the hardship facing the masses and directed members of the state task force on COVID-19 to identify critical sectors for necessary assistance from the state government.
