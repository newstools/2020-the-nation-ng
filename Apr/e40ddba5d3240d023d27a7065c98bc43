The I-G had therefore, directed Commissioners of Police (CPs) in states to ensure strict compliance with the order during the Easter celebration. Adamu extends his felicitation with the Christian Community in Nigeria as they commemorate the crucifixion, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. He called on religious leaders in Lagos, Ogun and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) as well as other states affected by the restriction orders, to continue to cooperate with relevant government agencies.
