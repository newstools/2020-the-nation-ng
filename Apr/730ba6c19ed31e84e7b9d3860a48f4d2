Leicester City icon Steve Walsh believes Brendan Rodgers’ influence over the Foxes’ youngest players has been clear for all to see over recent months at King Power Stadium and he however, singled out Wilfred Ndidi as a key player for Rodgers’ side. Before the Premier League’s suspension, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, City sat third in the Premier League standings, eight points clear of fifth-placed Manchester United. A campaign which has included Club records for biggest home and away Premier League victories and an eight-game winning run has delighted Walsh, a Fox between 1986 and 2000. The two-time League Cup winner believes the management of Northern Irishman Rodgers, in his first full season on Filbert Way, has been a key factor behind Leicester’s excellent performances. The Foxes hero picked out several players for individual praise, including Ndidi alongside experienced centre-back Jonny Evans, whom he said have been vitally important figures for Rodgers’ men. “Wilfred Ndidi, up until his injury, was the key to everything for Leicester in the heart of that midfield. You just always feel assured when he’s on the team sheet. “Then there’s experienced players like Kasper Schmeichel and Jamie Vardy, they’ve both been incredible for Leicester, especially Vardy, who’s still the league’s top goal scorer. Also, Ndidi has admitted that the team did not miss Harry Maguire, joined Manchester United for a world record fee for a defender in August last year. The Nigerian believes manager Rodgers is the reason the club aren’t missing Maguire. And Ndidi thinks that Rodgers’ willingness to use all of his squad and afford chances to those on the periphery is the reason behind City doing so well after selling Maguire.
