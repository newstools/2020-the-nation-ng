An Abuja-based business woman and socialite, Mrs. Happiness Uyiota Kingsley, has apologised to the management of Monty Suites Hotels, Uyo over defamatory comments she made about the hotel in the social media. The woman popularly known as Arab Money had penultimate week, in a widely circulated video on social media platforms, warned some married women involving in extra marital affairs in the hotel to turn a new leaf or quit their marriages. The management of the hotel said the woman’s mention of the name of the hotel as centre for adulterous sexual affairs was defamatory as the action has allegedly put the corporate image of the hospitality outfit in disrepute. Though the hotel management, as at press time is yet to make any official statement on the matter, Arab money, in a letter addressed to the Managing director and Chief Executive Officer Monty Suites dated 18th April and obtained by journalists, expressed deep seated regret over the video. According to her: “That the statement identifying Monty Suites as a venue where some married women do go to have extra marital affairs is regretted and hereby withdrawn and same stands retracted bearing in mind that Monty Suite is a corporate hospitality and business outfit which has nothing to do with the unfortunate altercations I had with another woman.” Warning those who may want to use the referred video for any form of mischief, she added: “By this retraction, I take exception to any form of propaganda in relating to the said video as any person who want to use the said video to insult, traduce, defame the character of any person or corporate body, or intend to extort money from anyone using the said video does so at his/her own peril”. Sounding remorseful, Arab Mone said: “I regret all inconveniences and embarrassment this misidentification or mistake might have caused the management of Monty Suites, its esteemed customers, the good people of Akwa Ibom State and the general public”.
