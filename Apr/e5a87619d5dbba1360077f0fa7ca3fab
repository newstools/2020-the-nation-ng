Cristiano Ronaldo has moved into a breath-taking luxury villa on the island of Madeira near a quiet fishing village. The Juventus superstar, after nearly a month on the island of his birth, has decided to leave his £7m seven-storey home in Funchal and relocate his partner Georgina Rodriguez and his children. The 35-year-old has rented the villa for £3,500-a-week, with photos showing the luxuries he will enjoy during the coronavirus lockdown including a swimming pool, top-floor games room and six bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms. The residence also has a private gym, two kitchens and a playroom which Ronaldo’s four children can use.  There is also a living room with ample space, a dining area and TV as well as a barbecue area outside. The villa unsurprisingly comes with Wi-Fi included, basic kitchen and living amenities and free parking on the premises. Ronaldo has opted to move from his previous £7m residence in Funchal, the largest city on the island of Madeira. The 35-year-old posted a video on his Instagram on Wednesday of his new surroundings, as he and his girlfriend took it in turns to sprint up a steep incline. The caption alongside the video read: ‘My beautiful training partner! #stayactive #stayhome.’ Reportedly, Ronaldo is so keen to keep up his fitness regime that at one point he worked out at the Madeira national stadium, home of club C.D. Nacional.
