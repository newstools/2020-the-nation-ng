Former D’Tigers captain, Olumide Oyedeji has said that the need to spread the knowledge he acquired in his 20 years career made him reject a mouth-watering offer and stay in Nigeria. Oyedeji, who started his professional career in 1996 with the Nigeria Customs, said he got a £250,000.00 per annum offer to head the basketball operation of a foremost continental body three years ago but rejected it to continue his contribution to the development of basketball in Nigeria. In an online interview organised by Friends United by Sports (FUBS), Oyedeji said he had no regret rejecting the offer, noting that he would turn down the offer if presented with it again. “Well, I will do it over and over again. I had no regret about it. I was determined to come back home and spread the knowledge I acquired, connections made to impact the game,” stated the former Orlando Magic forward. “I had an offer of £250,000 salary per annum as a starting point, but I will never be in peace if I accepted that offer because I am more needed here (Nigeria). I love the money but to me money is not everything as I give glory to God because i am blessed,” he added. Oyedeji, who also had a stint with Ebun Comet in the Nigerian league before playing in Russia and Germany, said there are more Olumide Oyedejis emerging from the local scene. He noted there are talented players all over the country, stating that his desire is to put smiles on their faces. “I want to see more Nigerians out there.  I want to see smiles on those young faces. Basketball changed my life, basketball gave me name, fame and security, It has also made me what I am today. I will give everything to inspire and produce more Olumides. I know we have thousands of Olumide out there.”
