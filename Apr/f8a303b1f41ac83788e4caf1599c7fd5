His post read “#WCW I have always admired your talent and hard work but I have more respect for you now as a person. You made a mistake and you owned it. This takes courage and you have shown all of us that you are courageous. As humans, we must make mistakes. Only God is perfect. My prayer every day is that I don’t make a mistake that will cost me my life or reputation. You have made yours and the whole world has seen. Thankfully, it didn’t cost you your life or anyone else’s. Just tiny reputational damage that in my opinion, you have already restored because you have paid the price with jara on top. If you dey shame, stop am o, because as TuBaba talks, “nobody holy pass”. I pray that henceforth, you continue to be a good example that you have always been to us all. Amen. One more thing, I don dey act now o. Tenks! #IDJA cc @funkejenifaakindele” he wrote.
