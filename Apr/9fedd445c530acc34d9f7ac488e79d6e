The posed dangers by coronavirus pandemic have not passed despite the relaxation of lockdown ordered by President Muhammadu Buhari, on Monday, the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, has said. The PTF warned that the virus remained potent, virulent and dangerous. Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, stated these during the daily briefing of the PTF on Covid -19 on Tuesday in Abuja. Buhari, in a nationwide broadcast on Monday, ordered the easing of lockdown in Ogun and Lagos States, including the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja from Monday, May 4. Mustapha, who is the chairman of the PTF, urged Nigerians to be vigilant and careful as they embark on their daily activities. He said: “Ladies and gentlemen, the relaxation of the lockdown is to enable us gradually return to our daily lives but in a moderated manner. The COVID-19 pandemic has permanently altered our ways of life and we must begin to learn how to adjust to this new reality. “This relaxation does not in any way imply that the danger has passed. The virus is still potent, virulent and dangerous. We must remain very vigilant and careful. We must take responsibility for our actions. We must commit to a collective victory over COVID-19.” Mustapha implored Nigerians to continue to adhere to the restriction orders placed by the federal and some state governments. “Let me at this point inform you that the lockdown for FCT, Lagos and Ogun States shall remain in force till Midnight of Sunday 3rd May, 2020 after which the new regime of measures shall take effect. Law enforcement agencies shall, therefore, continue to enforce the restriction of movements,” he added.
