 PRIOR to the outbreak of Coronavirus disease(COVID-19), aspirants for 2023 poll had jumped the guns to feather their nest. The bitter politics almost cost the National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress(APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, his job. But since the outbreak of the pandemic, most of the 2023 aspirants have kept sealed lips and they have deserted the National Secretariat of the party before its closure. Some of the aspirants have relocated from Abuja to avoid undergoing COVID-19 test. A few ones in the National Assembly, who want to be governors, have resorted to discreet tests in private clinics to determine their status. A governorship aspirant in one of the states in the North, who spoke with our correspondent, said: “I have forgotten my ambition now; what I concentrate on is prayers against infection. With this COVID-19, I will prefer to live than to be a governor. This pandemic is real and it is spreading among the political  class, including heads of government, all over the world.”
