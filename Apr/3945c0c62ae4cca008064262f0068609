Osun State Governor Adegboyega Oyetola has launched a Joint Task Force (JTF) to combat kidnapping, cultism, illegal mining and other crimes. Addressing the residents on Tuesday at the state secretariat in Osogbo, the governor said the JTF is a collaboration of the Army, Police, Air Force, Department of State Service, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps and Nigeria Immigration Service, and it shall provide operational support for Amotekun to fight cultism, kidnapping, illegal mining and other crimes. He said: “Security for us is a comprehensive initiative, which includes economic, social, political and other spheres. Our social investment programmes such as employment for youths and credit facilities for our people are designed to empower them and eliminate crimes. Indeed, the inclusion of illegal mining as a component of the JTF is a proof that we take our economic and industrial initiatives seriously. “Security is critical to all we do as a government because it is only in an atmosphere of security and safety that our development agenda can be achieved and our outcomes protected. In furtherance of our huge investment in security as a way of achieving sustainable development, we shall fund the JTF to make it effective and functional.” Oyetola said achieving security is a collective responsibility and a path to attaining economic recovery and transformation for a sustainable, safe and prosperous state. He warned criminals, saying Osun State would not be a safe haven for them. “There is no hiding place for men of the underworld in this state. Today’s launch is, therefore, a warning to them to either leave Osun State or face the music.” The governor urged the JTF officials to eschew acts that could compromise its effectiveness and instead embrace their tasks with sense of patriotism, integrity, commitment and diligence. He advised them to work together as a team. Oyetola enjoined the residents to cooperate with the JTF.
