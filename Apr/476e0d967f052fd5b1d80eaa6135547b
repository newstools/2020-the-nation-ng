Bishop Olusola Odedeji of the Anglican Diocese of Lagos West has enjoined Nigerians to be of courage even as they confront the COVID-19 pandemic. In his Easter message delivered online on Sunday, he assured members of the church and indeed all Nigerians that the storm will soon be over. He said: “Easter is about the Lord’s resurrection. It is a message of hope, life, grace and victory. It is particularly appropriate for a time like this when the coronavirus is sweeping through the entire world; when death is literally walking on all four in the world; when able bodied men and women are being locked in their homes in many countries, including ours.” The Bishop added: “We should rejoice, realising that Christ triumphed over death. He paid the price on the cross. He made the perfect sacrifice.” He said Christians should realise that the resurrection is the cornerstone of Christianity, noting that they should hold on to the word of God because, as Apostle Paul said, every regenerated Christian lives in the Lord.
