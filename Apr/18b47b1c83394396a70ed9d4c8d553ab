 A body, Hengo Badagry Youth Association, has hailed the lawmaker representing Badagry Federal Constituency of Lagos State, Mr. Babatunde Hunpe, for his efforts over the resumption of fuel supply to filling stations in the constituency. The President, Mr. Felix Godonu, speaking at the weekend in Badagry during an interview, said over 150 communities in the area were affected following border closure and suspension of petrol supply to filling stations. Godonu said that it was through the assistance of the legislator that the Federal Government approved nine filling stations in Badagry to start receiving fuel, to reduce the hardship experienced by residents. He said: “This lockdown now witnessed by Lagosians is not strange to us in Badagry because since last August 21, when the border was partially closed and fuel supply to our filling stations was suspended, we had experienced lockdown.  “We have no industry, no company here. Eighty-five per cent of those earning their living here are licensed Customs agents. Since they closed the border, they had chased us out of businesses.” Godonu thanked the Federal Government for its magnanimity by allowing some filling stations to get petroleum products to supply to those communities. He urged the government to allow more filling stations in the area to supply petroleum products “because only nine stations are not enough for over 150 communities.”
