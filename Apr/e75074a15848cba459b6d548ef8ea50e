The Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC) and Transparency International (TI) has called on governments at all levels to show accountability of the utilisation and distribution of funds donated to the country by both public and private organisations in the country and beyond to combat the COVID-19 virus pandemic. This is as the organisations commended the ongoing donations by indigenous groups towards combating the spread of the disease in the country. CISLAC in a statement by its Exceutive Director, Mr Auwal Musa Rafsanjani, also applauded the recent constitution of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 response with specific responsibility to coordinate donations for efficient and impactful spending, but expressed surprise that the selection and appointment into the committee did not take cognisance of representatives from the media and other credible governmental and non-governmental organisations working on anti-corruption, transparency and accountability in governance and public financial management. He emphasised that in times of global public emergency, proactive measures to ensure judicious utilisation and distribution of these funds were needed more than ever. He hinted that inclusion of media and other accountability entities in the committee would compel transparency and accountability in the utilisation and dissemination of managed funds, stressing that Nigeria could not afford mismanagement and misappropriation of public and donated funds. He also declared that diversion or misappropriation of the funds by anyone at this time would be tantamount to total betrayal, unpatriotism and selfishness in the management of the nationâ€™s treasury, which they said were punishable under relevant laws.
