Activist-lawyer Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN) has described the late Chief Richard Akinjide (SAN) as a legal colossus and ‘forensic advocate’ who would be missed. He said in a statement: “I join millions of Nigerians to mourn Chief Richard Akinjide (SAN) a legal colossus, quintessential jurisprudential theoretician, a very brilliant Constitutional lawyer and political titan. He was once at home with friends as he was with enemies. He drew legal and political punches and took the same in equal or more measure. “Nigerians will never forget his creative interpretation of the constitutional provision of 12 -2/3 in ushering in the government of Alhaji Shehu Shagari. I was with him at the 2014 National Conference, where his vast intellect, gargantuan experience and deep knowledge of the law and politics easily played out. “As Attorney-General under Shagari, he ensured some relief to those sentenced to death by execution. He was a complete Barman, astute political strategist and an uncommon forensic advocate. May his patriotic Nigerian soul rest in peace.”
