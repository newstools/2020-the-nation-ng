As part of efforts to prevent new cases of COVID-19 from other states, Kaduna State has converted the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) orientation camp on the Kaduna-Abuja highway into a quarantine centre for travellers. The government, last week, announced that any traveller insisting on coming into or pass through Kaduna, would be sent to one of its quarantine facilities for 14 days. Deputy Governor Dr Hadiza Balarabe confirmed the temporary conversion of the NYSC camp during an inspection visit to the facilityÂ  on Thursday. Dr Balarabe who was in company of other members of the Covid-19 Task Force in Kaduna, explained that the facility would be used to quarantine travellers coming into the state during the lockdown, as part of measures to contain the further spread of coronavirus.
