 THE index case of COVID-19 in Delta State came from Canada two months ago, Delta Information Commissioner, Mr Charles Aniagwu has said. Aniagwu said ongoing investigation and contact tracing of persons who had contact with the index case will reveal if the patient entered the state with the virus. Aniagwu, disclosed this on a live chat on the Africa Independent Television (AIT) on Thursday. He said the state government has commenced contact tracing for the index case, saying that there was no cause for alarm as the patient was already receiving best of treatment from its medical team. His words, “We are not having much difficulty. We have been able to secure his cooperation and he is responding very well to treatment. “In tracing it, we first of all limit it to the environment where he had been for a very long time. He has been in the country for about two months now. He came from Canada.”
