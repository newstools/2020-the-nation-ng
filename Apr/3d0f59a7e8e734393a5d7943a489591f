Undefeated Cuban heavyweight boxer Frank Sanchez is hoping to line up a shot at Anthony Joshua’s WBO title, but his manager doesn’t expect the Brit to be champion. The 27-year-old burst into the top ten of the WBO rankings with his 15th straight win after beating Joey Dawejko on points last month. Joshua meanwhile has been ordered to face Oleksandr Usyk, though Sanchez’s manager Mike Barao has told Sky Sports that he doubts Joshua can meet his WBO commitments and will in fact vacate the championship belt. He said: ‘Just a guess but I think Usyk ends up winning a vacated WBO heavyweight title within the next 12 months. ‘Frank is in good position to fight for the WBO championship, in the event that occurs.  ‘I believe Frank Sanchez versus WBO number 6 Junior Fa or number seven Michael Hunter would make sense.’ Joshua holds the WBO belt, along with the WBA ‘super’ and IBF titles after beating Andy Ruiz Jr in their rematch in December. The British boxer was ordered to make title defences against Kubrat Pulev and Usyk, but opted to face the Bulgarian. Sanchez meanwhile has been exploding through the competition so far and is seeking an eliminator fight against Fa or Hunter. Fa has been named as a possible next opponent for Joseph Parker who stands at number two in the WBO rankings. Hunter though has yet to return to the ring since his fight with Alekander Povetkin ended up a draw back in December.
