 Nollywood actor and producer, Muyiwa Ademola has enjoined Nigerians to pay more attention to people with special needs. The actor made this call on his social media page while reacting to a movie he recently watched during the lockdown. “Please if you have people with special needs, pay more attention to them, they are the most loving, the most loyal and the most sincere”, Ademola wrote. “Hnmmm….. Miracle in cell No 7. There has been so much talk about this Netflix film recently. Almost everyone that saw it said they shed tears.  People keep telling me I wouldn’t escape it if I watch it. I kept picking dates to see it and change it without any hindrance but just to escape this “You will cry if you watch it” prophesy. “I watched it today! I didn’t drop tears, I wept! At a point I totally forgot it was a movie. Without exaggerating, I tear-soaked two handkerchiefs before grabbing a towel.” Muyiwa Ademola is known for his great interpretation of roles in movies having featured in several blockbusters including his breakthrough movie Ori in 2005.
