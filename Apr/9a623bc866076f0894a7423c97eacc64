 The Coronavirus pandemic has led to the cancelation of a Guinness World Record programme at the University of Ilorin (UNILORIN). The Guinness World Record Hackathon innovation on Renewable Energy to feature 5,000 students across Kwara State participating in a technology training was scheduled to hold March 21 but had to be postponed till further notice in deference to the Federal Government’s directive to observe social distancing as a measure to curb the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Explaining the cancellation, Director of UNILORIN Renewable Energy Centre (UREC), Prof. Joshua Olaoye, said: “To gather 5,000 students in a single venue negates the current Federal Government of Nigeria campaign against public gathering of more than 50 people”.  “Information gathered from our foreign partners and their government agencies, Guinness World Record (GWR), Hackathon TechChallenge and Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had clearly indicated that gathering of 50 or more people should be cancelled for eight weeks. “Against these aforementioned issues, UREC, therefore, wishes to announce the indefinite postponement of our programme, World Record project and Hackathon TechChallenge, tagged: Kwara-UNILORIN Innovation Hackathon,” he said.
