 A MOBILE court in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) yesterday convicted an Islamic cleric and other worshippers who gathered for  congregational prayers. Their gathering was ruled to be in defiance of the lockdown order   declared to keep the coronavirus pandemic at bay. The cleric, Malam Isa Ismail and two others were arrested at a popular Mosque in Wuse 2 District for  organising prayers in a manner that put public health at risk. The three convicts were fined N2,000 each and will do 24 hours of community service. Up to 500 violators have been convicted, and impounded several vehicles. He called on residents to stop undermining government’s efforts  at curtailing the spread of  COVID-19, saying the killer virus is  not a  respecter of persons nor religion. His words: “The FCTA mobile court sitting at Eagle Square today convicted an Imam of a popular Mosque in Wuse 2 District for holding worship in contravention of the lockdown rules. “Imam Isa Ismail and two other worshippers were convicted and fined N2,000 each with community service. They will be cleaning the neighbourhood for 24 hours, to serve as deterrent to others. “Several motorists were also arrested and arraigned before the mobile court. Since the mobile courts started sitting,  about 500 violators have been convicted. Many of them were fined and released after paying the fines. “Based on the discretion of the court, the convicted violators were fined and released,  because sending them to Correctional Centres would undermine government’s efforts towards decongestin Centres and other detention facilities across the country. Moreso,  many of the convicts were first time offenders”.
