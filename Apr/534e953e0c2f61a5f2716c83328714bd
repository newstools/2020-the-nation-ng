Outside Minna, the Niger State capital, there is little regard for the lockdown ordered by the state government to curb spread of the coronavirus. The defiant residents say Covid-19 is a white man’s disease and cannot catch them. A lot of the communities in Shiroro and Paikoro local government areas of the state have gone about their normal businesses, refusing to comply with the lockdown. A visit to Paikoro town, Guni, and Gwada in Shiroro local government area also revealed that there was no security presence in these communities. This is different from Minna where there are over 23 checkpoints to enforce the lockdown order. Abu Usman in Guni said, “We do not have the virus here and as such, we go about our normal businesses without interruption.”
