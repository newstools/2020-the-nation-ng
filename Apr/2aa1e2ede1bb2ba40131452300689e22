THE World Health Organisation (WHO) and European soccer governing-body, UEFA, are seemingly now at loggerheads over the resumption of football amid on-going battle to contain the scourge of Coronavirus. According to Italian paper La Repubblica, the WHO have reportedly called for all football to be suspended until the end of next season – 2021. It is understood that the organisation would prefer all matches to be axed until at least the end of next season, in 18 months’ time. WHO are said to be considering all possible scenarios, but are concerned about causing a second wave of the pandemic. A lengthy suspension could plunge a huge number of clubs into financial instability due to the lack of matchday income. Teams across the world have already called on their players to take a pay cut to help ease their cash woes. But UEFA has categorically denied that the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommended to them this week that all international competition should be suspended until the end of 2021. The governing body have been discussing with their 55 member associations a range of issues that are affecting football including the restructuring of the football calendar. A UEFA spokesperson said: “This is not correct. WHO never recommended that football should no longer be played until the end of 2021.” The WHO is acting as the lead United Nations (UN) body that advises a number of sporting federations during the Coronavirus pandemic.
