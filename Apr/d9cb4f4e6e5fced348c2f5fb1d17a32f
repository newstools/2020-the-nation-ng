Ernest Nwokolo, Abeokuta Hope rises on Thursday for possible return of peace to the crisis-ridden People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun State with Senator Buruji Kashamu declaring that he was ready for genuine reconciliation with the aggrieved members of the party in the state. Kashamu, however, said such reconciliation would not be midwifed by Dayo Bayo (suspended chairman) and Semiu Sodipo(suspended Secretary) as they lacked both authority and legitimacy to do so, having allegedly became “mercenaries” for their paymaster against the wellbeing of Ogun PDP. The Senator in a release he signed, said the State Executive Committee in collaboration with leaders and elders at the wards, Local Government and State levels remained the one that could foster a genuine reconciliation capable of standing the test of time and the law. Kashamu who noted that he had the mandate of all the altruistic leaders and elders of the Party to declare the readiness and availability for genuine reconciliation to reposition Ogun PDP and move it forward, said he harbours no interest in any elective office in future and had no reason to oppose the ambition of anybody. ” I have the mandate of all the altruistic leaders and elders of the Party in Ogun State to declare once again that we are willing, ready and available for genuine reconciliation that will reposition our Party and move it forward,” Kashamu said.
