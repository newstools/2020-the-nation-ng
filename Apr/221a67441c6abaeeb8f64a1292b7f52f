 No fewer than 300 youths have benefited from Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Oluâ€™s food relief stimulus in Isolo Local Government Council Development Area (LCDA) of Lagos. The state government food package was received on Monday by a three-man committee made up of the Secretary of the council, Kolawole Olojede; Leader of the Legislative Arm, Remmy Shittu Remmy and CDC Treasurer, Saheed Olanrewaju. The food relief stimulus which contained 300 food packs was distributed to youths in Alagbeji ward amidst wild jubilation and praises for the governor. The remaining six wards are slated to benefit from the stimulus package put together by the state government to cushion the effect of Convid19 stay-at-home order. (NAN)
