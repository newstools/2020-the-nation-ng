 A group under the aegis of the North East Youth Progressive Forum has described former governor of  Lagos State and National Leader of the All Progressive Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu as a fearless leader whose  advocate for democracy forced him into compulsory exile in Benin Republic in 1994. The group  said the then Head of State, General Abdulsalam Abubakar, who held the baton of power after death of Gen. Sani Abacha asked the Lagos politician  to return to the country due to his bravery. A member of the group, Adamu Hassan, who spoke  on behalf of the group leader in Bauchi, the state capital while eulogising the National Leader who recently celebrated his 68 birthday, said his political influence is not only felt  in the South West, but virtually across the six geo-political zones in the country. Hassan said the  group has every confidence, that the former governor of Lagos State will play greater roles in the future.  ” Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, an advocate of democracy and true nationalists, a chartered course which in 1994 forced him to a compulsory exile to Benin Republic and later United Kingdom. He is also an advocate of national unity, building bridges across the various ethnic tribes in the country, while patching-up warring factions among dissimilar Nigerians,” he said Hassan added that ” Tinubu’s political influence has permeated into not only South West, but virtually each and every geo-political zone, with his tentacles spreading across the nooks and crannies of the country. ”We have every confidence that the Lagos-born politician of national repute, will carry the APC presidential flag ahead of the 2023 general elections”a
