As part of the activities to celebrate the Easter, all Parishes under the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), LP 17, Dunamis Zone is giving out foodstuff such as Beans, Garri and Onions as palliative and stimulus package to the church members and members of the community. This, according to the statement is based on the directive of the mission of The Redeemed Christian Church of God on the Let’s Go-A-Fishing programme scheduled from Friday 10th to Monday 13th April, 2020, which stated that it should be observed at parish levels in form of Welfare/Social-Relief Programme.  “This is as a result of the prevailing lockdown and restrictions caused by the pre-cautionary measures against Covid-19”. The foodstuff were packed moderately and the aim is to ensure that Dunamis Zone and all it parishes is able to reach out to all households within the church locations and its environs This gesture went a long way, especially considering the lockdown situation in the country.
