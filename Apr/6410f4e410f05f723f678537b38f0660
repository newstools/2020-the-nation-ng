The House of Representatives has alleged that the Presidency may be deliberately hiding information concerning the National Social Investment Programmes (NSIPs), especially the National Conditional Cash Transfer Programme, from the National Assembly. This allegation was made by the spokesman for the House of Representatives, Mr. Benjamin Kalu, in a statement at the weekend. Kalu was responding to what he called a ”misleading and slanderous publications of Madam Maryam Uwais, the Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on NSIPs, in an online medium. He said Uwais had refused to provide information on the programme to the House before, adding that her refusal to be forthcoming with information on the programme “suggests a deliberate attempt to conceal information pertaining to the financial activities of NSIP from the elected representatives of Nigerians.” Kalu recalled “that she blatantly ignored a letter of enquiry from the House Committee on Public Account addressed to her in her capacity as the Special Assistant to the President on NSIP….” His statement reads: “Our attention has been drawn to the misleading and slanderous publications of Madam Maryam Uwais and Sahara Reporters both published on April 8, regarding the implementation of the National Social Investment Programmes (NSIPs), the National Conditional Cash Transfer Programme, including the development of the National Social Register (NSR). “The insinuations in the above mentioned publications that the 9th House of Representatives labelled the NSIPs as a failure and a scam are incorrect and untrue. So also are the insinuations that the 9th House of Representatives has sought to compromise the NSR and input the names of undeserving Nigerians as beneficiaries of the programmes.
