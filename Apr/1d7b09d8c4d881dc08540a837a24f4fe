 OPERATIVES of the Nigerian Navy Ship (NNS) DELTA have destroyed three illegal refining sites with 42 ovens, 55 receivers and 60 surface metal storage tanks at Bennett Island, Delta State. Naval operatives in Delta and Rivers States also uncovered illegal refineries where vandals had thousands of illegal refined AGO, DPK as well as stolen crude oil socked, the Defence Media Operations Centre (DMOC) said. Coordinator of the centre Maj.Gen. John Enenche said the sites were discovered during anti-Crude Oil Theft (COT) and illegal bunkering operations carried out by the navy in collaboration with Ocean Marine Service (OMS). He said the operations commenced following recent discoveries that some illegal refineries earlier destroyed were being reactivated. Enenche said the NN deployed two swamp buggies to Bennett Island from April 7, adding that the team deactivated 24 ovens, 35 receivers and 25 surface metal storage tanks and covered one dug out pit that day. “Additionally, on April 8, the team located another illegal refining site at Bennett Island. During the operation, 14 ovens, 20 receivers and 21 surface metal storage tanks were dismantled. Similarly, on April 10, the combined team of NNS DELTA and OMS surveillance crew commenced the swamp buggy operation at Bennett Island in Warri South LGA of Delta State. “The team located an illegal refining site and deactivated four ovens, 14 surface metal storage tanks and five coolers. Furthermore, the team discovered an illegal valve connection along the Trans-Forcados pipeline suspected to have been connected by pipeline vandals. The valve and associated fittings were disconnected and recovered to the OMS Houseboat at Yeye.”
