As part of efforts to jumpstart the economy, which has received a hit by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Akwa Ibom State Government is set to name members of a Post COVID-19 Economic Recovery Committee. According to Commissioner of Information, Charles Udoh, the committee, which will be announced next week, will be saddled with the responsibility to come up with practical strategies necessary to re-invigorate the economy. He mentioned the proactive steps of setting up the committee would put Akwa Ibom ahead in terms of economic recovery, explaining because no economy has been spared the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, “the reasonable route to go is for political leaders to put on their economic thinking caps for quick recovery.” Udoh observed the concern of Governor Udom Emmanuel for welfare and survival of Akwa Ibom economy prompted his desire to set up the committee early enough. He assured the state government would always work in the interest of all citizens and residents of Akwa Ibom State. He appealed that everyone should continue to stay safe by observing the necessary precautions and obey the lockdown order to avoid contracting the coronavirus.
