TThe Nigerian insurance industry has provided live insurance cover for a maximum number of 5000 health workers on the frontline in the fight against the coronavirus (COVID-19), to the tune of N112,500,000 premium. The Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) and Chairman of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on (COVID-19) Pandemic, Mr Boss Mustapha, disclosed this yesterday during the daily press briefing by the task force in Abuja. According to him, the premium in total had been fully paid by the insurance industry. He therefore charged all health workers on the frontline to redouble their commitment to the fight to save Nigeria from the virus. He thanked operators of the industry for coming out to be counted among those who have contributed to the campaign against COVID-19 in Nigeria. He also charged other sectors of the economy to also come out to support the campaign. Mustapha said: “I am however pleased to inform you that in addition to what the Federal Government is doing, the insurance industry has responded massively to the call for support. “The PTF has received the life insurance cover to the frontline workers on COVID-19 for a maximum of 5,000 health workers who are employed to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. “The premium in the sum of N112,500,000 for the cover has been fully paid by the Nigerian Insurance Industry in line with the principle of no premium, no cover. “The PTF wishes to thank the insurance industry immensely and calls on others sectors of the economy to rise up to support the efforts to fight COVID-19. “I also call on our frontline health workers to double their efforts just as we assure them of our determination to protect them,” he said.
