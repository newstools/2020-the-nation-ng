From Eric Ikhilae, Abuja  A Federal High Court in Abuja has rejected the request by the Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) for the revocation of the bail granted Chairman of the defunct Pension Reform Task Team (PRTT), Abdulrasheed Maina. The EFCC had, in a motion on notice, claimed that Maina, being tried on money laundering related charges, had perfected plan to escape from custody and assassinate the prosecuting lawyer and prosecution’s witnesses. In a ruling on Wednesday, Justice Okon Abang held that it was premature for the court to take a definite position on the issue because there is evidence before the court that the allegation by the prosecution has been established by any security agency. Justice Abang said the request to revoke Maina’s bail was premature because he believes that investigation of the allegations has not been concluded since Maina claimed he has not been questioned by any security agency on the issue. The judge also rejected the EFCC’s request for an order directing that more security measure be put in place around Maina, currently being held at the Kuje correctional centre, Abuja. Justice Abang noted that, since the Executive arm controls all the security agencies and the prosecuting agency, it could easily provide additional security if it feels such measure was necessary, without any order of the court.
