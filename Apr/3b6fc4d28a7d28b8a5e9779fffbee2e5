The House of Representatives said on Friday that the decision of President Muhammadu Buhari to grant pardon to about 2,600 inmates will reduce the burden on personnel of the Nigeria Correctional Service and go a long way in decongesting the Custodian Centres. Chairman of the House Committee on Reformatory Institutions, Rep. Anayo Edwin, in a statement, said the President’s gesture was commendable. Edwin had asked stakeholders in the administration of criminal justice in Nigeria to urgently consider and carry out jail delivery and adopt more libral bail conditions for Awaiting Trial Men (ATM) to decongest custodial centres in the wake of the protest by inmates of Kaduna centre over fears of Covid 19 infestation. The lawmaker expressed appreciation to Buhari for responding swiftly to the call, adding that the President’s gesture will reduce the work load of the officers, improve the welfare of inmates and reduce the possibilities and fears of outbreak of the deadly coronavirus at the custodial centres across the country. The lawmaker asked Governors to emulate Buhari by urgently granting pardon to certain categorise of convicts and those standing trial for state offences, as that will help to further decongest the custodial centres. He expressed belief that such action will help the country recover from the onerous challenge, which the possible spread of COVID- 19 to any of the centres may pose on the country. The committee chairman stated the ninth House of Representatives under the leadership of Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila, remains committed to the improvement of the Nigeria Correctional Service, including the welfare of staff and inmates. He pledged that the House will continue to support every effort of the executive arm of government geared towards the repositioning of the country’s reformatory institutions.
