A global entertainment organisation, Zulu Republic, has donated food items and cash to orphanages and old people’s home in Delta State. The Chief Executive Officer, Frank Dievbiere, presented the items to Our Lady’s Old People’s Home, Warri, and St. Ann’s Orphanage, Airport Junction, Effurun. He was represented by members of the organisation. According to him, the stay-at-home order had led to fear of hunger, especially among vulnerable persons. He enjoined Nigerians and Deltans to comply with directives to contain the virus. One of the members, Daro Ometta, said while the organisation was basically into entertainment management, alleviating hunger would help the current situation. He said: “Zulu Republic decided to give this donation to support people during this pandemic. Nobody expected the pandemic to happen, but we have to think of the old people and less-privileged…” Ometta urged the people to imbibe safety measures, such as social distancing, use of face masks, washing of hands and applying sanitisers to contain the virus. Matron of St. Ann’s Orphanage Rev. Sis. Immaculata Onyenakasa, who received the items, thanked Zulu entertainment for the gesture and prayed God to bless the organisation.
