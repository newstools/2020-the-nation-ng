British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who spent the night in intensive care with a deteriorating case of coronavirus, has been given oxygen but is not on a ventilator, a minister said Tuesday. “The prime minister has received some oxygen support,” senior cabinet minister Michael Gove told LBC radio, adding that “he has not been on a ventilator” but it was there if needed. He was diagnosed with the Coronavirus on March 26, and moved to an intensive care unit of a London hospital after his condition worsened o Monday. Johnson had been quarantined in his Downing Street residence since being diagnosed with COVID-19 on March 26 but continued to preside at daily meetings on the outbreak until Sunday. The 55-year-old, who was admitted on Sunday evening for tests after continuing to suffer a cough and high temperature, has asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to deputize for him where necessary. Raab said Johnson was “in safe hands” at the hospital, which is treating many virus patients.
