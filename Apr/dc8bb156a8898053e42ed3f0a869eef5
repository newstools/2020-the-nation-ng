 Two brothers, Segun Adeola, 20 and Abraham Adeola, 18, were, on Wednesday, arraigned before an Ado-Ekiti Chief Magistrates’ Court over alleged conspiracy to steal a cell phone. The defendants, whose addresses were unknown, are facing a charge of conspiracy to steal. The Prosecutor, Insp. Oriyomi Akinwale, told the court that the defendants committed the offence on April 27, at about 7:30 am. at Surulere street, Omisanjana in Ado-Ekiti. He alleged that the defendants conspired to steal a cell phone belonging to one Tope Awata. Akinwale said the two brothers went to Awata’s house to steal his phone through the window, but that they were caught by the complainant. Akinwale said that the offence contravened Section 516 of the Criminal Code, Laws of Ekiti State, 2012. The prosecutor asked the court for adjournment to enable him to study the case file and present his witnesses. The defendants, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge preferred against them. The Defence Counsel, Mr Kehinde Ogunmodede, urged the court to grant the defendants bail, promising that they would not jump bail. The Chief Magistrate, Mrs Olanike Adegoke, granted the defendants bail in the sum of N50,000, with one surety each in like sum. She, thereafter, adjourned the case till June 3, for mention. (NAN)
