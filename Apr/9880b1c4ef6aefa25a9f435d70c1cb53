Matchroom boss Barry Hearn is ’95 per cent’ sure Anthony Joshua faces Tyson Fury at the start of next year. With the Covid-19 pandemic grounding global sport to a halt, the snooker and darts kingpin believes fans will not tolerate tune-up fights once the lockdown is lifted. And, while son and boxing promoter Eddie is plotting a summer return for the sport behind closed doors, founding father Barry is predicting the biggest show of all at the start of 2021. The 71-year-old, who recently recovered from a heart attack, told Betfred: “Anthony Joshua is probably the easiest boxer I have ever worked with, he literally will fight anybody and he is very keen on unifying the titles and Tyson has the missing belt. “Tyson is not afraid of anyone, at the same time, and he knows if he beats Joshua he will be an even bigger global figure.  “The good news about this pile-up of global sport events is that there will be competition for airtime when sport returns and people will not pay for tick-over contests. “I think we have an excellent chance of seeing that fight, I would say 50-50 it is this year and, if it is not this year, then it’s 95-5 for early 2021.” A string of complications are in the way of an all-British undisputed decider. Watford’s WBA, IBF and WBO champ has been ordered to fight Bulgarian veteran Kubrat Pulev next and Ukrainian genius Oleksandr Usyk swiftly after. And Fury, the freshly crowned WBC king, is contractually tied into a third fight with Deontay Wilder, who is licking his wounds after being battered by the Gypsy King and complaining of a bicep injury.
