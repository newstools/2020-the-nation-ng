 BUA Foundation, the philanthropic arm of BUA Group,  has released N300million to the Presidential Taskforce on Covid-19 to aid its logistics in line with the earlier pledge of Founder/Chairman, Abdul Samad Rabiu. The BUA Foundation also  released N600million to the following states: N100million each to Kwara, Kaduna, Ekiti, Rivers, and  N200million to Lagos State – distinct from the N1billion health infrastructure intervention grant being provided to equip a health facility in Lagos. These new contributions are also in addition to BUA’s earlier disbursement of N1billion to the CACOVID Private Sector Coalition, and N100million each to Sokoto, Ogun and Edo states as BUA continues to champion the fight against the virus.  Rabiu said it was important that private sector steps in to support the country in combating the virus. Rabiu added: “BUA Foundation is already working  with the Presidential Task Force, NCDC and other stakeholders on how best to deploy these funds to immediately equip the selected facilities in Kano, especially and Lagos within the next few weeks. “These grants will be disbursed and monitored in line with globally accepted best practice. “We need each other to come together in fighting this virus,” he added.
