In the face of raging coronavirus pandemic disrupting social order across the globe, the National Agency for the Control of AIDS (NACA) has advised all persons living with HIV to stay safe and be vigilant. In his message to PLWAs, the Director-General of NACA, Dr. Gambo Gumel Aliyu, said the virus is a serious global respiratory pandemic, which has no cure for now. While adding that the virus is dangerous for anyone, Aliyu said people with pre-existing medical challenges are the ones that suffer severely from the disease because of poor immunity. He, therefore, admonished people living with HIV to refrain from joining mass gatherings by staying at home, practising personal hygiene and be vigilant in order not contract coronavirus. “People with weak body defense systems suffer serious consequences. People living with HIV must continue to take all the necessary precautions given by World Health Organisation and Nigeria Center for Disease Control with special emphasis on adherence to antiretroviral medications, minimising exposure to COVID-19 by staying at home, hand washing and practising personal hygiene, and social distancing. Stay safe and healthy. If you experience fever, cough, difficulty in breathing or any suspicious symptom, please call COVID hotline: 08033264035 or seek medical care immediately,” he said.
