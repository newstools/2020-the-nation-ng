But for the outbreak of Coronavirus and subsequent blanket blackout of football, the Super Eagles and Indomitable Lions of Cameroon would have re-enacted  their rivalries  yet again in an international  friendly  match  on the margins  of  the  now postponed  qualifiers  for the 2021 African Cup of  Nations(AFCON). Nigeria  and Cameroon has clashed 23 times  with  the last being the Super Eagles 3-2 defeat  of the Indomitable Lions  last June in the quarter final  match of  the 2019 AFCON in Egypt  and  NationSport  gathered  that  plans were already afoot  for another  rally until COVID-19 took centre stage. “ We were about to start looking for some options (friendly matches for the Super  Eagles)  but there was nothing really done before the outbreak of COVID-19,”explained  Jairo Pachon,  the FIFA licensed Match Agent under the auspices of Eurodata Marketing Sportivo E Culturale (simply known as Eurodata Sport). Eurodata Sport has for many years been in charge of organizing international friendly matches amongst other logistical support for the Nigeria Football Federation(NFF) and Pachon hinted  the Super Eagles would have played  a couple of friendly matches until COVID-19 put spanners into the works. “ In fact, we  were looking at just African  teams as we cannot play outside Africa beyond five hours in between matches according to FIFA  because we were looking at a game before or after  the AFCON qualifying match,” Pachon further explained.“ In fact,  I  already had  mandate  with Cameroon and we were waiting to see if CAF changed  the date either to June or Sept; the  idea was to play a quality friendly match whether in June or September but we have to wait  now  to sort things  out when  everything becomes normal.”
