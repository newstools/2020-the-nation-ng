Osun State has warned private hospitals to stop admitting and treating suspected or confirmed coronavirus patients. Information and Civic Orientation Commissioner Mrs Funke Egbemode handed down the warning on Thursday, saying anyone caught flouting the order would be prosecuted. Egbemode said the government had accredited health facilities with required personnel to treat suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients. “The state government of Osun has reiterated that private hospitals… are not allowed to treat COVID-19 patients, whether suspected or confirmed. “The state has recognised, accredited… government facilities with the required personnel to take care of patients, whether suspected or confirmed, at its isolation and care centres. Testing and treatment are free in all government facilities,” she said. The commissioner noted that attempt to treat COVID-19 patients in private facilities would only open the state to community infections and negate the sacrifices the people had made so far.
