The Lagos State Government has directed Muslims across to observe their Taraweeh (a special night prayer during Ramadan) at home. Commissioner for Home Affairs Prince Anofiu Elegushi also enjoined Muslims to observe their five daily prayers at home. This, he said, was in line with the social distancing. Earlier on, the State Government had banned all forms of social, political or religious gatherings due to the spread of the Coronavirus while giving a stay-at-home order to non-essential workers during the lockdown. The commissioner called on every Imam to direct all worshippers to pray at home when they make their call to prayers. Prince Elegushi urged the faithful to seize the opportunity of the Ramadan to pray for Godâ€™s mercies. He stated that with the various measures put in place by governments all over the world and particularly the Lagos state government, there will be light at the end of the dark tunnel.
