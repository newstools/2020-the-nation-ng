Super Eagles defender Chidozie Awaziem has enthused about the possibility of donning the colours of Spanish La Liga giants Real Madrid. The defender is currently on loan at La Liga side Leganes from Portuguese football heavyweights FC Porto. Awaziem, who was been a regular for Leganes this season, was speaking on the league’s official Twitter page, La LigaEN. The 23-year-old player also revealed that he is a big fan of Real captain and defender Sergio Ramos. “I have been dreaming about it [La Liga]. It’s my dream to play in La Liga and also play for Real Madrid, and I am fighting towards it and I hope and pray I achieve it one day,” Awaziem said. I like Sergio Ramos, I like him a lot. I like his style of play his attitude to the game, his fighting spirit and his leadership.” Awaziem is open to staying in La Liga when his loan deal expires at the end of the current campaign. “Officially I am a Porto player but it depends on what the future holds. If Porto have a future for me to stay in the club for I sure I’m going to stay there because I love the club also,” he added. But if they don’t have an option or make a position for me to play there, then it’s better I continue in La Liga with Leganes.” The former FC Nantes player has made 18 appearances in La Liga for Leganes thus far.
