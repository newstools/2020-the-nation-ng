Rotary Club of Victoria Island  East, District 9110 and the Yomi-Sholoye Foundation on Thursday distributed over 5,000 relief packages and cooked food to vulnerable persons in Aro Community in Eti-Osa Local Government Area, Lagos. The items included rice, beans, garri, bread, semovita and cash. The gesture, the donors said, would help cushion the effect of the Federal Government’s two-week extension of the total lockdown in Lagos, Ogun and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The Club’s President, Otunba Gbemi Oyeneyin urged the beneficiaries not to resell the items, but to give freely if they had more than enough. Yomi-Sholoye Foundation founder, Dr Oluwaseye Yomi-Sholoye said if people had enough food and money to meet their basic needs, they would find it easier to comply with the lockdown. She appealed to the community to continue to obey directives to combat the spread of Coronavirus such as regular hand washing, personal hygiene, social distancing and other directives by the Lagos State Government and the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).
