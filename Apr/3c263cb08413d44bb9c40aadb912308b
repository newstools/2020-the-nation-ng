Security strategies deployed so far to curb banditry in Niger State have failed, a senator representing Niger East Senatorial District, Alhaji Sani Musa has said. Bandits attacks in three councils of the state have continued apace despite military response including airstrikes. Shiroro, Munya, and Rafi local government areas are the epicentre of the attacks. Over 15 people have been killed, eight abducted while over 2,000 forced out of their homes in several communities in those councils. Sani-Musa wondered how the bandits could have breached the security arrangements government claimed to have deployed in the areas. He appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to establish a military base in the affected communities. “All the makeshift security arrangements have failed and the bandits have taken over some communities in these three local government areas. That is why I am appealing to the President to fulfill his promise of establishing a military base in the area. “The President promised to put a military base in that location where these bandits are having a field day to curb these incessant attacks and the killings but nothing has been done. The situation is getting out of hand. “It seems that Mr. President has abandoned my people to their faith because ever since the recent attacks and my people are being killed, nobody has commiserated with us.”
