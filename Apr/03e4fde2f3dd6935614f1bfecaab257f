The Coalition for A Better Nigeria on Thursday urged Nigeria to deploy a software to assist in the fight against COVID-19. It described the application, designed by an Israeli firm, WideBridge, as unique, adding that the three tiers of government would find it useful. The coalition’s National Coordinator, Awa Bamiji, said a video illustration of the application was available for “workability check” by the government. “This application will be very useful for each staff coordinator to get feedback from field workers. It is an Android phone or walkie-talkie application,” Bamiji said in a statement.
