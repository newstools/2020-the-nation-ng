The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) Borno State office, says it has shutdown an illegal facility engaged in the production of unregistered yoghurt. The information was disclosed in a statement signed by the state Acting Coordinator, Mr Nasiru Mayo, and made available to News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday in Abuja. According to Mayo, the shutting down of the manufacturing facility is done during the surveillance activities in the state in line with the statutory mandate of the agency. He added that the product compromised all standards, in view of gross lapses with respect to Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) as well as not registered with NAFDAC. Mato while criticising the practice, said the first line of sanction applied was to put the facility on hold, seizure and destruction of the product and summoning the owner for possible prosecution. According to him, available information confirms that the owner took the advantage of COVID-19 pandemic situation to produce and sell the unregistered product in the state. He, however, said that NAFDAC would not close its eyes and allow such regrettable violations to sabotage the effort of safeguarding the health of the public. He warned that stiffer punishments awaited those who persisted on production of unregistered products. He added that the agency would remain vigilant more than ever before and called on the public to learn their lessons from this situation. (NAN)
