Following the rise in the number of persons infected by the dreaded COVID-19, the Ondo State Government on Wednesday closed its borders with neighboring Ekiti, Edo, Osun, Kogi and Ogun States. It said the border closure would take effect from 6pm on Thursday, April 2nd. The State Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Donald Ojogo, in a press statement issued on Wednesday evening said the decision was taken after observing the trend and the pos­sibility of its unde­terminable spread to the state. Ojogo said the order prohibited inter-state travels into the state and that Secu­
rity operatives as well as monitoring te­ams have been put on the alert to enforce the order as part of measures already taken to stem COVID­-19 incursion into the state. According to the statement, :To His Glory, Ondo State has remained one of the states in the country without a single confirmed case of COVID-19. This is an uncommon Grace. Government and indeed, the people must not take for grante­d. “As a way of thanking God and seeking His face for this immeasurable grace and continuous Favour, government hereby declares a 3-day period of fasting and prayers commencing from Thursday, 2nd to Saturday, 4th April for Ondo State and the country at large. “Government therefore, urges the good peo­ple of Ondo State to use this period to stand firm in prayers and remain inexora­ble in His praise as mankind faces this pandemic. “May God sustain His Grace upon Ondo State.”
