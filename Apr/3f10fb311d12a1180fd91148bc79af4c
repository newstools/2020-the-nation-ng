It is no longer news that a member of the House of Representatives, Usman Bello Kumo, was expelled from the All Progressives Congress (APC) by Kumo East Ward for alleged anti-party activities and undermining of  his godfather, Sen. Danjuma Goje. But the immediate cause of the Rep’s woes was his alleged car gift to one Garba Inuwa Gona, for insulting Goje on a local radio. According to the letter of expulsion signed by the Chairman of APC in Kumo East ward, Musa Barade, the ward executive members were shocked that the Representative gave out a car to a man for insulting a former governor of the state. The letter said in part: “The act of insulting and humiliating the personality of Senator Danjuma Goje during empowerment programme at Kumo and factionalisation and destruction of the party’s campaign office at Kumo are against our party’s ethics. “Also, the car donation by Usman Kumo to an interloper, one Garba Inuwa Gona, who is not even a constituent of Akko Federal Constituency, simply because he insulted Senator Goje on a local radio, clearly demonstrated his indiscipline, immorality and total disrespect to the leadership of the party.” Nigerians await the response of Kumo to know whether or not he has added a new dimension to Nigerian politics: You insult, you get a car.”
