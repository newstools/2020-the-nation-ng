The Chief Fire Officer of the state, Mr Moshood Adewuyi, said this in Ibadan while addressing newsmen. He appealed to residents of the state to be cautious in the handling of cooking and electrical appliances to minimise incessant fire disasters. ” In many instances, carelessness of our people gave room for avoidable fire disasters. ” Majority of these disasters are caused when people leave electrical appliances unattended to. ” Many people leave cooking gas unattended to, resulting in many of the disasters that we have experienced over time,” Adewuyi said.
