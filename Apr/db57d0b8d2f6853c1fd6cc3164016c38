The West African Examinations Council (WAEC) has launched an interactive platform for WASSCE candidates to interface with the Council. A statement by the Head of Public Affairs, WAEC, Nigeria, Demianus Ojijeogu, noted that log in details to the portal, WAECKonnect.com, have been sent to the emails they used in registering for the examination. The statement reads: “This is an interactive information sharing platform that allows the Council to effectively engage candidates before, during and after examinations. “Candidates are advised to log on to the portal: www.waeckonnect.com with the login details sent to their email addresses during the registration process, and avail themselves of this veritable tool for their examination success.” The statement also advised candidates to use the Chief Examiners reports, which is available on the WAEC website to learn what pitfalls to avoid while writing the examination. “This will give you reasons why candidates who sat previous WAEC examinations performed below expectations. It will help you to avoid the errors that made candidates record below-average performance. Log on to: www.waeconline.org.ng/e-learning and check the Chief Examiners’ Reports from 2008 to 2018. “This portal gives a comprehensive analysis of candidates’ performance in all subjects, identifying their strengths and weaknesses, what they failed to do and what they should have done to perform better. The link again is: www.waeconline.org.ng/e-learning.” The West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) for school candidates was scheduled to start April 6, 2020 but was postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
