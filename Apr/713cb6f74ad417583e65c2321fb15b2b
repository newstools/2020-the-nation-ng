 BRITISH citizens and residents may have to live with some restrictions until coronavirus vaccine is developed, officials have said. A virus vaccine may not be available until about 18 months. The London Mail reported that while some ministers want to lift the most restrictive parts of the lockdown, including school and shop closures, within weeks, some others insist that the only true ‘exit strategy’ is a vaccine or a cure. An official said that social distancing measures that have been placed upon Britons could be indefinite. Official plans to encourage social distancing on a long term, voluntary basis, have also been discussed, as the government continues to hold talks on how long Britons can cope with the current measures. Some measures, such as remote working, could be left in place for longer. Dominic Raab, standing in for the Prime Minister while he is sick, has said it is ‘too early’ to lift the full lockdown, which will be formally extended next Thursday for several weeks.
