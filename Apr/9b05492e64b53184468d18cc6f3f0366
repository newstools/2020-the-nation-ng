 NASARAWA State Deputy Governor Emmanuel Akaabe has threatened to shut down any motor park that engages in clandestine operations of conveying goods from Kano and other high risk states into the state. Dr Akaabe, who is the state chairman of COVID-19 Task Force Team, spoke yesterday in his office in Lafia, the state capital, during an emergency security meeting with leaders of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), the National Association of Road Transport Owners (NARTO) and security chiefs. He expressed disappointment that despite the ban on inter-state movement, the transport union members still engaged in overnight to and from Kano and other high risk states. The deputy governor directed that the transporters should henceforth stop conveying goods from any part of the state into Nasarawa except food items and drugs. He said the use face masks had become compulsory in all parts of the state. “The index case we recorded in the state was imported from Kano. We need to be very careful, especially given our proximity to the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and Kaduna. The ban on inter-state movement is not meant to punish anybody. You must be alive to do business,” Akaabe said.
