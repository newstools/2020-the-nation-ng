Conflicting test results of two patients suspected to be infected with the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) have led to confusion at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH) in Benin City, Edo State. The Chief Medical Director (CMD) of the Federal Government-owned hospital, Prof. Darlington Obaseki, on Saturday in Benin, however, called for calm, while insisting that the situation was under control. The ugly development led to panic in Benin and its environs, in view of Friday’s disclosure by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) that two persons in Edo and Lagos states lost their lives to COVID-19, without giving further details. It was gathered yesterday in Benin that the two patients at UBTH, who earlier tested negative to the coronavirus pandemic, were later declared positive, following further tests. In view of the initial negative result of the tests, the umbrella body of doctors, National Association of Residents Doctors (NARD), UBTH chapter, in its updates to members of the association, said: “Both patients were moved to the isolation ward on March 31, based on suspicion of COVID-19. Samples were sent for PCR at the Federal Government-owned Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital in Edo State the same day, as they were both being managed for medical illnesses: Chronic Kidney Disease and Bronchopnuemonia. “The patient with Chronic Kidney Disease unfortunately died, while the other patient is still receiving care. Both results have returned negative for COVID-19. The ‘exco’ wishes to reassure members that there is no confirmed case of COVID-19 being managed anywhere in UBTH.” Members of the executive of NARD in UBTH, in another update, expressed surprise that the earlier results of the two suspected COVID-19 cases, previously declared negative, turned out to be positive, after further tests. The CMD of UBTH, in an internal memo, confirmed the receipt of the conflicting results on the COVID-19 status of two patients in the hospital.
