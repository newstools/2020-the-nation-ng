John Ofikhenua, Abuja Senior Pastor and General Overseer Of The Zionwealth Church Lekki, Lagos, Apostle Chris Omashola, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to assuage the pains that the COVID -19 lockdown has caused Nigerians. The cleric slammed him for the sparse measures the Federal Government has so far put in place to cushion the effects of the “sit at home” enforcement. In a statement on Tuesday, Omashola insisted that since the lockdown has impunged on the right of the poor Nigerian to fend for themselves, it has automatically become the responsibility of the government to help them out. The cleric said: “President Buhari should do something quickly. Nigerians are crying, frustrated and hungry.” Continuing, he said : “In an unjust and unfair society like ours, where the rights of the poor masses are constantly abused, undermined and taken for granted where the average citizens are deprived of their rights, wellness and citizenry privileges…SILENCE IS A SIN! We’re all equal in the eyes of the Almighty Creator. Nigerians are been taken for granted, Let’s not keep quiet.” Omashola said the government has, so far, proven to be highly insensitive to the plights of the average Nigerian. According to him, Nigerians are begging for what, ideally, should be their basic rights. He expressed concern that billions have been donated to Nigeria by local and international philanthropists and bodies towards easing the strain caused by the lockdown and the pandemic yet no tangible measures have been set in place by the government to lessen the people’s pains. He noted that pastors and business men have affected more lives during these trying times, than politicians.
