 The Chairman and Chief Executive Offucer ( CEO) of Air Peace, Mr. Allen Onyema has declared he is not interested in politics, insisting he is a businessman without any political ambition. He stated his humanitarian gestures stems from his desire to give back to the society as his own contribution to humanity and not a fillip to aspire to any political office. Onyema made this known on Sunday while reacting to an online poster by a group known as United People of Nigeria Initiative (UPNI) endorsing him for Nigeria’s presidency in 2023. The Air Peace Chairman, who said that the call was made in bad taste, repudiated the endorsement. He disowned those behind the campaign and urged them to desist from it. In a statement, Onyema said, “My attention has been drawn to an online poster by a group that goes by the name United People of Nigeria Initiative (UPNI) endorsing me for Nigeria’s presidency in 2023. One Sir Wealthson Chukwudi was exposed on the poster as President of the group.  “I wish to state clearly that this man, UPNI and its promoters are not known to me directly or remotely and whatever they are saying has not come from me and will never come from me. I am a businessman and not a politician. “My purpose is to impact humanity and I do not have to be President first before I can continue with what has become part of my essence. This is my nature. My motivations are different. “I call on the public to completely ignore this group and any other group or person/s that may come up with such message and mischief about me in future. I, personally, feel very offended by it all. “I am very suspicious of the motive behind this unsolicited publication. Once again, I am not interested in partisan politics.”
