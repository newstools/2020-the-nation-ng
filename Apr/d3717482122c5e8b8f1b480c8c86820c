 A NON-GOVERNMENTAL organisation (NGO), Real Acts of Kindness (RAK) Foundation, yesterday donated 3,000 sanitisers and 3,000 food items to Badagry residents in Lagos State, to reduce the hardship caused by the lockdown directive. Speaking with reporters during the distribution of the items tagged ‘COVID-19 Relief Support (Ounje Anu)’, the founder of the NGO, Mr. Mobolaji Ogunlende, said the gesture was to alleviate hunger. Ogunlende said the foundation had procured 3,000 bottles of sanitisers and 3,000 bottles of liquid soap to distribute to residents. Ogunlende said the items would be handed over to the 20 councillors in the three local government areas in Badagry, namely Badagry Local Government, Badagry West Local Council Development Area (LCDA) and Olorunda LCDA, who would distribute them among the people. The Majority Leader in Badagry West LCDA, Mr. Rasak Amusa, while receiving the items, promised to distribute them among the residents.
