SINGER Wande Coal has promised to remake ‘D&G,’ one of the songs off Davido’s last album, A Good Time. The sonorous singer, who is widely referred to as the Black Diamond, made the revelation after Davido announced the date to the release of the song’s music video. Wande hinted, “This is my jam. I am doing my version very soon.” D&G occupies track six of Davido’s sophomore album released in 2019. The song, which features top American singer and songwriter, Summer Walker, has gotten reactions from several Nigerian celebrities. Wande Coal was recently spotted recording some songs with Peruzzi, a DMW signee, who recently released a three-track Elongated Play.
