  No fewer than six persons have lost their lives to banditry and renewed war between rival cult groups in different parts of Edo State. Our reporter learnt on Wednesday that two farmers were shot dead in Odighi, Ovia Northeast Local Government Area by armed men, suspected to be herdsmen, who aimed at the innocent men, who were going to their farms to harvest crops. An indigene of Odigutue, a neighbouring community to Odighi, Hilary Omoregie, disclosed yesterday in Benin that the slain farmers were Igbira and Urhobo men, who were so unfortunate to be shot at close range, thereby dying on the spot. In the renewed cult war in Edo between members of eiye and black axe confraternities, four persons were killed. A young man, whose name could not be ascertained as at press time, was on Tuesday night shot dead at Ugbague Lane, Benin by rival cult members, while a youth leader in Ward 12 of Oredo LGA narrowly escaped being killed when some cultists shot at him. Another man was trailed in Benin and shot dead, while he was about to bathe. It was also gathered that two persons were killed on Benin Technical College road and Universal Junction, along Medical Stores road in Egor LGA by cultists who drove a red Toyota Camry car. Edo Commissioner of Police, Lawal Jimeta, stated that some suspects were arrested by the anti-cultism unit of the command and that investigation was ongoing on the killing of the farmers. Jimeta urged Edo residents to be calm, while assuring that officers and men of the command would continue to protect lives and property.
