By Kofoworola Belo-Osagie  Some COVID-19 patients in the Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) Yaba have produced a video to improve awareness about the virus and thank health workers for nursing them back to health. The video which was shared on Twitter by Moji Delano, @mojidekanoblog Wednesday afternoon featured some 12 patients in a file bearing written messages which they flashed before the camera as the danced away. The patients, among whom were three foreigners, wore face masks and covers that largely obscured their identities in one of the wards of the hospital. Some of the messages they bore reads: “Health workers also have families but they can’t stay at home; please stay safe; stay alive. #Lagoscividgang2020.”; “It is real; we are living through this but we are confident we will overcome together; kudos to Lagos and its amazing team”; “Hey people, we are foreigners here and we are begging you to stay home for your relatives’ sake;” “many thanks to the health workers; they have been a blessing.” At his Tuesday briefing, Lagos State Health Commissioner, Prof. Akin Abayomi had said many of the cases in the state were mild and moderate with none of the cases on ventilator. “Most of the patients are experiencing a mild to moderate degree of the illness, no patient requires ventilation at the moment. “I will estimate that about 33 of the 66 are mild, about 33 are showing moderate diseases characterised by severe fever, some coughing, and general body pain,” he said. Covid-19 patients at IDH Yaba Lagos have a message for us about staying safe. Pls let’s keep them in our prayers even as we share their message. Also shoutout to @followlasg and @jidesanwoolu for efforts made to flatten the curve. #LagosCovidGang2020 #Day6OfLockdown pic.twitter.com/nC7UYxHMyJ — Moji Sensei Delano (@MojiDelanoBlog) April 1, 2020
