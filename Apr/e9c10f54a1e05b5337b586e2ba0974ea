So when we finished the studying and testing we are doing, I think the drug will come up in line very very soon. ” Most importantly, he added “if the pandemic escalates, the NAFDAC will know what to do, like they did in USA to fast track the use of chloroquine. “If we have a need NAFDAC will know what to do.
