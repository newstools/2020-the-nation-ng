 FORMER Villarreal and Getafe forward Ikechukwu Uche has advised his Nigerian compatriot Samuel Chukwueze to remain at Estadio de la Ceramica and continue his development. Chukwueze has been a regular fixture for the Yellow Submarine since he made his La Liga debut in 2018, and he has featured in 26 league matches this term, scoring three goals and laying an assist. The Nigeria international emerged as a target for Liverpool in the January transfer window with the Reds’ 35 million Euros offer reportedly turned down by Villarreal. Uche, who spent most of his career in Spain, played for the Yellow Submarine between 2011 and 2015, and he is convinced that Chukwueze has what it takes to thrive in ‘one of the best teams in La Liga’. “He is very good; everything is working very fast for him. He’s doing well, he’s growing,” Uche told Nigeria Info. “With the games he’s been playing it shows he can get better. Where he is, it is obvious that he would get better. “He would do well because it is one of the best teams at the moment in the Spanish League. “They’ve had important players and like bringing up players from the second team and make them stars.” Uche is currently a free agent after leaving Spanish second division side Gimnastic de Tarragona at the end
