 A DATE for Anthony Joshua’s clash with Kubrat Pulev is no closer to being finalised amid the coronavirus crisis’ stranglehold on sport. The heavyweight world title fight was due to take place at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on June 20. It was then pencilled in, but never confirmed, for July 25 when the pandemic ground sport across the world to a halt. But with all sports set to return behind closed doors, Joshua faces an indefinite wait to defend the belts he won back from Andy Ruiz Jr last December. The fight is unlikely to be held behind closed doors but could be moved to a smaller venue, depending on government advice. Matchroom Boxing CEO Frank Smith told Mirror Fighting : “A lot of the big fights, Joshua vs Pulev, Dereck Chisora v Oleksandr Usyk and Dillian Whyte vs Alexander Povetkin, are very difficult to run financially without the gate. “I’m hopeful he will fight this year, we’re looking at a number of different options. We’re talking to Tottenham still but that’s very tough with the football schedule and not knowing what will happen with crowds. “We could look at smaller venues for him as time goes on; it’s difficult to make a decision now without knowledge of how things will look.” Boxing is currently suspended in the UK until June with Matchroom’s next show currently scheduled for June 27 in Newcastle. But a July restart is more likely with TV studios and purpose-built venues set to host fights without crowds.
