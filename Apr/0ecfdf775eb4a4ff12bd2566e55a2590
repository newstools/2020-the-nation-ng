In recent days the Brazilian playmaker has been linked with a move back to England with Chelsea and Man United mentioned among many possible destinations for the Barcelona player. Speaking to our partners Sky Sports in the UK, Joorabchian joked that just because he’s an Arsenal fan that doesn’t mean he’s pushing all of his clients to sign for the Gunners and then discussed Coutinho’s future. “The fact I’m an Arsenal supporter is not a secret,” Joorabchian said. “I don’t have any preference where the players go. I don’t try to push someone to one club or another.  Everything is a possibility. After the Champions League game he [Coutinho] played in England we had a long chat about it. The Premier League is something that he has always enjoyed playing in, and loved playing in, and would probably love to come back and play in. The question is what are going to be the financial conditions of all the clubs, including Barcelona and all the Premier League clubs at the end of this pandemic.” That last point is obviously key to not only Coutinho’s future but of every single player and club in the game right now.
