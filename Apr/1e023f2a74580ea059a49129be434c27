 The Union of Campus Journalists Alumni Association of the University of Ibadan has urged Nigerians to show compassion during this period of Coronavirus pandemic. Its National President, Dr. Adebayo Ajala, said in a statement,  that they should be courteous, show utmost compassion to fellow human beings. He said the union decried inflation of prices of food items without consideration at such a sensitive time and the overbearing attitude of security agents. “It is also inhuman for security agents to impound vehicles bringing food and agricultural materials to the people for contravening the ‘sit at home’ order; we also implore the security agents to perform their functions with the milk of humanity. Caning, slapping, whipping of Nigerians for contravening the stay at home order should be reviewed.  Though we do not encourage indiscipline, we urge them to conduct these affairs with the milk of kindness expected during this trying period” Ajala said. The National SSecretary, Mr. Folarami Salau, urged Nigerians to rally round one another morally and financially in friendship as families, communities, associations and governments at all levels come together to defeat the COVID-19 pandemic. “Together in unity, love and humanity we can win,” he said.
