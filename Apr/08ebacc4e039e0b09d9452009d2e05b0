ANAP Foundation has impressed on the federal government the need to enforce social distancing in order to stem the spread of the dreaded coronavirus pandemic. The Foundation made this appeal yesterday in a statement signed by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, Atedo N. A. Peterside and Abubakar Siddique Mohammed respectively. Justifying the need for social distancing, the Foundation while making reference to the burial ceremony of the late Mallam Abba Kyari, the Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, which had unrestricted movements of persons including government officials, family members, friends and associates in defiance of guidelines on social distancing by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), said such rash behavior has implication for the safety and protection of citizens. The Foundation which expressed condolence to the Presidency and the immediate family of the late Mallam Kyari, however observed that, “the strict rules of social distancing were flouted at his burial today. This has serious implications for the good work that is being done by various agencies to keep our people safe. We call on the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 to note this and apply the laws across the board through leadership by example.” It therefore urged the authorities to lead by example and help ensure that all and sundry obey the well thought out rules for burials and all other gatherings at this time.
