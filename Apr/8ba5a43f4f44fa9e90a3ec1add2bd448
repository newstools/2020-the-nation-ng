By Nduka Chiejina (Assistant Editor)  The Office of the Accountant General of the Federation (OAGF) says it has successfully restored service on the Government Integrated Financial Management Information System platform (GIFMIS). GIFMIS is an information technology based system for budget management and accounting meant to improve public expenditure management processes. It also helps to enhance greater accountability and transparency across ministries and agencies of government. The OAGF, in a statement, said the shut down of the GIFMIS platform was caused by the fire that broke out on the fourth floor of the Treasury House on Wednesday. The fire had affected the outdoor panels of the cooling system of the Server, and as a result, the Server automatically shut itself down. The statement said: “repair work was immediately carried out on the affected equipment and by 12:30pm on Thursday, the Server was successfully restarted.” According to the Accountant General of the Federation (AGF) Mr. Idris Ahmed “service has been restored and payments can be made and received through the GIFMIS Platform.”
