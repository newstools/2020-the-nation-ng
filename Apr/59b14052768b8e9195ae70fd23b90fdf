The Abia State College of Education (Technical), Arochukwu has concluded arrangements to commence on-line teaching in line with the directive of Governor Okezie Ikpeazu. Consequently, the Provost  of the College, Dr Philips Nto has directed all deans and heads of departments to collate all necessary logistics required for the immediate take off of the programme. In a circular he sent out to members of the Academic Board, Dr  Nto described the directive of the governor as a welcome development aimed at keeping the students academically busy for the period that COVID-19 will last. The Provost directed all academic staff of the college to liaise with their heads of department for briefing so as to make the exercise successful. He noted that since ASCETA is the epi-centre of the state government’s Education for Employment policy, there was the need for it to lead in not only Science and Technology but e-learning. Meanwhile, the Provost has commended the Governor for the proactive steps he has taken so far to check the spread of COVID-19 in the State. Dr Nto said it was instructive that even when the pandemic is yet to Creep to the state, the governor has set up isolation centres and medical staff to tackle it. According to him, Ikpeazu’s immediate lock-down of the state, closure of the borders as well as offering palliatives to the vulnerable have yielded results with Abia still remaining virus free. Dr Nto called on the people of the State to continue to support Governor Ikpeazu in his determined fight to safeguard the people from the dreaded COVID-19. He pledged the loyalty of the staff and students of ASCETA to the government in its bid to reposition the College as one of the most vibrant college of Education in the South-East.
