 The number of confirmed positive tests to the novel coronavirus in the Netherlands increased by 887 in a day to a total of 35,729, the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) announced on Thursday. Within 24 hours, the number of deaths from COVID-19 rose by 123 to 4,177 and the number of people, who are or were admitted to hospital, grew by 137 to 10,158. “The figures for the last few days are still in line with the impression that the measures against the spread of COVID-19 are working,’’ the RIVM stated. According to the RIVM, more people have been tested for COVID-19 since April 6, especially healthcare workers and vulnerable groups. “In recent weeks, the number of people being tested has risen to almost 40,000 per week,’’ the RIVM stated. “The percentage of people who test positive for COVID-19 had increased until the end of March, rising to about 30 per cent of the total number of people tested, and then decreased again.’’ (Xinhua/NAN)
