Lagos State government has reststed its commitment to curbing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic across the state. Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr Tunji Bello, stated this yesterday when he received chemical materials donated by some organisations to disinfect more parts of the state against community transmission of the pandemic. Bello spoke through the Permanent Secretary in the Office of Environmental Services, Mrs Aderonke Odeneye, who also kick-started the fumigation and disinfecting of the State Secretariat at Alausa in Ikeja with the deployment of trucks and sprinklers round the state. The chemical items, which were applied to major bus stops and overhead bridges, were donated by Reckitt and Benkiser, producers of JIK bleach. Other donors are Medlog Logistics Limited and GMT Limited.
