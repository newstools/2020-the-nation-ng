No private facility has been accredited for treatment of coronavirus, the Federal Government stated on Friday. The Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, made this known during the briefing of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19. He explained that no private hospital in the country has met the Ministry’s accreditation criteria yet.
According to him: “Lagos is looking at some hospitals for treating coronavirus. Private hospitals must show that they have the staff – doctors and nurses that must be infectious disease specialists and are trained in infection and control protocols,. The hospital must also have cleaners who are trained. “The hospital must also be properly delineated as it is in clean and dirty areas. There is no hospital that I know that has met the criteria in the country at the moment. “Treating of private patients is not allowed because the risk is very high. If the treatment of patients gets complicated before you rush them to the hospital, it will be too late for the person. So, the earlier they begin their treatment in an accredited and certified hospital the better it is.” Concerning the Chinese medical team in the country to support the coronavirus fight, the Minister said they were still observing the 14-day quarantine. He however, explained that officials and partners of the Ministry are in communications with them via teleconferencing.
