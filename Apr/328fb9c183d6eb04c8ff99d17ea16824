 NO fewer than 150 poor and vulnerable families benefited from food packages organised by the Tarmac Sango Community Development Association in Ado-Odo/Ota Local Government Area of Ogun State, to support governmentâ€™s efforts towards cushioning the effect of ravaging COVID-19 in the State. The CDA distributed bags of rice, beans, gaari and cartoons of tomato puree sachets to be shared among residents of the community. The CDA Chairman, Mr Samuel Olubodun, and some executives, loaded the packages in a Toyota pickup and dropped at the doorsteps of residents. Olubodun explained that, the move became imperative following the insignificant relief package donated by the state government to the CDA. He noted that, the government relief package was not enough for all households to stay indoor throughout the 14 days lockdown in accordance to government order as a preventive measure against the spread of the deadly virus. He said it necessitated the community to constitute a welfare committee and was able to raise money to purchase the foodstuff for the people.
