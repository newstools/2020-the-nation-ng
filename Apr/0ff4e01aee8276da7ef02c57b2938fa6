From Sunny Nwankwo, Umuahia  Former Governor of Abia State and the incumbent Senator representing Abia Central Senatorial District in the National Assembly; Chief Theodore Ahamefule Orji has disassociated himself from any 2023 Presidential move. This is even as Sen. Orji insisted that he would quit active partisan politics in 2023, at the end of his 8years in the senate. Orji also disassociated himself from his purported campaign posters that adorned some streets in Umuahia, the state capital and Aba respectively, claiming that he (Orji) would be running for the post of president come 2023. In a statement from his Liaison Office on Monday, Senator Theodore Orji accused people he described as “disgruntled” political enemies of being behind “the wicked act.” The statement stated partly, “Our attention has been drawn to some posters adorning some streets in Umuahia and Aba purporting that Senator TA Orji is running for President come 2023. “This is to let the public know that senator TA Orji is not running for any political position in 2023 as he has last year declared that he is quitting politics in 2023. “Those behind this act are those who are not happy with the towering status of the former Abia Governor in national politics. “Senator TA Orji is using this opportunity to assure his constituents that he will not be distracted by these latest antics of these political Lilliputians, as he will remain focused in delivering the dividends of democracy to the zone.”
