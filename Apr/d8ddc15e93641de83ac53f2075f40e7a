 TO cushion the impact of the lockdown order and the restriction of movement in some states following the spread of COVID-19, the Chairman of the Victims Support Fund (VSF), Gen. Theophilus Danjuma said he would provide N1billion worth of food and medicines to the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) across the country. To ensure effective reach and distribution, Danjuma inaugurated the VSF Task Force on COVID-19 and mandated them to provide palliative measures to IDPs and other vulnerable groups. Gen. Danjuma said the intervention was imperative given the global devastation of the Coronavirus pandemic and the huge human challenges it poses for the country. In a statement in Abuja on Wednesday, he said as a country, we must all do what we can to ensure that the spread is curtailed. On the duties of the committee set up, he said: “The Taskforce will provide N1billion worth of medical supplies, food, water, and non-food items for IDPs and others who will face special challenges at this difficult time. “The task force shall also work closely with all Federal and State government organs and agencies tasked with the responsibility for providing direction and leadership in the fight against COVID-19, including the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 and all relevant MDAs. “The Task Force will also extend support to other frontline organizations working to curtail the spread of the novel Corona Virus.” Members of the committee are; Mrs. Toyosi-Akerele Ogunsuji as the Chairperson, Dr. Bulama Mali Gubio, Amb John Gana, Mr. Sunday Oibe, Mr. Alkasim Abdulkadir, and Prof. Sunday Ochoche as members. He urged the committee to embark on massive sensitization campaigns amongst vulnerable groups to inform and educate them on the best hygiene and sanitation practices to prevent the further spread of the disease.
