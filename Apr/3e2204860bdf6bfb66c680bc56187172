Chief Medical Director of Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital (AKTH) Professor Abdurrahman Abba Sheshe has said the hospital’s NCDC/COVID-19 Test Centre is open only to those referred by the centre and not the public. The CMD spoke in reaction to the high turnout of people thronging the hospital seeking to be tested for coronavirus. Professor Sheshe said the procedure of processing samples for testing was through referral by NCDC. He noted that that it was not the responsibilities of either a doctor or laboratory scientist in the COVID-19 Test Centre to take the positive patient to any isolation centres. A local radio station at the weekend reported that those who tested positive at the NCDC laboratory were given results and directed to one of the isolation centres earmarked by the state at Kwana Dawaki, in Dawakin Kudu council for isolation and treatment. The CMD said this was not true, adding that since inception about two weeks ago, the centre had received 300 samples, with many  negative, and a few positive. ‘’At the moment, the centre received samples from Katsina and Jigawa states in addition to the one in Kano,” said the statement. ”The hospital has also deployed some of its medical experts to all isolation centres to assist in fighting the pandemic disease.” As part of its services, the hospital would provide health care especially at the Dialysis Unit, Family Medicine as well as in the Accident and Emergency department, he said.
