 COMMUTERS and other road users were on Wednesday stranded for over an hour on the Umuikaa, Isiala Ngwa South LGA axis of Enugu-Port Harcourt expressway as youths in the area took to the road to protest the killing of a commercial driver by an official of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Isiala Ngwa Division. While detail of the incident is still sketchy, our reporter, however, gathered that the commercial motorist carrying perishable and non-perishable food items reportedly had heated argument at the NSCDC personnel. Unconfirmed reports have it that the driver in the midst of the argument attempted driving off, before being shot by the NSCDC official. The incident was said to have angered youths in the area who attempted lynching the NSCDC official. The NSCDC official, who narrowly escaped death by the whiskers ran into a police station in the area for safety.
