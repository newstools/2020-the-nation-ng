In view of the total lockdown imposed by the State Government to check the spread of coronavirus pandemic, Churches in Kaduna State were on Sunday shut despite the celebration of Easter. Our correspondent, who went round the state capital, observed that, only the security guards of churches were outside the gates to prevent unauthorised entry. At St. Andrew Catholic Church, Kakuri where Bishop Mathew Hassan Kukah presided before moving to Sokoto, the security man told our correspondent he has been instructed not to open the church for any worshipper.  According to him: “Yes, it is Easter period but, but the church leadership has instructed me not to open the Church to anyone, except the senior Reverends who may come to do one thing or the other and the woman who comes around to sweep the Church premises. “This is the third week now the Church has not had service because of coronavirus. We don’t want to endanger the lives of worshippers.” He explained The Nation reports Kaduna State Government had partially closed markets and prohibited all forms of gatherings, including church and mosque congregations. The Government had threatened any group, church or mosque that violates the order prohibiting gathering of large crowd will have its property demolished, land title revoked and people involved prosecuted. Meanwhile, some Christians who spoke to our correspondent said, they have been told by their pastors to celebrate Easter at home and pray that, God ends the coronavirus pandemic.
