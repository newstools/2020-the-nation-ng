Chairman of the country’s pioneer automobile firm, Leyland Nigeria, Mr. Yemi Idowu, has said the lockdown caused by coronavirus pandemic should not be a total loss for the country. Idowu, who is a former commercial bank executive, noted that Nigeria and Africa, should identify an opportunity in the impasse to reposition it’s economy and day to day life. Idowu said: “We have to embrace modern technology to approach the condition we find ourselves. Many young entrepreneurs have been operating this style for years. It is a new reality and we must embrace it. “COVID-19 is not much in Africa, but if care is not taken it can get worse . I commend the government for adopting the lockdown, otherwise the situation in Nigeria would have been worse.” He stressed that people can still hold meeting through conference call on video or audio while innovative services can still be provided, amid social distancing. Idowu said: “Up country trade for food and  vegetables can go online with adequate logistics.” He also said that this is an opportunity to reevaluate the national health care system. He added: “Regardless of the COVID-19 situation , government can do more by funding healthcare and education by reallocating  the annual budget sectorally”
