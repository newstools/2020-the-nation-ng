The Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS) on Thursday dismissed as untrue insinuations that Maryam Sanda was among those granted presidential amnesty last week. The service maintained that there was no iota of truth regarding the rumours making the round that she has been set free. Sanda was sentenced to death on January 27 by the FCT High Court for killing her husband, Bilyaminu Bello. Bello was killed on November 19, 2017. Sanda was arraigned alongside three others including her mother and brother. But the others were discharged by the court because the prosecutor was unable to link them to the murder. The late Bello was the son of former PDP nationalist chairman, Dr Haliru Bello while Sanda is the daughter of former manager of a microfinance bank. Spokesman of the correctional service, Deputy Comtroller, Augustine Njoku, in a statement, maintained that Maryam Sanda was yet in custody. She was not among the 70 inmates at the Medium Security Custodial Centre, Kuje, who were granted presidential pardon because she was not qualified for it, Njoku insisted.
