Dr Benedicta Ehanire, Public Relations Officer of UNIBEN, announced the directive in a statement made available to journalists on Tuesday in Benin. “The measure is to check the possible spread of the dreaded disease, Coronavirus, also known as COVID-19. “Towards this end, medical personnel will have no other alternative but turn away anyone who flouts this directive. “Please protect yourself, others and the health workers who are in the frontline in the fight against the pandemic,” he stated.
