  THERE is a ray of hope that the headquarters of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) will be completed 24 years after the contract was awarded. Since the project was initiated in 1996, successive administrations in NDDC were contented with payment for rented accommodation than the completion of the project. Findings confirmed that it got to a ridiculous extent that NDDC was paying N300million as rent per annum for office accommodation. But since September 2019, the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Sen. Godswill Akpabio (a.k.a Mr. Project) directed that the project must be completed within six months. Miraculously, the project has reached 98% completion. Will Akpabio and NDDC team break the jinx with 2% to go?
