Nigeria midfielder Wilfred Ndidi believes he is yet to play to his full potential  despite being regarded  as one of the best  in his position in the English Premier League. In the two full Premier League seasons that Wilfred Ndidi has featured for Leicester City, he has finished as the top tackler on both occasions. During the 2016/17 campaign, having joined Leicester in January 2017 from Belgian side KRC Genk, Ndidi completed 68 tackles in just 17 appearances. But Ndidi has attributed  his recent sterling display to Leicester boss  Bredan Rodgers. “He (Rodgers) has given me a wider view of where this is supposed to go to make me even better,” Ndidi said of Rodgers in a recent interview in LCFCQ Issue 11.“The statistics are okay, but I can be better than that – that’s the way I can explain it.” The midfielder was once again a star man for the Foxes in England’s highest tier of professional football, as he finished the campaign with a Premier League-high of 143 tackles – one more than Gueye and 14 more than Aaron Wan-Bissaka. Fellow Fox Ricardo Pereira, meanwhile, completed 118 dispossessions, finishing fourth in the Premier League’s rankings for tackles made. Leicester’s No.25 had already played for two teams at the highest level, and had represented his country at the World Cup and Africa Cup of Nations against some of the most gifted players on the planet. His impressive form has continued this term, where he currently sits third in the tackling charts with 91 to his name, despite missing six of City’s 29 matches. He is only eight behind Manchester United’s Wan-Bissaka, while City team-mate Ricardo leads the way by 20 with 119 tackles. In addition, he has made 61 interceptions and 194 recoveries, and has won 181 duels and 59 aerial battles in 2019/20.
