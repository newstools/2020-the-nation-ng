The command also assured residents of tense areas including Igando, Idimu, Ikotun, Agege, Dopemu, Abattoir, Mangoro, Alakuku of adequate police presence in their neighbourhoods following the deployment of the special forces ordered by Inspector General of Police (IG) Mohammed Adamu. The Nation reports that residents of these areas have been apprehensive since last week following alleged robbery attacks from suspected members of One Million Gang cult group. The gang purportedly wrote a letter telling residents to prepare for their impending visit. However, Police Commissioner Hakeem Odumosu has consistently denied reports of robbery attacks in these neighbourhoods insisting that the panicked residents were raising false alarms. A statement by the command’s spokesman Bala Elkana on Thursday said the police received several calls and messages mostly from residents of Igando, Idimu and Ikotun on alleged plans by the hoodlums to attack their areas which promoted massive deployment of police patrol teams to beef up security in the mentioned places. “Police Special Forces are strategically positioned, patrolling the length and breadth of the state. It could be recalled that the Inspector General of Police IGP Mohammed Adamu has graciously deployed a seasoned crime fighter, DIG Peter Babatunde Ogunyanwo, to Lagos and Ogun in order to have an on the spot assessment of the situation as well as coordinate the ongoing onslaught launched against criminal elements.
