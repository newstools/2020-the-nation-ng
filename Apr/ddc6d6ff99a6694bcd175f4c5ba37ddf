 The Court of Appeal in Abuja has ordered accelerated hearing in an appeal filed by Action Peoples Party (APP) against the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). A three-man panel, led by the court’s Acting President, Justice Monica Dongban-Mensem, in a ruling on Tuesday, also granted the appellant’s request for the abridgment of time in hearing of the appeal and ordered the respondent, INEC, to file its response within five days. The appeal marked: CA/ABJ/CV/218/2020 is against a February 21, 2020 judgment by Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu of the Federal High Court, to the effect that INEC was right to have excluded candidates of the appellant (APP) from participating in the governorship elections in Kogi and Bayelsa states in 2019. Justice Ojukwu held that the APP replaced its withdrawn candidates outside the statutory period of 45 days to the date scheduled for the last governorship elections in both states.  APP’s lawyer, Obed Agu, had while moving the appellant’s motion on notice, noted that it was imperative that the court order accelerated hearing of the appeal. Agu noted that the appeal must be heard within 60 days, as required under Section 285 of the Constitution. He noted that 30 days were already gone, so if hearing is not accelerated, the court will not be out of time to hear the appeal. Earlier at the commencement of proceedings, the court’s Acting President urged parties to be mindful of the Coronavirus disease and observe all protocols governing conduct of persons in the face of the pandemic as they come to court. “In view of the perilous times, counsel should make a point of duty not to delay proceedings unnecessarily. No filing of frivolous applications,” Justice Dongban-Mensem said.
