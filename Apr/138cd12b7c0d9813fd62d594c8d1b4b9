 NIGERIA’S D’Tigress forward, Evelyn Akhator has insisted that the COVID-19 pandemic has affected her fortune as a professional while insisting that it has also humbled a lot of people across the globe. Akhator, a member of the Nigeria’s gold medal-winning team at the 2017 and 2019 FIBA Afrobasket Women’s Championship has been engaging in daily indoor exercise to keep fit told NationSport yesterday that pandemic has affected virtually every sector of people’s lives. “This pandemic affected everything not just basketball or sports in general; it showed us that we all need to be humbled regardless of our economic status,” she said. She however, hailed the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the Organising Committee of Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games for the decision to shift the games to 2021. “It is a good decision made by IOC and OC of Tokyo 2020 to move it to 2021 because it would have been a disaster if it was not postponed,” Akhator said. For her, the pandemic has indeed eaten deep into her pocket. Our league in France got cancelled  and there is a possibility of me losing money because I can’t play summer league. I just admit that it has really affected me,” the Flammes Carolo of France star added. Akhator is a key  member of the D’Tigress team that qualified for Tokyo 2020 at the FIBA Olympic Qualifying Tournament (OQT) in Belgrade, Serbia and having started her career in the WNBA in United States, the 25-year-old has played in the Russian, Turkish and Spanish elite leagues before pitching her tent with the French side Flammes Carolo on November 2019.
