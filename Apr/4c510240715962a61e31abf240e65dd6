President of Toronto Raptors Masai Ujiri  said  the continent must show some resilience in order to curtail the wide spread  of the coronavirus pandemic despite its continuous spread all over the world. Ujiri has therefore urged basketball players, fans, coaches, and everyone in the world to stay safe while the battle the unseen enemy continues. “I think Africa has been resilient and has handled this well. I think that a lot of leaders are ahead of it and I hope that the ones that are not are starting to pay attention because this is an unknown scourge; this is an unseen enemy and we have to really pay attention,” said Ujiri who played for Nigeria at the Afrobasket in 1997 in Senegal. “I am positive and I am proud that Africa handled the Ebola crisis very well. We have handled a lot of different viruses and diseases, whether it’s Ebola or malaria in the past and hopefully, we will get over this.” He, however, expressed  concern over the fate of underprivileged people in refugee camps and poor areas not just in Africa but all over the world,  urging the authorities to take special care of this set of people at this critical time. “This shall pass and we’ll get back to doing what we all do, but I think it’s really time to play by the rules, practice social distancing, washing our hands and being clean. “There is going to be a new normal after all of this and we look forward to it. We look forward to it, we look forward to getting back to real life, but for now we have to abide by the rules. “For us to stay safe, we need to listen to public health experts,” added Ujiri who led Raptors to their first NBA title last year.
