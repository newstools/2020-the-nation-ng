 THE Nigeria Academy of Medicine (NAM) has urged Nigerians to support both the federal and state governments in the fight against the spread of coronavirus disease in the country. Secretary of the group, Professor Oluwole Atoyebi noted that the rising number of infected persons in the country is worrisome. He commended the measures put in place so far by various state and federal authorities in containing the deadly viral disease. He said: ”In Nigeria, the number of cases rose from 3 to 12 within one week and 97 cases have been confirmed positive as at 10.40pm of March 28, 2020. Mathematical modelling suggests that the actual figure globally could be 10-20 times number of confirmed cases. ” At all levels, Nigerians must demonstrate a high level of leadership by playing their roles and ensure we prevent escalation of the outbreak. We commend Government at all levels, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control(NCDC) and the Presidential Task Force charged with containment of the coronavirus pandemic in the country on steps taken so far to stem the COVID-19 epidemic in our dear country. ” We however note, as others have done globally, that this is a war that must be fought by all and on all fronts if we are to come through with minimal damages and scars. COVID-19 has shown itself as not only a health emergency but also an economic emergency.
