 The Association of Resident Doctors (ARD) in Benue State University Teaching Hospital, Makurdi has praised  Governor Samuel Ortom for his intervention when they issued a 21-day strike ultimatum over 30 doctors given expiration / termination of residency training by the hospital management. Speaking to newsmen,  President of the association, Dr Amina Onyewuchi, said they embraced peaceful resolution following a meeting with the Governor. She added that from the Governor’s antecedents with the association, there was no reason to doubt his ability to amicably resolve the problem. “To be candid, since His Excellency, Dr Samuel Ortom came into office, there has been no challenge we have had that he has not solved; from the implementation of our teaching allowances in 2017 to payment of our skipping arrears in 2019. “It is because of his excellent antecedent that we tried to use every means to get his attention when thirty three of our members were issued letters of expiration / termination of their Residency Training.” The President also apologised to the Governor for taking the matter, which she described as ‘in-house’ to the media, stressing that it was not aimed at tarnishing the good image of the Governor or the state. “On behalf of the association, we wish to tender our unreserved apology to the Governor, His Excellency, Dr Samuel Ortom and also the hospital management and board for the embarrassment our media outing has caused. “As an association, we regretted any inconveniences this might have brought to the image of the Governor, the hospital and the state at large,”  she stated.
