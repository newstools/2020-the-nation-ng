A member representing Ughelli North Constituency ll at the Delta State House of Assembly, Hon. Prince Eric Oharisi, has debunked testing positive for COVID-19. Reports on social media platforms on Tuesday had claimed that the lawmaker was the state’s index case. But expressing shock at the development, the lawmaker described the reports as false, assuring that he and his family members are in good health. Calling on the general public to ignore the rumour, Prince Oharisi attributed the reports to the handiwork of his political detractors. Prince Oharisi said, “It’s fake. It is being peddled by enemy of progress but nemesis will soon catch up with them. I don’t know where this fake news is coming from. I don’t know.”
