 A DOCTOR in private practice reportedly died on Wednesday at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), Idi-Araba, Lagos mainland. The deceased, identified as 51-year-old Chugbo Emeka died of coronavirus-related complications which he developed from treating an infected patient in a hospital. He was allegedly rushed to referral hospital on Monday. The Chairman, Medical Advisory Committee of the hospital, Prof Wasiu Adeyemo, said the doctor was not a staff of the hospital, but was rushed to the facility after he showed symptoms of the disease. Adeyemo said: “The doctor is not a LUTH staff; he was a private practitioner, though he trained in LUTH some 18, 20 years ago. I remember I met him, I know him, he left LUTH around 2002. “One of his classmates called me that he has some issues in his private hospital, so I asked that he should be brought to LUTH. He was COVID-19 positive, we put  him on drugs but unfortunately, he died this morning (Wednesday).” The LUTH CMAC said he would not disclose the name of thedoctor and his hospital as it was against the ethics of the medical profession.
