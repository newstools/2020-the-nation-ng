The Delta State police command has said it arrested a woman from Cote d’Ivoire  and her driver over health concerns amid the global coronavirus pandemic The lady and her driver were handed over to health officials in Udu Local Government Area of the state, the police said. The Nation gathered that the lady and her driver have been isolated for 14 days and to be monitored by the health officials. Police spokesman DSP Onome Onovwakpoyeya said, “A lady who came in through the land borders from Cote d’Ivoire was apprehended and handed over to the health officials. “They asked for a certificate if she has been cleared from a test result and she had nothing to present, which made us to hand her over. This was at Udu area of the State. Also a driver she chartered was handed over to the officials for the tests.” Meanwhile, the police have  threatened to sanction any officer found extorting motorists and commuters to allow them into the state during the 14 days lockdown. She said allegations of extortion against officers and men who were deployed to ensure strict compliance with the lockdown directive were rife. She said: “We are having a lot of challenges having to contain motorists. One of which is that there are people exempted, and markets have been opened in strategic locations. Before you know it, you have a lot of people moving around with excuses. Even when they are held, they have one or two persons they will call for intervention. ”That is making the whole exercise difficult for officers and men. But even at that we are trying our best. But that doesn’t give them the right to collect money from motorists and commuters. Because anyone caught would be dealt with decisively. But we cannot be everywhere at the same time, even as we are monitoring. “We appeal to residents to call in whenever they encounter such illegal activities so we can take necessary action.”
