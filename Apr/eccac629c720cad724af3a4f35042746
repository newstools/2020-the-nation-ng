Anchor University Lagos (AUL) is celebrating the success of its first accreditation  since inception with 13 programmes presented to the National Universities Commission (NUC) getting the nod. Its Vice-Chancellor, Prof Joseph Afolayan, announced the results of the exercise during an emergency Senate meeting held on March 20, 2020. Thirteen of the 15 programmes the university started with in 2017 were presented for accreditation last October/November. Over 80 per cent of the programmes got full accreditation for five years. They were Accounting, Mass Communication, Business Administration, Political Science, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Computer Science, Mathematics, Microbiology, English and Literary Studies, and History and Diplomatic Studies. Only Physics and Economics had interim accreditation and would be revisited in two years. Afolyan thanked the Senate for their efforts during the exercise. “We thank God for this good news. We were well prepared for the exercise and we should be happy about the results and ensure that to do even more. Considering that the exercise was our first as a university, I am most delighted and appreciate all your contributions,” he said. Deputy Vice-Chancellor and Director of Academic Planning, Prof J.O. Fatokun, added that each of the programmes scored up to 80 per cent. “To the glory of God, all our programmes were accredited by the Commission. Even more, none of the programmes had an overall score below 80% while many scored well above 90%,” he said.
