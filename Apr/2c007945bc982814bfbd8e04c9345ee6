Bauchi Governor Bala Mohammed has disclosed two out of 78 artisans that came into the state from Port-Harcourt and Enugu state respectively have tested positive for coronavirus. The Governor made the disclosure at a media conference at the state Government House on the COVID-19 pandemic and efforts taken to contain it. Mohammad, who expressed dismay over the increasing number of confirmed cases in the state, said apart from the six index positive cases, including himself recorded in the state, the new cases are returnees from other states. He however said the total lockdown without palliative measures is not the solution to the COVID-19 pandemic, stressing that community ownership and active participation were the key to containing the virus. He also directed the isolation of all returnees or visitors coming into the state from high-risk states. Mohammed, who blamed border porosity for the new cases, said about 377 returnees have been quarantined so far, including the 198 Almajiris received from Plateau state. He said: ” We have so far traced 625 contacts, and the new cases we have recorded so far are not from the index case but from returnees from Lagos, Abuja, Kano , Enugu and Port -Harcout. ”Currently, we have a total of 29 confirmed cases , the number increased from 14 to 29 with in few days.
