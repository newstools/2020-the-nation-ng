 THE Chairman of Lagos State Law Reform Commission, Mr Kemi Pinheiro, on Thursday donated N1.5 million to the welfare fund meant to provide palliatives for 254 young lawyers of the Ikeja branch of the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA). Pinheiro who is also one of the patrons of the branch is leading other senior lawyers still contributing to the fund to lift their junior colleagues. The Chairman of the branch, Mr Dele Oloke said the branch envisaged early, that the coronavirus may cause a lockdown of the country. It therefore set up a six man committee named Ikeja branch Palliative Committee headed by Mrs Fausat Bakare to fashion out a way to cushion the effect of the pandemic on young lawyers of the branch.
