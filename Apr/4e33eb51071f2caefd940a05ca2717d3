Former Super Eagles attacker Richard Owubokiri may become the first Nigerian to be the president of a club in Brazil if his desire to vie for the exalted position at Esporte Clube Vitoria becomes fruition. Owubokiri  had two stints  with the club  between 1984 and 1986 and in 1994  and has  stayed over four decades in the South American country. He said it would be   right time for him to become the President of the club to ensure they return to the topflight from their present stint in Campeonato Brasiliero Serie B, adding it will be a fierce battle to displace the incumbent President, Paulo Carneiro who has been in the saddle for 30 years. “It was a fantastic experience and I have been in Brazil now for the last 40 years of my life. Now, I am working on becoming the President of the Vitoria football club,” Owubokiri reportedly  said in an interview with  SPNAfricanews.com “I will be the first Nigerian to achieve that feat if I eventually become successful. I was selected by some top fans of the club to contest for the  Presidential elections. “It will be tough because the incumbent and my challenger has been on that seat for over 30 years. Nevertheless, we have been working and praying for the best. I have gone round the world, learning about club management. “I have been to South Africa, England, France, Portugal, Argentina where I went to visit Boca Juniors and River Plate. I try to be updated at all times. Owubokiri said part of his plan if elected President is to ensure that more Africans ply their trade in the Brazilian league:”Like I said, the opponent is very strong but winning the election will represent another milestone in my life. If I win, I will definitely bring one or two African players over here to Brazil to join the club. The last time we saw an African player in Brazil was 40 years ago andI think that has been too long.”
