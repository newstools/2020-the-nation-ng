 THOUGH the Lagos State Police Command said it is yet to fix a date for the arraignment of controversial singer, Azeez Fashola, also known as Naira Marley and People’s Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain and former governorship aspirant in Lagos State, Babatunde Gbadamosi, indications are that they may face the court today. Both men were arrested by the police on Monday on the suspicion that they and other partygoers violated the Infectious Disease Regulation of Lagos State. An Ogba Magistrates’ Court on Monday, found Akindele and Bello guilty of the offence. Chief Magistrate Yewande Aje-Afunwa sentenced the couple to a 14-day community service and a fine of N100,000 each. The Command ordered Marley and the other guests to make themselves available or be declared wanted. Its Public Relations Officer (PRO) Mr Elkana Bala, a Deputy Superintendent (DSP), told The Nation that the proposed arraignments did not hold as there were no courts to hear the matter, following disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Bala said: “They will be arraigned, but no court is sitting now. Courts don’t sit on Tuesday. They have days they sit now because of this Coronavirus. They sat yesterday (Monday), the next sitting will be today.” The DSP had on Monday told The Nation that like Marley, Gbadamosi was detained with his wife at the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (SCIID) after they turned themselves in. A top official of the Ministry of Justice, who craved anonymity, affirmed Bala’s statement. He said some Magistrates’ Courts only sit on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, between 10am and 1pm following a March 30 directive from the Chief Judge, Justice Kazeem Alogba, in the wake of the COVID-19-induced lockdown. He hinted that the proposed arraignments would take place Wednesday.
