Emma Elekwa, Onitsha  Management of Iyi-Enu Hospital, Ogidi, Anambra State on Wednesday said a patient who recently returned from Abuja tested negative after undergoing the COVID-19 test in the hospital. Administrator of the Hospital, Rev. Tochukwu Okwuchukwu made the disclosure while interacting with State Information Officers on a monitoring mission over compliance with State Government directive in containing spread of the virus at the Hospital. He said the suspected individual, who came back from Abuja two weeks ago and developed cold, did not test positive to the disease. He said, “The suspected patient had pneumonia and our physicians prescribed antibiotics and discharged him. “Proactive measures are always being taken daily by the hospital when receiving patients.” Okwuchukwu who said there were no traces of the disease in the hospital, however, appealed to the State Government to provide facility with kits for testing for Coronavirus pandemic. He added, “Even though we are a mission hospital, we partner with the state government in times like this, in the service of humanity. “We make use of face masks, hand gloves and hand sanitiser but need more sophisticated equipment from government.’’ He praised the governor, Willie Obiano on efforts made to protect the state from the killer-disease, especially by providing isolation centres in various areas of the state. On her part, Chief Medical Officer, Mrs Edith Ochunwike said she was overwhelmed at the awareness created by Commissioner for Information, Mr C Don Adinuba on the virus and the way to stay safe.
