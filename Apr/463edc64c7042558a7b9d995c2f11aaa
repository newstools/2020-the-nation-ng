From Onimisi Alao, Yola  Gunmen attacked a village in Mayo Belwa, Adamawa State, on Sunday night and killed a youth, Seth Adamu. Our correspondent learnt Monday morning that the gunmen went for Seth Adamu at his residence in his village, Bekusun, and killed him for yet to be ascertained reason. Mayo Belwa has recently been associated with night killings and kidnapping, including the killing of southern Adamawa Zonal chairman of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN), Alhaji Saidu Kolaku, in August last year and the murder of a pastor and politician, Rev Denis Bagauri in January this year. While the killing of Kolaku was attributed to faceless kidnap kingpins who allegedly got back at him for exposing their activities, nobody has been able to give a clue to why Denis and other victims were killed. Similarly, nobody has been identified over the latest victim, Seth Adamu, who was a 28-year-old staff of the Mayo Belwa Local Government Council and son of a former member of the Adamawa State House of Assembly representing the Nasarawo-Biyeri constituency, late Adamu Kwante. The Mayo Belwa Local Government Council Information Officer, Kabiru Keli, confirmed Seth Adamu’s killing, saying the gunmen attacked Seth “last night.” “They attacked Bekusun village. The deceased is Seth, son of a former member, Kwante,” the information officer said. The Adamawa State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Suleiman Nguruje, told our correspondent Monday morning that he had not been briefed about Seth Adamu’s killing. “I am not yet aware of that,” the PPRO said on telephone to our correspondent, adding that he was busy participating in field effort by the police to enforce ongoing lockdown to prevent COVID-19 spread.
