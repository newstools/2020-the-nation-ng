 THE Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, has explained that the spike in the number of confirmed cases of Coronavirus (COVID-19) is due to “very strong ongoing community transmission.” He said during the daily briefing of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 on Wednesday in Abuja, that the renewed efforts by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to carry out more  tests was  also responsible for the increased positive COVID-19 cases. Ehanire  said: “Concerning the increased number of cases, there is the notion that community transmission is going on very strongly and therefore, increasing the cases of those infected with COVID-19. “It is also due to the improvement in testing and case finding. There is a renewed effort to do more aggressive testing by the NCDC – house-to-house testing and following any clusters that are of interest to increase the testing and to get more cases.” The minister added that the Federal Government was about to order “ over 100,000 cartridges of the GeneXpert machine through the Global Fund facility.” He explained that the GeneXpert machines have four modules which allow for the testing of   four samples at a time. “The  good thing about these machines  is that they give you  results in a much faster time –  say about 45 minutes to 1 hour,” Ehanire added. The Director-General of the NCDC, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, said that “95 to 98 per cent of COVID-19 patients recover, irrespective of medical intervention  and  depending on where they are.” He added: “Every state is at risk right now. So the idea that moving from one state to another qualifies you to be at higher risk really is no longer the case. “The measures recommended globally is the same measure we recommend for everyone. Therefore, whatever measures we have to do, we have to do it collectively – whether you are in the North, South, East or West.”
