Sensational Fuji musician Dauda Adewale Tekoma joined notable Nigerians to donate food items to the needy during the COVID-19 lockdown. The Fuji maestro feted the less-privileged during the lockdown occasioned by the deadly coronavirus pandemic. Wale Tekoma as he fondly called among his teeming fans, reached out with reliefs packaged to hundreds of Nigerians during this lockdown period to sustain their homes to curb the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the singer, “The reason why I gave out cash and food items, during this lockdown period, is because fingers are not equal, and some family cannot even afford the three square meal in a day and everyone understand that people are facing a lot of challenges, we all know there is a high level of hunger and poverty in the country.” Wale Tekoma has been in the Fuji music world for over three-decade after his breakthrough with the album titled, ‘Anything can happen’ in 1999. He is currently planning to release a new album, ‘Unification,’ featuring Pasuma Alabi and Sule Alao Malaika. Wale Tekoma’s last album titled ‘PYF – Pidgin Yoruba Fuji’ enjoyed acceptance among Fuji music lovers.
