 The Imo State Government has said there is no confirmed case of coronavirus yet in the state. The government also said it was committing every arsenal to win the war against the pandemic. Addressing journalists on Sunday, the chairman of the state Taskforce Committee on COVID-19, Prof. Maurice Iwu, said the committee had had some tests and they returned back negative. He said in spite of the fact that there had not been any recorded case in the state, the committee was not taking anything for granted. “Any report we get, we follow it up. And the NCDC has been of tremendous assistance to us. Also, we’re having unhindered access to the governor and that has helped us a lot,” Iwu said. He said the committee was collaborating with faith- based organisations to ensure that the fight against the pandemic was total.  “If we must prioritise what we’re doing, we must prevent it. Eighty percent of our work is preventing the virus. That’s why we’re bringing in the newly inaugurated local government areas interim chairmen. We must commit every arsenal to win this this war. If it means shutting the down any other thing in the state to win this wat, we will do it”, he said The committee also said the government was taking necessary statistics to know the vulnerable people in the state so as to make palliatives available to them. According to it, the state was not looking towards the federal government for any welfare package, announcing that within this week the distribution of the welfare package would commence.
