As a Government, our conscience is clear and we intended no harm whatsoever to anybody. All the measures we have taken so far, and all that we have done are in the best interest of our State and for the general good of our people.” Amaechi, on his part, said he stood with everyone working to defeat the Coronavirus describing the period of the pandemic as difficult, challenging and anxious. He said: “I want to let you know that I stand with everyone working to ensure that we defeat Coronavirus. This deadly pandemic is real and does not discriminate. “These difficult, challenging and anxious times will test our faith and resolve, but we must remember that in God lies the solution to all our worries. As we work together to beat this deadly virus, let us remain strong and resolute in our belief that God is still on the throne. “No matter the challenges of today, in the spirit of Easter, I appeal that we make the necessary sacrifices that will keep us safe & secure our tomorrow”.
