Meanwhile The Nation gathered that government may likely impose a 14-day lockdown on the state as part of measures to checkmate the pandemic. The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Health and member of the state COVID-19 Committee Dr Kabir Mustapha, who dropped the hint exclusively to our Correspondent via text message, said the government is thinking about imposing a lockdown of the state, though he didn’t provide further details. There has been growing calls in the state especially by Civil Society Groups and concerned citizens for the imposition of a 14 day lock down to enable the state government complete contact tracing on the index case, quarantine those identified, fumigate the state and improve on testing and screening of potential carriers.
