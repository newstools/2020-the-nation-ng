British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was on Thursday evening moved out of intensive care, but remained in hospital. A No. 10 spokesperson said the prime minister will receive close monitoring during the early phase of his recovery. “He is in extremely good spirits,” the spokesperson said. He was taken to hospital on Sunday – 10 days after testing positive – and was moved to intensive care on Monday. Mr Johnson received “standard oxygen treatment” in intensive care and was not put on a ventilator, Downing Street said earlier. He “continues to improve” after a “good night” and thanked the NHS for the “brilliant care” he has received, the spokesman added.
