 The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board has said the cut-off marks for this year’s admission has not been fixed. It urged Nigerians, particularly candidates, to disregard any cut-off mark being circulated by “fraudsters”, describing it as “fake.” The board said this year’s cut-off marks would be decided at a stakeholders’ policy meeting that would be chaired by the Minister of Education, Malam Adamu Adamu. JAMB’s Head of Media and Information Dr. Fabian Benjamin in a statement yesterday amid reports that the board had adopted a cut-off mark for this year’s admission said the board had fixed the policy meeting for June 15 and 16. He said: “Kindly disregard any cut-off mark paraded by fraudsters. It is fake news. “Cut-off marks are decided at a policy meeting chaired by the Hon. Minister of Education with all heads of tertiary institutions, CEOs of regulatory agencies in education and other critical stakeholders in attendance.  “This meeting has been fixed for June 15 and 16 all things being equal. “Until this meeting is held, nobody can talk of cut-off mark. Nigerians are advised to disregard any such marks being paraded.” The board has de-listed nine computer-based test centres (CBT) used in the conduct of this year’s Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination. One of the CBT centres was de-listed for conniving with candidates to engage in malpractice during the UTME. The remaining eight CBT centres were de-listed for “technical deficiency” during the conduct of the examination held on March 14.
