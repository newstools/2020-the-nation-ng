 Retirees under the Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS) have continued to receive their monthly pension despite the  lockdown on businesses aimed at containing the spread of coronavirus. A retiree, Uzoma, with the Police Pension PFA, said he received a message on April 14, stating that the company would not be able to pay due to Covid-19. The retiree, who contacted The Nation for help, was surprised by the message, wondering how he would survive without his pension,  during the lockdown. Allaying his fear, the Managing Director of the company said the message was fake and a ploy to scam retirees. He asked the retiree to check his account as he had paid retirees before April 15. Shortly after, the retiree called back, confirming that the money has been paid into his account. Another retiree, Ekanem, who receives pension by annuity through Leadway Assurance, claimed his pension was also not paid by April 15 when he usually receives his money.  Findings by The Nation showed that there was a system failure  during payment. After it was effected, the cash eventually went through into his account in the evening of April 15. Meanwhile, the National Pension Commission (PenCom) has said the  industry stakeholders have activated their business contingency arrangement to enable them continue  monthly payment to retirees. The arrangement was activated due to the lockdown arising from the pandemic that has shut many businesses globally. The Head of Corporate Communications, National Pension Commission (PenCom), Mr Peter Aghahowa, in a telephone interview said that the payment of retiree’s monthly pension was continuing unabated. Aghahowa said the operators before Covid-19 had put in place standard risk management to make their work easy. He stressed that is the most regulated sector in the country.
