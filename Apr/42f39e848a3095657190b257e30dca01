Other loan requests are also before the African Development Bank (AfDB) and other multilateral institutions. When approved, the loans will be used to address the impact of the coronavirus on the economy. The decision on whether the IMF will grant the $3.4 billion loan will be taken today when the Fund’s board meets.
