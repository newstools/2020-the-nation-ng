Ekiti State Government says another suspected case of Coronavirus, involving a 23-year-old man, is presently under close watch in the state. The government also gave details of the second case, whose positive status in the state was announced on Wednesday by the Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC), saying the patient was a 42-year-old male, an indigene of the state. Mrs Mojisola Yaya-Kolade, the state Commissioner for Health and Human Services, made the disclosure at a press conference, on Thursday in Ado-Ekiti. Yaya-Kolade noted that the male patient traveled often going by the nature of his job and had been in and out of the airport in Lagos in the past 14-days, which could account for his infection. She said the victim had already been admitted into the isolation center, Ado Ekiti, while the special environment team would soon disinfect his premises. While giving details of yet another case, which she said, was under close monitoring to determine his actual status, the commissioner, described him as a 23-year-old male, that had manifested some symptoms and is on ‘symptomatic treatment’ and investigation. “I can confirm that we have another suspected COVID-19 case, which is currently quarantined, pending the availability of his test result. “Ekiti has one discharged case, one positive case and one suspected case as at Thursday, April 2, 2020,” she said. Kolade enjoined the residents to comply with government’s directives to stay-at-home and observe preventive measures of frequent handwashing with soap, under running water and avoid bodily contact with anyone. Speaking on the challenges faced in fighting the pandemic in the state, the commissioner said Ekiti currently had only one ventilator in the state, adding that the state government was now sourcing for more ventilators.
