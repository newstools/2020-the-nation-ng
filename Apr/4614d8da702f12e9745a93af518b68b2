 BURNA Boy will join global stars including Lady Gaga, John Legend, Elton John and Billie Eilish to raise funds and address the fight against coronavirus. Other international stars scheduled to join the movement ahead of the programme on April 19 are Finneas, Idris and Sabrina Elba, and Jimmy Fallon. The two-hour program will be hosted by marquee personalities from each of the major networks. It will include both live and pre-taped performances from the world’s most prominent artists with multimillion-Naira pledges to the WHO’s Solidarity Response Fund. The show will lift viewer’s spirits in these trying times with exclusive and unique cameos from the worlds of music and arts, sports superstars, and comedic sketches, while always drawing back to its core purpose to educate and inform on COVID-19 risks, prevention and response. The broadcast is also expected to feature interviews with experts from WHO as well as stories of frontline healthcare workers from around the world. The programme is building on the success of the digital series “One World: Together at Home.” The programme is a joint effort between Global Citizen and the World Health Organization (WHO) and will air across BET/Comedy Central/MTV/MTV base on Sunday, April 19. ‘Together at Home,’ was launched with Chris Martin of Coldplay on March 16, 2020, and has gone ahead to become an outlet for artists to share music with their fans for a purpose, to educate and inform millions around WHO’s critical effort to prevent, detect and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.
