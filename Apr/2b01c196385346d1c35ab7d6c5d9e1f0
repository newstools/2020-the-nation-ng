Scores of youths in Isuofia, Aguata Local Government Area, Anambra State yesterday protested alleged laying of cables suspected to be for the controversial 5G Technology Network in the community. The protest reportedly lent credence to a statement credited to leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, alleging the laying of 5G Technology Network cables in the state while residents were compelled to observe stay-at-home over the coronavirus pandemic. A resident of the area who preferred anonymity said the youths had confronted the firm, warning them that the exercise would put their lives at risk.  He said the officials of the company, whose identity could not be ascertained as there was no inscription on their equipment, denied the allegation, claiming that they were installing a 4G Technology Network cable. The Nation however learnt that the youths insisted they must stop work and leave the community for peace to reign. Reacting, the traditional minister of the community, Chief Ndubisi Osele, blamed the protest on misinformation. He said: “Some miscreants misinformed the youths in the community that 5G Technology Network was being installed in the community. “What is being laid underground is fiber cables, not 5G Network; 5G Technology Network is a band placed on the Mast, it is not laid under the ground.”
