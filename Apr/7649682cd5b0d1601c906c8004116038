THE Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has warned the Federal Government against borrowing from the N10.2 trillion pension fund to cushion the effects of Covid-19 pandemic. Its President, Comrade Ayuba Wabba gave the warning during the Joint National Briefing of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 in Abuja. Ayuba stressed that the over N10 trillion pension fund is money that belongs to pensioners, which is in pensioner’s retirement savings accounts. He explained that the fund is structured in such a way that a pensioner draws from it throughout his life. He noted that there was the need to protect the fund and ensure that pensioners or the workers contributing the money would have something to rely on. He maintained that the money should not be used for COVID-19 palliatives. The Secretary to the Government of the Federation and Chairman of the Presentational Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19, Boss Mustapha, assured that the Federal Government would not borrow from Fund to provide palliatives to cushion the effect of COVID-19 lockdown. He said: “We had looked at the issue of pension funds. As a matter of fact, we even got the Minister of State of Education to do us a position paper and our conclusion is that the time is not even right for us to go there because the entire world order in terms of our economy and in terms of our health system has been disrupted by COVID-19 and the consequences nobody can imagine until the dust is settled.”
