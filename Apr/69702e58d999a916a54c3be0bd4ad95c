By Kofoworola Belo-Osagie  Some COVID-19 patients in the Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) Yaba have produced a video to improve awareness about the virus and thank health workers for nursing them back to health. The video was shared on Twitter by Moji Delano, @mojidekanoblog Wednesday afternoon featured some 12 patients in a file bearing written messages which they flashed before the camera as the danced away. The patients, among whom were three foreigners, wore face masks and covers that largely obscured their identities in one of the wards of the hospital. Some of the messages they bore reads: “Health workers also have families but they can’t stay at home; please stay safe; stay alive. #Lagoscividgang2020.”; “It is real; we are living through this but we are confident we will overcome together; kudos to Lagos and its amazing team”; “Hey people, we are foreigners here and we are begging you to stay home for your relatives’ sake;” “many thanks to the health workers; they have been a blessing.”
