Taofik Salako, Deputy Business Editor Nigerian Aviation Handling Company (Nahco) Plc has attributed the delay in the completion of its financial statement to disruptions caused by the Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. In a regulatory filing at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), Nahco stated that its audited financial statement for the year ended December 31, 2019 has not been completed due to disruptions of the auditing process by the impact of Covid-19. According to the company, the meeting of its board of directors which had been scheduled to hold on April 8, 2020 with the main agenda to consider and approve the 2019 audited financial statements and recommend the payment of dividend was postponed until further notice due to the delay. Nahco had posted gross revenue of N7.38 billion for the nine–month period ended September 30, 2019. Profit before tax stood at N973.1 million for the period, N241.3 million or 32.96 per cent higher than the amount for the same period of 2018. Profit after tax rose by 30 per cent to N782 million in third quarter 2019 compared with the N601.31 million in third quarter 2018. Earnings per share stood at 48 kobo as at the end of the third quarter of 2019 compared to 37 kobo as earnings per share as at the end of the third quarter of 2018. The board had appointed a new management for the company which early 2019 embarked on a five –year transformation plan. These include continuing upgrade of equipment, warehouses and other facilities at the airports. On the company’s results, Group Managing Director,  NAHCO, Mrs. Olatokunbo Fagbemi said she was delighted that the company was making progress on all fronts. “NAHCO is in a good place. Apart from being the industry leader in ground handling in West Africa, we are also providing leadership in supporting our partners, the cargo agents, in the important skills of packaging for export,” Mrs Fagbemi said. She noted that in the period that the new management took over, the company had increased the capacity of its export warehouse and is currently renovating its import warehouse. She said Nahco is also taking advantage of opportunities emanating from Federal Government’s closure of the land borders as it is partnering stakeholders on proper packaging for their products for exports.
