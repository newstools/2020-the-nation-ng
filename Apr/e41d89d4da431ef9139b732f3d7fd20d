 THE human ego is falling on its knee Like a violent storm in the middle of the sea How on earth do we make it still When our masters are themselves ill This pandemic defies the charisma of scientists Two months down the line of these bestial antics Uncertainty is the cloud that envelops our vision Picketing the economic and social lives of great nations And although we know the world is at war point Our weaponry we know not where to point  We are angry and sober We lament and are sombre Here we mourn, here we grief As death wins some after a sick so brief Many more will have to suffer Many more will die of hunger Our fates hang in the balance Even for them in the palace Death is the ultimate fear that grips our jugular The ultimate end that makes COVID-19 so popular  At the centre of the apocalyptic pandemonium Is human’s wickedness from millenniums Human’s ego that craves superpower Human’s error that exposes the powers Human’s transgression that calls for atonement And human’s judgement that brings us to judgement This great evil cannot be from the one who owns the universe For it is clear from the divine law that karma is a case of vice versa It is no longer a joke that many eggs have lost their yoke And the glitz of New York is not like the days of yore  As the reality of time hits us in the face It gets harder not to touch our face The need to wash our hands Rings a bell in our head We cannot wash our hands The number of times we use our hands The distance from hand to mouth Indicts us more than the gap from mob Staying more at home makes more sense For the risks won’t prey on you in your absence  Countries have shut borders to strangers That there be no regrets of diplomatic dangers Just as States now shut gates to countrymen To curtail the spread of ominous maim My countrymen take to the fashion Not having the elements that make a perfect fusion Now we dine with more hunger As soldiers enforce their licensed anger We are told to die of hunger at home And not by a virus in a nursing home  The jamboree of Nigerian politics takes a new beat Half a loaf for a million drumbeats If we ever get out of this alive Perhaps we’d use our head at polling hive How we had long eaten our today At the instance of yesterday’s voting pay Now our conscience cries for a probe As our faulty choice desecrates the throne We know our leaders who know us not We love our leaders who love themselves nuts  What do we gain from this marriage of imbalance That holes us in solitary ambiance We are near but yet so far Our guts they often fear Even our voice is hate speech The voice of conscience that we pitch Many a death confronts us at this end We cannot wait for this to reach its wits’ end The world is on lockdown Ours is obviously a lockup  Leaders who love their people pay rents and take foods to their doorstep For us, throwing crumbs to their goal post is for us another political step In our selfish journey to 2023 Pray we live to see beyond 2023 For here is a new sheriff in town He will not let the mighty seek refuge out of town Now Warri is up in arms against its soldiers Soldiers who should hold the people in their shoulders There is a spoil for fight in other communities With a rise from a frog jump to self-taken justice  I weep for Nigeria, my tears from eyes so hollow Deep from the pains of yesterday, today and tomorrow For the future of my children and children’s children For the retirement and old age that I dread For this suffering in the midst of plenty For a solution that is so empty For we move far and far from the right foundation For what looks like the agony of terminally ill nation As great nations are held in momentary cry I know not when my monumental tears will dry
