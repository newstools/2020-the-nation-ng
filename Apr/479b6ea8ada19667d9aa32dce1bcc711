  Second Coming Nigeria Limited, a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) company, has donated 35,000 litres of LPG (cooking gas) to Abia State Government as palliative to cushion the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the citizens. The Managing Director of the company, Dr. Basil Ogbuanu, who made the donation at the Office of the Secretary to the State Government (SSG) in Umuahia, Abia State capital, said it is part of the company’s support to government’s efforts at curbing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ogbuanu who was represented by the company’s Accountant, Mr Oken Maduabuchi, said the product should be distributed freely to residents “so that people will have gas to cook their food.” He said the product, worth N5.5 million, was the company’s modest contribution toward alleviating the plight of the people occasioned by the lockdown. He commended the state government for its demonstrable efforts and commitment in ensuring that Abia State remained free of the coronavirus pandemic. He also appealed to LPG operators to support government towards stamping out the pandemic in Nigeria. Ogbuanu, however commended the federal and state governments for the frantic efforts they made to control the rapid spread of the disease. He expressed happiness with the professionalism exhibited by the doctors and other health workers in the fight against the pandemic, adding that their giant strides had shown that Nigeria has professionals who could compete favourably with their colleagues in other parts of the world. He urged Nigerians to adhere strictly to the directives issued by the government on the precautionary measures against the disease, stressing that complying to the directives is in the interest of everybody. Abia State Deputy Governor, Ude Oko-Chukwu, thanked Ogbuanu and the company’s management for deeming it necessary to support the government in its efforts to alleviate the impact of the lockdown on the citizenry.
