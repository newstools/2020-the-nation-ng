Reckitt Benckiser (RB), makers of JIK, has donated 100 cartons of products to Lagos State to support its fight against Coronavirus. Country Manager of RB Hygiene West Africa Asif Hashimi said: “This is a critical time and RB, makers of JIK, is proud to partner the Lagos State government in the fight against COVID-19. This contribution is in line with JIK’s efforts at containing the pandemic. “Over the years, Nigerians have come to trust JIK to keep their homes in good sanitary state and help curb the spread of infectious diseases. JIK is safe for the environment as it kills 99.9 per cent of illness-causing germs. This has been corroborated by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) as part of precautions that should be adopted to help with prevention, among other measures. “JIK can be used on numerous surfaces, including door knobs, stair railing, floors, kitchen slabs, table tops, bathrooms and toilet surfaces. It can also be used to wash clothes and fumigate open places. We are optimistic that this humble contribution will support the government’s efforts to stem the tide of Coronavirus.” Director of Sanitation Services in the Ministry of Environment Dr. Hassan Sanuth hailed Reckitt Benckiser for the gesture. He promised that the products would be put to use. Other household items made by Reckitt Benckiser include Dettol, Mortein, Harpic, Airwick, Durex, Nurofen and Gaviscon. Beverage manufacturers, Real Drinks Company Limited, also donated 17,500 cartons of Real Refresh Juice to the government to support health workers in the fight against Coronavirus. The donation was done between April 7 and 10. Chief Operating Officer Wayne Erlank said: “We appreciate the sacrifices and efforts of medical personnel who risk their lives daily by caring for the sick. Providing the front-line personnel with a variety of our natural fruit flavoured drinks is our way of ensuring that they are continuously refreshed.”
