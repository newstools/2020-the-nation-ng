Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr has reportedly requested the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) to include coach Salisu Yusuf as one of his assistants if he puts pen to paper. Yusuf was one of the German’s coaching lieutenants until he was handed a one-year ban after the infamous  ‘Anas video scandal ‘ but impeccable sources to the NFF informed the erstwhile Nigerian international is on his way back to the Super Eagles. After serving his one year ban, Yusuf was seconded by the NFF to  Rangers International Football Club as Technical Adviser and Rohr is said to be toying with the idea of bringing in back. ” I know for sure that Salisu was in constant communication with Rohr during his One-year ban,” the usual reliable source told NationSport. “Rohr and Salisu had a good working relationship and he was very loyal to the Eagles’ boss. “As such, Rohr has confidence and trust in him. “Now that  the NFF wants him (Rohr) to be domiciled  in Nigeria as one of the conditions for a contract extension, he needs  someone like Salisu to assist him especially with players from the domestic league.” “Rohr is an experienced and intelligent tactician who knows how to get his job done and I  believe the current Rangers Adviser would be his best choice. “Of course, Joseph Yobo is there already but he is new on the job with little or no experience in coaching; so  including Salisu into his coaching crew will make his job less difficult with emphasis on the Nigerian league.” Speaking further, the source informed that many Super Eagles stars in Europe are backing Rohr and have advised the former Bayern Munich defender to accept the new contract from the NFF. But efforts made to reach Rohr proofed abortive as he did not respond to messages on his readiness to work with Yusuf in his forthcoming spell as Super Eagles coach.
