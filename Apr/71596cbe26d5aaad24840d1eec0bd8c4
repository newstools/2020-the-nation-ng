 THE Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has expressed profound shock and a sense of deep sorrow at the passage on Saturday of Mallam Abba Kyari, Chief of Staff to His Excellency President Muhammadu Buhari (GCFR). “Mallam Abba Kyari’s death is a big loss to the NFF, Nigerian Football family and the entire country as a whole,”  stated NFF’s director of communications, Ademola Olajire. “Nigeria’s football industry has lost a friend and a great man who showed tremendous interest in the progress of the country’s game. He was, indeed, a colossus.” Olajire said the NFF retains abiding fond memories of Mallam Kyari’s love and support for the various National Teams, accentuated by the passion, energy and resolve with which the Cambridge –educated lawyer and former banking titan attended to, and presented to President Buhari, matters concerning the teams. “The NFF never had reason, even for one day, to doubt Mallam Kyari’s commitment to the development of Nigerian football and the National Teams. He had keen interest in the teams and treated matters concerning them and Nigerian football generally with his well-known empathy and utmost sense of duty. “In his interactions with the leadership of NFF and even the teams, Mallam Kyari was an embodiment of simplicity, humanity and integrity. His personal presence at the airport in Abuja to receive the victorious Super Falcons’ contingent to the Women Africa Cup of Nations competition in Ghana in December 2018 only underscored his passion and keen interest in matters of the National Teams and Nigeria football.
