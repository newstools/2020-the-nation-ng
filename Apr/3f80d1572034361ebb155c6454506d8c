From Eric Ikhilae, Abuja  The National Judicial Council (NJC) has recommended the immediate compulsory retirement of two judges for acts of misconduct. The NJC, in a statement, identified the affected judicial officers as Aliyu Musa Liman (of the Bauchi State High Court) and Chukwuma Francis Abosi (the Acting President of the Customary Court of Appeal, Imo State) Liman was said to have withheld judgment in a case, marked: BA/100/210 between Abubakar Isa and Sheik Tahir Usman Bauchi, for almost four years, as against the three months period provided by the Constitution. On his party, Abosi was said to have altered his date of birth from 1950 to 1958 to beat his actual retirement year of 2015 when he originally attained the mandatory retirement age of 65 years.
