Kano State Road Traffic Agency (KAROTA) said on Monday that 350 commuters were arrested for violating the movement restriction order in the state. The order was for them to reduce their passenger load from four to two persons per seat. Some of the arrested persons were drivers, others passengers. Spokesman of the agency Nabilusi Abubakar told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Kano that 35 vehicles were also intercepted. NAN reports that recently Kano state government ordered all commercial vehicle drivers to reduce the number of passengers they usually carried and tricycle riders should carry only two passengers. According to Abubakar, the people arrested were forced to go back to where they were coming from, while the vehicle owners will be taken to court after the lockdown. He further explained that since the commencement of the lockdown, no tricycle operator was arrested for violating the instruction.
