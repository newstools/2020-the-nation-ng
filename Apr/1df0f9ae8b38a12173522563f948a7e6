 The Nigeria Olympic Committee (NOC) has lauded the Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare on his outstanding achievements within the first six months in office. Recounting the giant strides of the Minister, the President of Nigeria Olympic Committee (NOC) and Member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), Habu Gumel, commended the Minister on his visionary leadership which has helped in re-positioning Nigerian sports. “The Honourable Minister was instrumental to the speedy completion of the new headquarters building of the Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa (ANOCA), which then led to the visit of the President of International Olympic Committee, His Excellency, Dr. Thomas Bach to Nigeria in November 2019 to commission the edifice.  The new ANOCA Secretariat is now the pride of African sports and has elevated the status of Abuja as Olympic Capital of Africa” he said.  “The Minister has been passionate and ensured the participation of Nigerian athletes and teams in Olympic Qualification championships which has enabled us to secure the qualification places that we currently have.  With the rescheduling of the Olympic Games, we still have some windows of opportunities to qualify more athletes,” said Gumel. ”Even before the Olympic Games was shifted, the Nigeria Olympic Committee, through the commitment of the Hon. Minister, has complied with all the timelines established by the Organising Committee and effected the required deposit payments,” Gumel said.
