A new batch of 23 Nigerian returnees from Togo Republic arrived at the Seme Border Post in Lagos State on Sunday. According to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), the 23 Nigerians came from different parts of the world and were airlifted into Lome by Ethiopian Airlines over two weeks ago. An official of Port Health Services (PHS) in Seme, who pleaded anonymity, told NAN that one of the 24 returnees that tested positive to COVID-19 was held by Togolese authorities. “The remaining 23 were isolated for 14 days and laboratory examination conducted by the Togo health authorities showed that they are all negative. The results from Togo are here with us. “We have informed officials of Lagos State Ministry of Health and they are on their way to Seme border to evacuate the returnees to Yaba for more examination on COVID-19,” he said. The 67 returnees from Ivory Coast, who arrived the Seme Border on April 8 in a luxurious bus with registration number Osun XA 240 EJG, are in 14 days quarantine in Badagry where they are undergoing COVID-14 tests.
