Lagos State, Nigeria’s main economic centre and traditionally the city centre of stock market transactions is the epicentre of the Coronavirus pandemic. President Muhammadu Buhari had ordered a total lockdown of Lagos State, alongside the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), and Ogun State. The NSE subsequently closed its trading floors nationwide and transited to fully digital remote operations on Wednesday March 25, 2020. Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) Mr. Oscar Onyema said the Exchange is committed to ensuring that its operations and trading activities continue seamlessly throughout this trying period. According to him, since the activation of its business continuity plan in response to COVID-19 on Wednesday, March 25, 2020, the Exchange has transitioned to digital operations with its employees working remotely and dealing member firms trading remotely. He pointed out that the Exchange has had no disruptions to its operations since the activation of the slow down efforts by state and federal governments to flatten the Covid-19 curve. “We have put in place the requisite measures to guarantee that our staff are able to provide requisite support, our stakeholders are able to conduct business digitally, and that all relevant information continues to flow into the market to spur capital market activity during the Covid-19 pandemic,” Onyema said.
