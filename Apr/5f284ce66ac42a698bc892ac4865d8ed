Plateau United goalkeeper Oladele Ajiiboye has urged the League Management Company (LMC) to hand the Nigeria Professional Football League title to Plateau United should the League filed to resume as a result of COVID-19 pandemic. Ajiboye said the COVID-19 case was quite unfortunate and he never imagined that an occurrence like this could put the whole world on hold. “Football is a game of contact where there is no room for social distance in the field of play,” he said.“ Health is life and one needs to be alive to be healthy;  a situation like this has happened before in Nigeria football (though not health-related)when Lobi Stars were adjudged winner of the 2017/2018 season due to force majeure following changes in  CAF calendar. “ Plateau United should also be accorded the same privilege and awarded the crown if the pandemic persists and the League cannot be concluded,” added Ajiboye, who won the 2007 FIFA World Under -17 Championship in Korea. The 29-year-old former Prime FC of Osogbo goaltender said that the players are highly motivated by the management of the club and hailed the technical ability of the team under coach Abdu Maikaba. Plateau United led the NPFL table with 49 points from 25 matches before the lockdown as a result of COVID-17 and they were closely followed by Rivers United with 45 points and Lobi Stars with 43 points with the same number of matches.
