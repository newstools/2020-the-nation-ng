One of President Muhammadu Buhari’s daughters, who went into self-isolation on her return from the United Kingdom (UK) on March 18, is out. First Lady Hajia Aisha Buhari broke the news in a tweet on her verified Tweeter handle @aishambuhari. She tweeted: “It is a thing of joy and gratitude to Almighty God to reunite with my daughter after she had been in isolation for 14 days immediately she landed in Nigeria. “While I’m wishing all those infected for a speedy recovery, I pray for the end of this pandemic. #AbujaScaleUp.” The First Lady had earlier clarified that her daughter’s self-isolation was not because she had displayed any Coronavirus symptoms. She had tweeted: “Good afternoon Nigerians…my daughter returned from the UK being among the high burden-listed countries of COVID-19. “Based on the advice of the Hon. Minister of Health, Presidential Taskforce on COVID – 19 and that of NCDC (National Center for Disease Control), she is on self-isolation, not because she displayed any symptoms of COVID-19. “Please, I urge all parents to do the same if possible as prevention is better than cure. “Similarly, I have shut down my office for two weeks with immediate effect while essential staff can work from home as a result of some staff who recently returned from the UK.”
