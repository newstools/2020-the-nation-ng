There have been torrents of tributes for a former Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Chief Richard Osuolale Akinjide. But one indelible aspect of his life was the legal tussle over 1979 presidential election over which he rattled the Supreme Court on what ought to be 12 2/3 of the then 19 states. The legal battle changed the scope of Law studies in Nigeria because it set the precedent for making a credit in Mathematics as one of the prerequisites for reading Law in any Nigerian university. Posterity will never forget him for this.
