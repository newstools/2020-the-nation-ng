  MINISTER of Interior Rauf Aregbesola on Wednesday said measures were being taken to ensure that COVID-19 does not spread to custodial centres (prisons). He said the disruption at the Kaduna State Prison on Tuesday was effectively managed. The minister noted that the centres in major cities were congested, which poses a risk to inmates. On the Kaduna incident, Aregbesola said: “There was a mild disturbance and it was put under control. “It happened because the inmates in the condemned section were anxious to know the outcome of our efforts to decongest some of the centres and they became agitated.” He praised the Judiciary for shutting down courts and the Police hierarchy for ordering the release of detained minor offenders. Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, said the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC) had directed cable television service providers to make local channels free to their subscribers when subscriptions expire. He said this will keep the public informed during the lockdown. Mohammed also said banks have been permitted to open for services. According to him, the Minister of Works and Housing Babatunde Fashola had approved the suspension of construction works till April 20 to allow for social distancing.
