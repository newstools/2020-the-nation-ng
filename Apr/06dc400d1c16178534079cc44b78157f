Veteran stand-up comedian, Ali Baba says rising comedians in Nigeria can earn good money in three months if they are good enough. The famous Nigerian entertainer made this known on an Instagram live program tagged ‘The Shift conference’ hosted by Business and development coach, Alex Adefmi. Ali baba further revealed how Nigerians do not believe in talents and how popular singer Asa’s music was not appreciated here in Nigeria till she moved to Paris for a show where she became famous and hit the limelight. “Nigerians don’t believe in talents, they did not believe it was a service I was providing and they were ready to just treat it anyhow. I finally broke through that period. It took me 7 years to make money as a comedian, but now a comedian can in three months if he is good to begin to earn good money, what I am saying is that the appreciation of talent is a problem, the platform that we have to grow this talent is a problem, the remuneration of this talent is a problem, but then again you also have to consider the earning power of the people in the society because if somebody has not eaten, piracy is close to him, he would rather buy a pirated tape than pay 700 Naira to buy a disc that he can get for 200 Naira or 100 Naira.” Ali Baba who spoke on the topic ‘how can entertainment begin to maximize technology in a post-civil, digital world?, he said moving forward comedy shows will witness low turnout unlike before but the best bet for comedians and entertainers will be to take the content and put it on Netflix adding that their quality of videos will have to be upgraded. However, he noted that if entertainers make good use of their digital space, it will force sponsors to come through for them.
