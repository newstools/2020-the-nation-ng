Foremost auto company in Nigeria, Massilia Motors, (sole distributor of Mitsubishi Motors in Nigeria), has provided food items to 1000 homes at Ijora in Lagos, where the companyâ€™s headquarters is located. Food items including bags of rice, beans, sugar, salt, vegetable oil, pasta, tomato and pastes among others were handed over to Ojora of Ijora Oba Abdul Fatai Aremu Aromire by a Massilia Motors team led by the Deputy Managing Director, Mr. Kunle Jaiyesimi. While commending the efforts of government in checking the spread of COVID-19, the DMD said the gesture was a way of alleviating the hardship the COVID-19 lockdown may have on the people in the neighbouring community. It would be recalled that President Muhammadu Buhari recently imposed a lockdown on Lagos and Ogun states as well as the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) as a measure to cope with the spread of Covid-19 in the country. Masilia Motors is a joint venture of CFAO and Chanrai Group, focused on automotive needs in Nigeria.
