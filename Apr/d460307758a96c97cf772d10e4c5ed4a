 THE Board of the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, (LASUTH), has donated Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to frontline medical personnel involved in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic in the State. Speaking while handing over the items on Friday, the Chairman of the Board, Dr. Richardson Ajayi, commended the efforts of the management and staff of the hospital for their diligence and resilience in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. He observed that the efforts and professionalism displayed by staff to contain the spread of COVID-19, as well as their doggedness in caring for the affected patients have indeed made them unsung heroes during these perilous times. “The dexterity with which the staff and management team kept the operations of the hospital going, while handling the complexities of leadership during this period, is worthy of emulation,” he said. Dr. Ajayi expressed the determination of the board to continue to render all necessary support to the management of the hospital in order to ensure the successful implementation of policies instituted to achieve maximum effectiveness and efficiency in the facility. Receiving the donated items, which included protective gowns, surgical masks, latex gloves and N95 face masks, on behalf of the hospital, the Chief Medical Director, Prof. Adetokunbo Fabamwo, expressed gratitude to the Board for their gesture, words of encouragement and for identifying with the plight of the frontline medical personnel. He promised the Board that the donated items would be disbursed rationally and efficiently for optimal use. Similarly, the Heart Emergency Initiative, a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) that had previously helped in paying medical bills of poor patients at the Emergency Unit of the hospital, has also extended a hand of support to the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH) by donating some PPE to the facility on Friday.
