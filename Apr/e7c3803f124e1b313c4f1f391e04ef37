Emma Elekwa, Onitsha  Primary and secondary schools students in Anambra State have expressed appreciation to Governor Wilie Obiano for the migration of classrooms to radio, television and Facebook program titled, “Anambra Teaching on Air’. The online learning program being organised by the Ministry of Basic Education in collaboration with the Anambra Broadcasting Service (ABS) was introduced to bridge the gap resulting from the closure of schools to prevent the spread of coronavirus. They said the governor has once more demonstrated his love for the Anambra child, noting that through the program, they would no longer be adversely affected by the closure of schools, occasioned by the coronavirus pandemic. One of the students, Master Okwudili Umegbolu of Community Secondary School Agulu, while hailing the governor for the laudable initiative, appreciated the Basic Education Commissioner, Prof Kate Omenugha and Education family for driving the process. He stressed the need for parents and guardians to be sensitized on the importance of allowing their children and wards to be part of the program. On her part, Miss Chidumaga Nnaemeka of St Mary the Virgin Convent Ufuma thanked Governor Obiano, Commissioner Omenugha and Chief Executive Officer of the ABS, Chief Uche Nwora for providing alternative and unique platforms for their lessons, which the coronavirus pandemic attempted to trauncate. She promised to inform her fellow students to be part of the exercise in order to cover the gap occasioned by the closure of schools.
