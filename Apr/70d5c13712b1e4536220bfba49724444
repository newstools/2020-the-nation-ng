Despite the suspension of football due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Super Eagles forward is strongly linked with a switch to Manchester United but has been advised by former Golden Eaglets Coach, Emmanuel Amuneke to ensure he gets a club that offers him regular playing time. The 21-year-old joined Lille last summer from Belgian club Charleroi and has scored 18 times in 38 appearances in all competitions. Speaking with NationSport, Amuneke said: “Victor has been very impressive for Lille. It’s an option that has to be weighed by Victor and his club but I think it’s a good thing that big clubs are knocking on the door, which shows he has the potential to play in bigger clubs and quality to continue to develop. “Man United is a very big club and if the opportunity comes for him – there’s nothing wrong for him going there but he must look at the situation and circumstances because he needs to play. “When you play week-in-week-out that’s the only way you will continue to improve as a player – individually and collectively within what the team requires. We shouldn’t forget that Victor is just 21 but the good thing is that he is progressing fine and his development is an encouraging one, ”noted Amuneke who blooded the striker during his days with the national u-17 team.
