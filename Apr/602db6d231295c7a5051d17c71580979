Liverpool have reportedly begun the process of signing Lille star Victor Osimhen by opening talks with the player’s representatives, according to reports. The 21-year-old is having a stunning debut season for the French side, and Lille are said to value the player at £60million if he is to leave in the summer. Le10Sport in France report that Liverpool are at the front of the queue to sign him, and have set the ball rolling by speaking to his agent. Manchester United, Leicester and Chelsea have also been credited with an interest in the young striker, with the latter making Lille aware they are keen if they decide to sell. Osimhen has scored 18 goals in 38 appearances in all competitions for the Ligue 1 side, having arrived from Charleroi in Belgium last summer. He is a Nigerian international, and Odion Ighalo is among the players to have heaped praise on his ability. The Manchester United loanee called him the ‘future of Nigerian football’, and there are expected to be some big bids made for him when the transfer window opens following the coronavirus crisis. Osimhen, meanwhile, has previously spoken of his ambitions to play in England during his career, while also warning interested parties that he will not settle for a role warming the bench.
