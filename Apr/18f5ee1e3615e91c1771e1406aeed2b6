Some married women in Ado-Ekiti on Wednesday say the ‘stay-at-home’ order occasioned by the coronavirus pandemic, has turned out to be a blessing in guise for them. Speaking to News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Correspondent, the women noted that the lockdown had forced their husbands to have time for the family. Mrs Iyabo Obayemi, a civil servant, said in her 10 years of marriage, she and her husband never stayed together for 24 hours uninterrupted, adding that she was happy with the stay-at-home directive of the governor. She said her husband worked in Lagos, and that had been a major challenge for the family since she could not resign her job to live with him, and vice versa. She expressed happiness as she had been inseparable from her husband for some days now, while the children were excited over their father’s presence at home without having to go out to see friends or relatives. Another woman, Mrs Toyin Bewaji, said she was happy to reunite with her husband as the earliest time he had always arrived home was 11pm when the children would have slept. She said her joy knew no bound as her husband had been participating in morning prayers and also helping with chores such as laundry and even helping in the kitchen. Mrs Dupe Onipede said she was happy to see her husband spending time with her and the children, saying the lockdown had brought her husband closer to her. She lamented the way her husband had always been coming home late and therefore lauded government for shutting all joints of social activities in the state. “This has make my husband to have a change of attitude towards us. “For the past two days now, my husband had been with us,” she stressed.
