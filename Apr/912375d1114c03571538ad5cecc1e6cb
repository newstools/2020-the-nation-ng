Suspected land grabbers have gone after a man after killing his brother. In the last two weeks, Olusegun Akinde, spokesman to popular Isheri-Osun land agent Chief Taoreed Faronbi (Alado), said, the killers have been trying to silence him, after killing his brother Samson Akinde alias Eletu. Akinde, a member of the Fagbile clan of Isheri-Osun that has been locked in boundary disputes with the Amuwo-Kuje family at Whitesand area, appealed for police protection from the assailants, claiming he has fled his home for fear of being killed. Eletu was attacked by thugs last month while going to the venue of a botched meeting between the Fagbile and Amuwo-Kuje families aimed at solving the dispute which has lasted for many years, resulting in loss of lives. It was gathered that the deceased got information the hoodlums were going to invade the meeting and moved in to warn his kinsmen, not knowing they had fled the venue after observing suspicious movements. While on his way, the hoodlums allegedly saw him, attacked and killed. Police spokesman Bala Elkana said three persons were in custody for Eletuâ€™s murder.
