 GOVERNORS on Wednesday expressed concern that Nigerians have continued to disregard the inter-state lockdown announced Monday to halt movement across states and mitigate the spread of COVID-19. The governors, during a virtual meeting of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) held on Wednesday, resolved to work with the police and other relevant stakeholders to enforce the ban on inter-state movement. “Governors are concerned with the continued movement of people across states despite the enforcement of inter-State lockdowns across states. “The forum will collaborate with the Nigeria Police Force to provide increased security, as well as the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW)  and LGA Chairmen in the States to strengthen security surveillance along State boarders,” the NGF said in a communique issued at the end of the meeting. The forum was also concerned about the rising number of health workers now infected with COVID -19 and resolved to work on ways to ensure enhanced protection for them. It said: “In the light of rising cases of infections among health workers, State governments will engage with their health workers to provide other incentives, including insurance cover or allowances as may be required. According to the communique made available late on Wednesday by NGF’s spokesman, Abdulrazaqe Bello-Barkindo, the governors also resolved to work with the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) for further training and logistic supports for health workers across the country.
