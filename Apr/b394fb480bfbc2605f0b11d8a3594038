He further stated that there are new discoveries about coronavirus. “For instance, it is not a straightforward respiratory problem. We have found out that it impacts the blood, the kidneys. “There are many ways to carry out a diagnosis, a test is just a confirmation “The common denominator are diabetes, hypertension, and underlying immunological problems. Obesity is also a possible risk factor. We watch such people closely. If you fall into any of these categories, you have to be very careful,” he said.
