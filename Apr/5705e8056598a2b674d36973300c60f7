 EDO State Commissioner of Police Lawan Jimeta has stated that weekend’s explosion at Dumez Street on Benin–Auchi Roadwas not from an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) but from electrical appliances dumped in a pit. He said on Monday that the electrical appliances were dumped in a pit by an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) expert, Muhammed Hamzat, stressing that investigation into the incident was ongoing. Jimeta also said that one person was arrested over Sunday’s killing of a young man on Lagos Street, Benin, over an isolated cult clash, which he insisted was not a renewed cult war in the state.
