Enugu State High Court has restrained Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, from harsssing executives of Enugu State All Progressives Congress (APC). Also restrained were Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Adamu Muhammed, Onyeama’s Personal Assistant Flavour Eze and the officer in charge of the IG’s Intelligence Response Team (IRT). The order followed a suit by APC Chairman Ben Nwoye, Legal Adviser Ben Nebe, and Administrative Secretary Evaristus Asadu. They prayed the court to restrain them following calls from operatives of the IGP Response Command asking Nwoye to report himself. Justice K. I. Okpe, after hearing the plaintiffs’ lawyer Ugochukwu Eze, ruled “that an order of interim injunction is hereby granted to the applicants, restraining the respondents, whether by themselves, their agents, men, officers or privies, from arresting, detaining or in any manner restricting the applicants’ rights to personal liberty and freedom of movement pending the hearing and determination of the substantive motion on notice.” He adjourned the matter till May 6. Nwoye said he approached the court for protection as his life was being threatened by Onyeama and his aides. He accused the minister of trying to use his office and the police to breach his fundamental human rights, adding that information reaching him had it that Onyeama was determined to use security operatives to embarrass and disgrace him.
