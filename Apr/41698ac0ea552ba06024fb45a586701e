Two-time unified heavyweight champion, Anthony Joshua, has predicted an outright victory for Tyson Fury in a rematch bout against Deontay Wilder. “I never write off any heavyweight because all it takes is one punch, and I think Wilder believes that himself,” said Joshua when asked if Wilder can beat Fury in their third fight. “’You got to be perfect for 12 rounds. I just got to be perfect for one second.’ Fury produced one of heavyweight boxing’s finest ever performances to destroy Wilder in February and become a world champion once again. Fury dominated their Las Vegas rematch from the first bell, flooring his opponent several times before his corner threw in the towel. The Gypsy King’s win led to calls for him to face off against fellow British superstar Anthony Joshua next. But that bout has been put on the back burner with Wilder invoking his right to have a third clash with Fury. The heavyweight rivals will now complete their blockbuster trilogy later this year but the fight has been put into doubt due to the coronavirus pandemic. Fury is slated to fight Wilder for the third time next after the Bronze Bomber took up his rematch clause. The date and location of the bout has not officially been confirmed yet and was expected to be held at the MGM Grand again on July 18. That has had to be changed due to the ongoing issues surrounding the pandemic and the fight is now reportedly set to take place on October 3 in Las Vegas again.
