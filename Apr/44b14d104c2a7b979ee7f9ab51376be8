 An indigenous social club, Yoruba Tennis Club, on Thursday donated medical equipment to the Lagos State Government, to cushion the effect of the lockdown. The Chairman, Olawunmi Agbaje, handing over the equipment, expressed concern about the well-being of residents, stressing that “this is the best time to show love and care to the people.” Agbaje, an architect, hailed the government for tackling the virus. “We thank God for the proactive attitude of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and his team for setting the ball rolling, even when the virus had not entered the country, hence the reason for the successes recorded in fighting the pandemic,” he said. Agbaje said that the club was motivated to support the government in fighting the pandemic.  “This is why the elders, the management and the entire members supported the government with medical equipment of 1,600 pieces of face masks and 40,000 pieces of hand gloves, which we are sure will be useful for the residents and will assist in curtailing the spread of Coronavirus,” he added. Receiving the equipment on behalf of the government, Transportation Commissioner Dr. Frederick Oladeinde thanked the club for its magnanimity. He said that the government would use the equipment judiciously. Oladeinde advised Lagosians to support the Governor Sanwo-Olu administration in fighting COVID-19 pandemic.
