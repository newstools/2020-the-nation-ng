Gross earnings rose to N61.42 billion in first quarter of the year as against N58.69 billion recorded in first quarter of last year.

Profit before tax improved slightly from N23.51 billion to N24.41 billion. After taxes, net profit increased from N19.15 billion in first quarter 2019 to N20.60 billion in first quarter 2020.

The first quarter performance indicates a modest performance outlook for the group in the current business year. Stanbic IBTC Holdings had recorded a net profit of N75.04 billion in 2019. The board of the holding company subsequently recommended payment of N21 billion as dividend for the 2019 business year, implying a dividend per share of N2, 33.3 per cent increase on N1.50 per share paid for the 2018 business year.
