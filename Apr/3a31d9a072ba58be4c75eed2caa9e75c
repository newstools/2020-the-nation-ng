 The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) on Thursday distributed food items to 200 households as palliatives to cushion the effects of Coronavirus lockdown in its host communities in Bauchi State. The Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, said the distribution of the palliatives was part of the ceremony to mark the 56th anniversary of the force in the country. Abubakar, represented by the Air Officer Commanding Special Operations Command, Bauchi, AVM Charles Ohwoo, distributed the items to the vulnerable in the host communities of Gwallaga and Dorum. “The distribution is done to cushion the effect of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown in the state and across the country. “The Nigerian Air Force is celebrating its 56th anniversary. “This is part of our social responsibility. We reach out to our host communities and give our own contributions to fight the pandemic,” he said According to him, NAF distributed 100 packages of food items at Gwallaga and another 100 at Durum which constitute the host communities of the force in Bauchi. He said each package of the palliatives would feed a family of four for a period of four weeks, expressing hope that the measure would encourage people to stay at home. Abubakar said beyond firing bullets and dropping bombs, “the Nigerian air force are also humans that can assist their fellow human beings.” Responding on behalf of the host communities, the Ward Head of Gwallaga, Alhaji Dandada Ahmadu, described the intervention as timely. “We thank the air force for these palliatives, and we shall utilise them and encourage people to stay at home so that we can reduce the spread of this deadly virus,” Ahmadu said.
