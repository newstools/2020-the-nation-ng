 Lawal Waliyulah, one of the returnees from Cote d’Ivoire quarantined by the Osun State Government, saw his relations who came to visit him at the Ejigbo isolation centre ‘miles away’ and could not talk to them. “We only saw them miles away,” Waliyulah told The Nation after his discharge from the centre. “The security operatives at the isolation centre kept them off. We could not even talk to them because they were kept far away from us,” he said.
