 Prof. Jonah Onuoha, Head of Department of Political Science, University of Nigeria Nsukka (UNN), has said the late Malam Abba Kyari, the former Chief of Staff (CoS), to President Muhammadu Buhari, was a detribalised Nigerian. Onuoha told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Nsukka on Wednesday that Kyari was an intelligent and seasoned administrator, who used his wealth of knowledge to serve his fatherland. “The former CoS was a patriotic and detribalised Nigerian who came, saw and conquered,” he said. The Don, who is also the Director of American Studies in UNN, said it was unfortunate that many people misunderstood the former CoS while alive. He said the former Chief of Staff (CoS) worked round-the-clock to move the country to the next level. “Kyari never joined issues with those who accused him in one thing or the other because he believed they would make him lose focus. “To him when you continue to reply to people who accuse you falsely, you are helping them to achieve cheap popularity and publicity. “The former CoS was one that did not believe in talking too much but in hard work as well as achieving quality results,” he said. Onuoha said that the death of Kyari had robbed the country of seasoned administrator, intelligent politician, a silent achiever and patriotic citizen. “May Almighty God grant his soul eternal rest as well as give his family the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss,” he said (NAN)
