 Nollywood actress Grace Ama has hinted at joining Nigerian politics sometime soon. The ‘Single Lady’ star gave the hint in an exclusive chat with The Nation. “I am still thinking about it because I don’t know if I have the heart for it. But the way I’m looking at it, I think it is the only way that my voice can be heard,” she said.  Ama further said that though joining politics or not won’t stop her from doing the right things, she thinks she has a flair for the terrain. “Though I don’t have to be a politician before I do what is right really but I have flair for it,” she told The Nation. The actress disclosed that she has a fantastic love life and hopes to be married with more kids in the next five years.
