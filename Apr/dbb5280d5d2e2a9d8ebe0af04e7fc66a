Toke Makinwa has released her nude photoshopped picture on social media to escape blackmail. The On-Air personality via Instagram on Tuesday called out the scammer, who is trying to get money out of her. She said: “Is this really how low we’ve become? I understand that things are hard, I get that feeding off each other and scamming people will be on the rise but I’ve never and would never negotiate with con artists/scammers.” She added: “I am sharing this ahead of your threats to release these edited/false images cos this is disappointing, this is not humanity, there is a pandemic killing people and there’s also certain human beings wanting to exploit people in a time when we should all spread love and kindness. “Stop with your bloody emails already I am not the one, not yesterday, not today, not ever. I don’t have any money to give you.” This makes Toke Makinwa the second celebrity in the last month to have experienced similar ordeals in the hands of blackmailers. Veteran singer, Abeni Salawa, was also blackmailed with her past nude photos. https://www.instagram.com/p/B_PHWfQFTIQ/
