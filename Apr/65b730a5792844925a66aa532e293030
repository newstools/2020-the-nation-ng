A 30-year old man on Saturday narrowly escaped death after falling off from the overhead bridge at the popular Upper Iweka in Onitsha, Anambra state. Residents of the area alleged the victim attempted suicide around 3.15pm after jumping down from the flyover following news of total lockdown by the state government. One of them, who preferred anonimity, said he saw the body of the man lying lifeless while driving pass the area. “They said the man just committed suicide by jumping from the Upper Iweka Flyover immediately he had a news of total lockdown by the Anambra state government today,” he said. Reacting, police spokesperson, Haruna Mohammed, dismissed the alleged suicide report, saying the victim was still alive.
