 The police in Kaduna have arraigned two men before a Magistratesâ€™ Court in Kafanchan for alleged theft of mobile phone. David Musa, 27, and Abdullahi Sani, 25, are standing trial on charges of criminal conspiracy and theft, contrary to sections 59 and 270 of the Kaduna State Penal Code Law. The Police Prosecutor, Insp. Johnson Ibudu, had told the court that one Ango Eugene reported the matter at the station on March 21. Ibudu stated that the complainant alleged that unknown persons entered his room at about 10:00 pm on March 20 and made away with his Android phone, valued at N38, 000. He noted that the complainant strongly suspected the two accused persons to have committed the crime. When the charges were read to them, they both pleaded not guilty. The prosecutor thereafter prayed the court for adjournment to enable the police call its witnesses to prove its case. In her ruling, Magistrate Mary Adams, granted the accused persons bail in the sum of N100, 000 each and a surety in like sum. Adams adjourned the matter until April 20, for further mention. (NAN)
