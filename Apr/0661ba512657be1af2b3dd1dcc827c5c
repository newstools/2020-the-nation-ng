 MEDICAL expert has allayed the fears over lack of a vaccine that could end the coronavirus pandemic. Olufunso Seye who is the medical director of St Shiloh Hospital, Sango, Ogun State said he was optimistic that the cure to the deadly disease is in sight, noting that the cure could be found in a number of existing drugs in the country. He said: “Although the use of chloroquine has been suggested to be impactful towards the cure of coronavirus which hasn’t been certified safe by the World Health Organisation (WHO) for consumption yet, but I am convinced that there is a high possibility that the use of other existing drugs along with chloroquine is very likely to yield positive result towards the cure of coronavirus. “No doubt the virus is real and it is spreading fast. As at today, we have more than 170 active cases in Nigeria, according to WHO. “From the evidence so far, the new coronavirus can be transmitted in all areas including areas with hot and humid weather. “The best way is to stay safe by staying at home to break the chain of transmission. “Whether we will overcome the virus or not depends largely on us and our compliance on the preventive tips. He added: “Many people around still don’t believe or rather still think coronavirus is the disease of the rich or of the politicians. This is not true. “We all have to be aware of the fact that the virus does not discriminate, hence, the need to break the chain of transmission. “Most viral illnesses don’t have cure and are usually self-limiting once they run their course. “Till date, no known drug or vaccine has been discovered or approved despite rigorous and unrelenting researches. “The only way out now is to isolate the active cases and then urge everyone to go on self-quarantine.”
