  THE Bank of Industry (BoI) has joined other corporate organisations and philanthropists in supporting the fight against the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic by donating N700million to the relief fund. The bank announced that it has contributed N500million of its relief funding to the private sector Coalition Against COVID-19 (CACOVID). This donation will go towards a fund that has been created to provide more testing, isolation and treatment centres across all geo-political zones. In addition, BoI is providing financial support of N100million to the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Ministerial Committee on COVID-19. The bank is also supporting the Lagos State Government with a donation of N100million.
