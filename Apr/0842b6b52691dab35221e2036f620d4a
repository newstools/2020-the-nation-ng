 Moba and Oye Local Government Councils of Ekiti on Thursday distributed rice to vulnerable persons to cushion the effects of the stay-at-home order aimed at curtailing the spread of coronavirus. The Chairman of Moba Local Government Council, Mr Michael Aborisade, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Otun-Ekiti that the gesture was part of efforts to encourage compliance with the directive. Aborisade reiterated that the local government would continue to work with the state government to ensure that vulnerable persons do not suffer during the lockdown. He, however, appealed to indigenes of Otun-Ekiti to continue to pray against the spread of the deadly virus. Similarly, the Chairman of Oye Local Government Council, Mr Foluso Ojo, said that the rice was targeted at widows and the less privileged in the council. Ojo prayed that God would soon put an end to the spread of COVID-19 in the country.(NAN)
