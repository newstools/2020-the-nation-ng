Amidst the COVID-19 panic in the country, Enugu State Commissioner for Health, Professor Anthony Ugochukwu, has given up the ghost. A statement signed on behalf of the family by Dr. Kingsley C. Ugochukwu, stated that the late commissioner, whose sad event took place on the 3rd of April, 2020, died “after a prolonged but valiant battle with chronic kidney disease”. The statement said late Ugochukwu “was until his death a Consultant Surgeon, Professor of Medicine, serving Commissioner for Health, Enugu State and immediate past Provost of ESUT College of Medicine, Enugu State”. Earlier report said the renowned surgeon died at a leading private hospital, Memphys Hospital, Enugu. The House member representing his constituency, Oji River State Constituency in Enugu House of Assembly, Hon. Jeff Mbah, in his response, described the late surgeon as a genius and technocrat, adding, “He is a great loss to both Enugu State and Nigeria. We are talking about a renowned Professor of Surgeon who has a lot to offer in turning around out health sector. It’s a terrible blow.” He disclosed that the commissioner just came back from the United States and was doing fine before the sudden relapse. Professor Anthony Ugochukwu has been sick from his days as Provost of College of Medicine. He later recovered and concluded his work in the College. However, shortly after he was appointed commissioner last year, the sickness returned, this time more severe.
