The governor said that the curfew would be reviewed after the 10-day period within which government must have increased screening and testing for the COVID-19 pandemic in the state. He said that the decision was to ensure strict compliance with all the measures aimed at curbing the spread of the deadly virus in the state. “Dear Edo people, to ensure strict compliance with measures to curb the spread of #COVID-19, I have given an order prohibiting movement of people in Edo state from 7 pm. to 6 am. “This order will be reviewed after 10 days when we have increased screening and testing,” the governor said in the handle. Obaseki said that the state government’s decision to impose partial lockdown was to ensure that the economy of the state was not totally shutdown. According to him, it is also not meant to expose the people of the state to hardship and fatal incidents that might follow a total lockdown.
