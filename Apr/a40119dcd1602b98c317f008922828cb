To fuel their greatness, I’m excited to announce the #KOBStayHomeChallenge, powered by the nourishing goodness of Malta Guinness.  “To enter, Actors must re-enact any scene from the original King of Boys movie and post on their Instagram page with the hashtags #KOBstayHomeChallenge #KOBXMaltaGuinness#StayHomeStaySafe. This competition is open to everyone, except those with an existing cinema movie credit,” she wrote.
