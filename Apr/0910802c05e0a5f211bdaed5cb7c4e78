The Organised Labour has admitted that there will be a serious job loss and wage cut by many organisation this year as a result of the current crisis. They said this is expected , even after the crisis is over. The growing number of COVID-19 cases, which has led to lockdown, forcing many public and private organisations to scale down their operations, as part of measures to contain the spread, is expected to impact negatively on the profitability of organisations, they said. Speaking with The Nation, the President Trade Union Congress(TUC), Comrade Quadri Olaleye, said this is the battle many of the organisation’s union will face after the crisis. He said the situation would lead to wage cuts as well as layoffs by organisations battling to balance the books and make returns to shareholders. He said as part of the preventive procedure to curb the spread of the virus as well as protect their employees and other critical stakeholders, many private and public organisations have instructed their workers to stay away and some  work from home. Only those on essential services are allowed to go to work. He said this Federal Government is expected to intervene by negotiating  with the employers. He said, for instance, the bail out fund from the government should be made available to the employers.
