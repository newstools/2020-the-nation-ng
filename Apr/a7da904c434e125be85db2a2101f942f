 The father of the Mr. Boris Johnson said that the British Prime Minister would need time to recover before returning to his job at Downing Street despite being moved out of intensive care. The PM was returned to the general ward at St Thomas’ hospital on Thursday night. His dad, Stanley Johnson, told BBC Radio 4 the apparent improvement in the PM’s condition as a relief and admitted that his son almost “took one for the team.” He said there was no prospect of the younger Johnson returning to work soon. Ministers have been speculating it could take weeks before the PM is back in action. The dad said: “To use that American expression, he almost took one for the team. We have got to make sure we play the game properly now. “I think this is all pretty straight forward now, he must rest up, as I understand it… “I don’t think you can say he’s out of the woods now. He has to take time. “I don’t know the details but I cannot believe you can walk away from this and get straight back to Downing Street and pick up the reins without a period of readjustment. But that’s just me talking as a layman.” They called his pregnant fiancée Carrie Symonds moments after being shifted and No10 said he was in ‘good spirits’ despite his battle with the disease. Ms Symonds herself has been isolating in the couple’s Camberwell property.
