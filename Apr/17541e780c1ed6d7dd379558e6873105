 Abia State Government has announced the extension of the ongoing lock down in the state by another seven days. In a release issued Tuesday evening by the Secretary to the State Government (SSG) Barr. Chris Ezem said that the new lock down takes effect from Wednesday, April 8, 2020. “This extension is necessary to confirm that we are indeed free of the virus. “This is because the normal incubation period for the virus is 14 days. “Government is aware of the hardship and inconvenience this situation has brought upon our people. “But it is better to live with temporary inconvenience than to expose ourselves to this disease in search of comfort. “The NCDC is still tracking over 2000 suspected cases across the country. “While these persons are not from Abia, this is a time that calls for extra vigilance. “Within this period, Government will continue to distribute some food items, sanitizers and face masks which commenced officially today. “Government hereby directs all the various enforcement teams at the State and Local Government levels as well as all security agencies to continue the enforcement of the directives on lockdown at the borders, markets, Transport operators, Religious Groups and all forms of public gathering. “Transition Committee Chairmen of Local Government Areas and Security Operatives are directed to remain vigilant. “Government commends all Frontline Service Providers, and all those on essential services including but not limited to medical and paramedical personnel, environmental and community health officers, ASEPA, all volunteers and security agencies who have stood firm with the State Government to battle this virus. “Governor Okezie Ikpeazu is grateful to Ndi Abia for keeping faith and complying with the sit at home directive so far.
