 LOSC Lille reportedly won’t let go Nigeria striker Victor Osimhen in the upcoming transfer window with words rife that the French Ligue 1 side are willing to sell centre-back Gabriel Magalhães to any English Premier League side. Influential French tabloid L’Équipe rated  the  22-year-old Brazilian  ahead of several  other exciting youngsters  in the French Ligue 1i with the likelihood of making a big money move to the EPL. The  duo of   Rennes  midfielder Eduardo Camavinga and Dijon’s Mounir Chouiar were also mentioned but sources  at Lille according to L’Équipe will most likely sell Magalhães rather than Osimhen. “Among names like Chouiar, Camavinga, and Osimhen – players who have experienced extraordinary breakout campaigns in Ligue 1 this year – there is one that seems certain to surface in a different country come next season. “Gabriel dos Santos Magalhães is that name, and after numerous reports linking the 22-year-old defender to Premier League clubs like Everton, Arsenal, and Chelsea, the central defender’s potential departure from Lille feels imminent. Magalhães with less than two full seasons of Ligue 1 under his belt is currently valued at  30m Euros and was recently dubbed a “colossus” with his imposing figure in Lille’s defence. The lad is said to be the architect of the impressive  goal scoring  of Osimhen and company hence  being courted by top EPL sides including Everton, Arsenal and Chelsea. Noted L’Équipe: “As a centre-back for Christophe Galtier’s Lille, Gabriel sees a lot of the ball. On average, the 22-year-old completes the most passes per 90 for Les Dogues and is also the primary passing outlet when the team’s electric attackers try to beat an offside trap or break past opposing defenders.”
