 SOME brides to-be in Lagos  on Wednesday expressed disappointment at the extension of the lockdown of the state by the Federal Government. The president had earlier ordered lockdown of the states for an initial 14 days that started on March 30. The extension began on Monday night. The affected brides-to-be said the extension has thrown them into confusion and has frustrated their plans as they had to cancel or further postpone their wedding ceremonies. Miss Abimbola Ajisafe, a childcare giver, said she had postponed her wedding ceremony when the initial lockdown was imposed on March 30. “I tried to be hopeful that it would be lifted after 14 days, but it did not happened that way. “Having your money tied down indefinitely on wedding plans is no joke,” she said. A lawyer, Miss  Sandra Omeche, also said she had stopped making further wedding plans when she suspected that the lockdown would be  extended. “My wedding date was fixed for May 2;  so I had been calling my vendors to make sure that they still had certain things in place, but the lockdown extension would hinder certain things. “Just yesterday, my parents decided to postpone the wedding ceremony indefinitely,” Omeche said. Another bride-to-be, Miss Simisola Tometi, said her wedding slated for April 18, had been postponed but the lockdown distorted the plan and left her confused. “I must say that this year has been pretty hard on me and my fiance because it was with great difficulty that we got both families to agree to our union. “Just when we thought everything was moving smoothly, the lockdown started. “I still can’t find words to express how I feel, but I pray that God helps me through this trying time. I am really sad,” Tometi said.
