 The alumni of the Adeniran Ogunsanya College of Education, (AOCOED) Oto/Ijanikin, Lagos State, has announced its decision to mass produce facemasks for students, its host communities and residents in Lagos, free. The association said the move was part of its corporate social responsibility (CSR) to support the Lagos State Government’s fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, last week made compulsory the use of facemask from Monday, as part of measures to further contain the pandemic. In a statement made available to CAMPUSLIFE, the body’s National Public Relations Officer, Eniola Opeyemi, said it would  kickstart the initiative which would be executed by some past and present students of the college who took a vocation in fashion designing, under the college’s  entrepreneurship programme.  Eniola said: “Preparations are in top gear to ensure our institution contributes to the fight against COVID-19, and we need to encourage our schools nationwide by asking them to look inward for solutions. “The Secretary of the association, Mr. Ismaila Yusuf, has listed the names of past and present students of AOCOED who have come up with beautiful designs suitable for the purpose. We are set to mobilise them for immediate production of free face masks to Lagosians,” he added. Eniola said 1,000 facemasks would be produced in the first phase of the initiative solely for students of AOCOED as samples, after which the very best among the lot would be selected for further mass production to host communities as well as Lagos residents. Eniola said those  for Lagos residents would be delivered to the Office of the Special Adviser on Education.
