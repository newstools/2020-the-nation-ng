David  ‘Hayemaker’ Haye (28-4, 26 KOs) said the one fight he would entertain the idea of coming out of retirement for would be for him to face the winner of the Anthony Joshua vs. Tyson Fury heavyweight clash. Haye, 39, said  it was  not his intention to come out of retirement at this point in his life. ‘The Hayemaker’ hasn’t fought in two years since losing to Tony Bellew by a fifth-round knockout in their rematch in May 2018. That performance by the injury-wracked Haye showed that he had very little left at that stage of his 16-year pro career. With that said, Haye would entertain the idea of facing the Joshua-Fury winner of it were presented to him. The money alone that Haye would receive in facing Joshua or Fury would make it worth the time and risk investment. However, for Haye to have a shot at being offered the fight against the winner of that match-up, he would need to come out of retirement and get one or two solid victories under his belt. Haye isn’t in the class as a superstar like Mike Tyson or Evander Holyfield, and be able to get offered a huge fight after being out of the ring for ages. “The only one that I would do it for is the winner of AJ and Tyson Fury because that would be #1 vs. #1,” said Haye to Behind The Gloves when asked who he would come out of retirement to face.”
