The Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) on Saturday cautioned the Federal Government over the decision of to bring  Chinese Medical doctors to assist Nigeria to fight Coronavirus. According to NUJ, the Nigerian doctors are doing ‘exceptionally well’ in fighting the outbreak. Bringing the Chinese doctors, the union said, will be counter-productive. The union in a statement issued by the President Chris Isiguzo and Secretary Shuaibu Leman. “While some  have applauded the way and manner China contained the virus in Wuhan- the only Chinese city to be so affected, we hasten to note that there is more to this charade than is being let out by the Chinese authorities, and we  reject a situation where Nigeria will be used as a Guinea pig for any experiment. ” It is pertinent to plead with the Federal Government to  stop this Medical team from coming to Nigeria because of  the Italian example where there was an inexplicable spike in Covid 19 related deaths when the Chinese doctors arrived the country, ” the union said. It called on the government to as a matter of urgency investigate the allegation that “what is happening today is associated with the launching of the 5G communication network,as Nigerians are becoming more agitated over the issue which cannot be swept under the carpet. “We urge the Federal Government to be more proactive in dealing with these emerging issues because any mistake made will be catastrophic.”
