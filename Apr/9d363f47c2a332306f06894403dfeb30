 Singer Dotman has joined an upwardly mobile entertainment outfit, Labo Entertainment in a bid to reposition himself on the music scene. The ‘Akube’ singer aligned with the label – a subsidiary of Labo Group – to help develop and promote his talent to a global audience. Dotman joins a list of Nigerian entertainers, who had previously worked with the record label before their exit. Owned by creative entrepreneur Olabisi Akanbi, Labo Entertainment has been home to Konga, Sideone, Ecoman, and Smapee. Speaking on why he signed on Dotman, Akanbi said, “With the benefit of my long term experience in the game, I am excited that we will make a big impact this time around. That’s what I want to achieve with the young and talented singer, Dotman. He has a hunger to go global and that’s something we both share in common.”
