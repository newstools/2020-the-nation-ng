 The Nigerian Textiles Manufacturers Association (NTMA) has urged state governments interested in procuring face masks for their citizens to consider using the garments and tailoring section of the association for its work for safe, secure, and hygienically-produced face masks. Its President, Mr. Folorunso Daniya, said it was better to use trusted factories of its members rather than compound the health situation by using local tailors operating shops of questionable health backgrounds. According to Daniya, while the government is working on solving a problem, it would not be proper to exacerbate it. At present, the Lagos State government is engaging tailors to produce face masks. This is against the use of well-established garment factories with capacity to meet the nation’s needs.  He added that there are well regulated companies which have in place proper hygiene procedure and their production is standardised, all the association is asking  for is governments at all levels to engage NTMA which is the umbrella body for textile and garments manufacturers in the country. The president said written submissions have been made through the Manufacturing Association of Nigeria (MAN), adding that no reply has been given. In addition, the government at all levels should ensure the materials used are from local factories. Daniya said it would be disappointing if, at the end of the day, the country resorts to importation, instead of encouraging and empowering local producers.
