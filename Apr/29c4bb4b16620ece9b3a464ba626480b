 The Premier League has suspended the 2019/20 season indefinitely amid the coronavirus pandemic and the UKâ€™s lockdown, but remains intent on completing the full campaign. No Premier League matches have been played since 9 March, and the majority of top-flight teams still have nine games to play to finish their 38-game season. But with no clear end in sight for the coronavirus pandemic, the League confirmed that it will not return to action in May as had been tentatively scheduled, with no estimation given for when it may return. The League stressed an intention to complete the season, with clubs in agreement that voiding the entire season was not an acceptable resolution.
