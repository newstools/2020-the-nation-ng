 The Kwara Government has dismissed claims across the state suggesting that a local delicacy of yam flour, popularly called ‘Amala’, cures Coronavirus (COVID-19). Dr Abubakar Ayinla, the Permanent Secretary, state Ministry of Health, dismissed the claims on Tuesday in Ilorin during the daily routine meetings of the Medical Team of the Kwara COVID-19 Technical Committee in the state. Ayinla said that the state government has set up the Risk Communication teams, among others, to manage rumours and fake news circulating as regards COVID-19 in the state. He explained that the Risk Communication teams were set up to allay fears of misconception, while reiterating that COVID-19 has no cure for now and that amala cannot cure it. Ayinla said that the confirmed patients with COVID-19 at the Sobi Isolation Centre were faring well, adding that the state government is caring for their necessary needs. Also speaking, Dr Michael Oguntoye, the Director Primary Health Care at the Ministry of Health, explained that the state presently has three COVID-19 isolation centres across the state. According to him, the Sobi Isolation Centre currently has 300 bed space for different levels of care as well as the intensive care unit together with high risk unit. He noted that the whole of the Sobi hospital has been converted to an Isolation centre. The other Isolation centres, he said, included the Hajj Transit Camp which has been turned to an Isolation centre and establishment of another Isolation camp at Offa. Oguntoye also said the state had acquired additional two ventilators to cater for any eventuality. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that currently the state has four confirmed cases of COVID-19, as issued by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). (NAN)
