The Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 seasons are to be cancelled after French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced that no sporting events, even those behind closed doors, could take place before September. Officials had been hoping teams could resume training within a fortnight after plans emerged earlier this month for the league to resume on June 17 and conclude on July 25. But the French top flight will now follow the Dutch Eredivisie as a second major European league season is abandoned due to the coronavirus pandemic. Most teams in Ligue 1 have ten games left to play this season, while Paris St Germain and Strasbourg have 11. According to reports, the Ligue de Football Professionel (LFP) will meet next month to make final decisions over how to finalise the standings given that not all teams have played the same number of games. PSG lead the standings by 11 points from Marseille, with one point separating Rennes in third, which comes with a Champions League qualifying berth, from Lille in fourth place and a Europa League spot. Amiens and Toulouse are in the bottom two, while Nimes sit 18th, a position which would ordinarily put them in a relegation play-off against a club from Ligue 2.
