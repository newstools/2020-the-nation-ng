 Ondo State Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has denied sponsoring the crisis rocking the Unity Forum of the All Progressives Congress (APC). He said he is more focused on delivering good governance to the people and preparing for the primary election rather than dissipating energy trying to create problems in the Unity Forum. Members of the Unity Forum headed by Alhaji Ali Olaniyi had vowed to unseat Akeredolu, but crisis reared its head in the group last month when some of its foot soldiers accused the leadership of collecting money from a particular aspirant. About 12 members in the group have declared interest to run for the Ondo governorship race. Governor Akeredolu said there was no way any of his proxies would be sponsoring crisis in the Unity Forum without his knowledge.
