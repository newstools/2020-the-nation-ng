President Muhammadu Buhari is urging prayers by Nigerians for the country to pull through the Coronavirus pandemic. Buhari in his Easter message on Friday said bad as the situation is  Nigerians should   remain faithful and hopeful that  ”with intensified prayers backed by personal and collective responsibility, the nation shall pull through this most difficult trial.” His words: “This year’s commemoration of Easter comes amid the grip with which Covid-19 has held the entire world. “Unprecedented in living memory, majority of Christians have found themselves marking Easter in a subdued manner, away from the usual congregation in churches. This is unusual and very unfortunate.” He  enjoined  Christians to “rekindle their faith in Christ who overcame persecution, sufferings and displayed endurance, steadfastness and above all piety.” Jesus Christ,according to him “represented man’s ability to withstand temporary pains in the hope of everlasting glory,” and asked His followers to “imbibe and live the values of humility, discipline, perseverance, sacrifice and obedience which Jesus Christ demonstrated during His stay on earth.” He added: “As I stated in my national broadcast on Sunday, March 29, 2020, since there is currently no known vaccine against the virus, ‘the best and most efficient way to avoid getting infected is through regular hygiene and sanitary practices as well as social distancing.’ “I am very much aware of the personal and collective inconveniences suffered by our people due to measures such as restriction of movements and closure of business premises. Being ‘a matter of life and death,’ these sacrifices are in everybody’s interest to save our country from calamity. “The welfare of our people is paramount. Accordingly, the most economically vulnerable in our communities will continue to be uppermost in our plans, and efforts will be made to supply them with basic means of survival.”
