 BARCELONA head coach Quique Setien says he is aiming to win the UEFA Champions League and La Liga titles during his time at Camp Nou – and dreams of taking both trophies back to his home town to show off to the local wildlife. The former Real Betis manager was appointed Barca boss earlier this season following the dismissal of Ernesto Valverde, although he was not the first choice, with former club captain Xavi turning down the job before Setien was appointed. The 61-year-old boss is optimistic, however, and has set his sights on winning the biggest prizes available to the club – and then going back to his home as a champion. Setien told TV3: “I have told the players many times that I don’t have time to lose, and I’d like to win both the Champions League and La Liga. “Of course I’ve dreamed of winning these titles, and having a walk in Liencres [his hometown] among the cows with the Champions League and La Liga trophies in my hands.”
