The kidnapped Edo Commissioner for Science and Technology, Emmanuel Agbale is alive despite Friday evening’s killing of his police orderly. Our reporter learnt last night the criminals eventually contacted members of the victim’s family and they were allowed to speak with him. The family source was however silent on the demanded ransom. Edo Police spokesman, Chidi Nwabuzor, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), assured that with the deployments and efforts being made by the command, the commissioner would soon regain his freedom unhurt. The law lecturer at Edo State government-owned Ambrose Alli University, Ekpoma was kidnapped at Ogbemudia Farm on Benin-Auchi Road, on his way to Ekpoma. Agbale’s injured driver later informed the police of the kidnap of his boss and killing of his police orderly, making the Edo police command to immediately deploy men to be combing the forest.
