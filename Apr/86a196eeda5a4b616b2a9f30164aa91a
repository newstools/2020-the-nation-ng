Africa’s number one badminton player  Anuoluwapo Opeyori has expressed optimism that the Coronavirus pandemic  will not halt his ambition of playing at the Tokyo Olympic Games next year. Ranked 52 (MD) in the world along with his Men’s Double  partner Godwin Olofua, Opeyori  said they were already tipped to be at the games before the spread of the virus. “We are already on the list and  it was just for the Badminton World Federation (BWF) to close the qualification portal and announce those that have made it but due to COVID-19, everything was suspended and the time-frame for qualification extended,” Opeyori said in an interview with NationSport. “What I read in the BWF newsletter is that those that are within qualification, the world body will organise favourable events for them so as not to lose their spots and enable them berth in Tokyo. “We are still waiting for the BWF to make their final decision but eventually we will still go for some qualifiers after the pandemic and that is what I can say for now,” added the Nigeria’s top player. Opeyori revealed that he had some catching up to do if he hopes to play in the singles event in Tokyo which would have some of the best players in attendance: “I was actually trying to catch up and amass more point before the pandemic. If I could go to some other tournaments, there is possibility of qualifying for the singles. “After winning the African Games, I also did well at the Kenya Challenge, I was thinking that those performances would boost my games and I can amass more points and move up in the ranking. But we have to restart after the defeat of COVID-19,” noted Opeyori who is ranked 109 in the world.
