 CHAIRMAN, Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters, Senator Opeyemi Bamidele, has donated N10 million to Ekiti State. The senator’s donation  followed Governor Kayode Fayemi’s eight-man Support Account Committee inauguration. Bamidele, who represents Ekiti Central Senatorial District, said: “The donation is my way of identifying with the state government and the people in combating the pandemic. “This patriotic zeal is an additional step after all the 109 senators had resolved to donate half of our monthly salaries to the national COVID-19 Account.” Bamidele said he had directed that N5 million should be given to the state’s COVID-19 committee, while another N5 million be given to the centrally coordinated COVID-19 food initiative in the state. He also called on well-meaning indigenes of the state to complement ongoing efforts of the Fayemi’s administration to curtail the spread of the pandemic.
