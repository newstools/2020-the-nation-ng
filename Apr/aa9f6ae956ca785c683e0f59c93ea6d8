An amended 10 count charges have been filed against a lecturer in the Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba-Akoko and a Clergyman, Pastor John Abiodun, over allegation of planting of baby placenta on the altar of Promised Land Prophetic Ministries located along Akure-Owo expressway, Akure. The two men were earlier arraigned on five count charges of conspiracy, publication of false news, aiding publication of false news and aiding impersonation at an Ondo state High Court sitting in Akure. Authorities of the church had insisted that the allegation was false and an attempt to tarnish the image of the church. The two defendants were alleged to have conspired together to publish life threatening, rumours, false and inciting stories about one Ajidahun Emmanuel Jeminiyi and Pastor Gbenga Akinbiyi on various social media platforms including Divine Revelation and Christ Apostolic Church Youth WhatsApp platforms. Prosecuting Counsel for the state, Kayode Dare filed the amended charges before Justice Bode Adegbehinge and it was not opposed by Defence Counsel, Emmanuel Emodamori and Adelanke Akinrata. In the amended charges, nine witnesses were listed to be called by the prosecution. Jeminiyi who was first called to give evidence presented Whatsapp messages, serial calls, and social media posts and SMS from the two defendants to prove the allegations. Justice Adegbehingbe adjourned further hearing of the case to May 14th after one of the Counsels informed the court of an attack on a lawyer in River State and there was need for urgent assistance to be rendered. The Prosecution team is expected to call the other eight witnesses at the next adjourned date.
