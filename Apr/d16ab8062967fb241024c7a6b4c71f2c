One of the four suspects arraigned for killing Mrs. Funke Olakunrin, the daughter of Afenifere leader, Pa Reuben Fasoranti, has tested positive for COVID-19. The four suspects were arraigned last Friday and remanded at a correctional facility in Owo. Ondo State Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, who confirmed this in a tweet yesterday morning, said that the state had confirmed three new COVID-19 cases. He said Police Commissioner Undie Adie had been informed, adding that line tracing of police officers and others in the SARS facility where the suspected killer was kept had begun, while their specimens were collected. The governor said: “The suspect has been isolated and will be moved to the IDH for treatment. The police commissioner has assured the state that there will be adequate security around the IDH premises to prevent escape. While on treatment, he will be manacled to the bed. “I will expatiate on all cases in my weekly press briefing tomorrow.”
