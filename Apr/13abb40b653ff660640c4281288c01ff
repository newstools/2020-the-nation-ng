 ABIA State government has said it had traced 262 persons that had contacts with the two COVID-19 index cases in the state. Information Commissioner John Okiyi Kalu announced this on Wednesday in a statement in Umuahia, the state capital. Okiyi said the government was actively following 221 persons. The commissioner explained that the sample of a police officer from Bayelsa State, who died at the Abia State University Teaching Hospital in Aba, among other 31 high-risk samples so far taken and tested from contacts of the index cases, returned negative. He said Governor Okezie Ikpeazu had approved the deployment of doctors on the payroll of the state government to work with other health personnel on the index patients, two units of patient monitors, one oxygen concentrator and medications on the two index patients admitted in their isolation centre. According to him, the state is collaborating with Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to train relevant medical personnel to handle COVID-19 cases. “Our index cases, both of who were patients of Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Umuahia, are stable and receiving care at the isolation facility of the hospital. We are optimistic that even as geriatric patients, who are above 70 years old and with underlying medical conditions, God will use the firm and experienced hands of our medics to bring them back to good health,” Kalu  said.
