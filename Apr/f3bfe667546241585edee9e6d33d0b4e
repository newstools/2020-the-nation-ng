Enugu State Government has announced the closure of popular Ogbete Main Market in Enugu metropolis following health concerns. A statement on Wednesday by the Commissioner for Information, Mr Chidi Aroh, said the decision to shut the market was a fallout of Gov. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi’s visit to the area. Aroh said the governor had gone to the market with heads of security agencies to ascertain compliance with government’s order closing markets and borders. “Following the non-compliance by traders and the urgent need to start the fumigation of the market, the state government ordered the immediate closure of the market, including adjoining sections and Akwata,” Aroh said.
