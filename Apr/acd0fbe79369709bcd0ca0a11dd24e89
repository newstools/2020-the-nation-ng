A middle-aged man suspected to be a COVID-19 patient has been apprehended while attempting to sneak through the Anambra boundary on foot after returning from Lagos State. The man was intercepted by Commissioner for Transport, Dr Christian Madubuko at Amansea, a border town between Anambra and Enugu while addressing Task Force on the need to ensure that the boundary remains closed. Anambra Government had classified Lagos as a high risk for the pandemic, urging residents to alert its officials of any returnee from the state. Madubuko, who confronted the man while walking through the road barricades at the boundary, told newsmen that he would only release him on the condition that he was certified free from the virus. He said: “This man here came in from Lagos, defying all the inter-state boundaries but we just caught him. “I have notified the Commissioner for Health about this man and he is on his way here. We will only release him if the Commissioner for Health examines him and certifies him free, else, we may have to quarantine him for 14 days.” Reacting, the man who said he was a truck driver, denied having any illness. “I am a truck driver. I am from Anambra State. I am just coming to the state to drop some money for my mother, after parking my truck in our company in Anambra. “I am not sick besides I was checked with infrared in most of the borders while I was coming from Lagos. I was also made to wash and sanitise my hands at all the borders, while I was coming from Lagos.”
