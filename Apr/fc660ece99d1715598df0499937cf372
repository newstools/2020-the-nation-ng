Facebook is expanding its Coronavirus Information Centre to 17 more countries in sub-Saharan Africa, including Nigeria. The centres form part of Facebook’s effort to help the global fight against COVID-19 by providing people with the latest news and information from trusted health authorities as well as resources and tips to stay healthy and support their family and community. The centre is featured at the top of News Feed that provides a central place for people to keep informed about the Coronavirus. It includes real-time updates from national health authorities and global organisations such as the World Health Organisation (WHO), as well as helpful articles, videos and posts about social distancing and preventing the spread of COVID-19. Facebook users can opt in to follow the centre to get notifications and see updates in their News Feed from official government health authorities. The centre has been launched in South Africa, and will be expanded to Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, Gabon, Guinea, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Senegal and Seychelles. Others are The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Togo.
