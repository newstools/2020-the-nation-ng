Nigerian Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (NIEEE) has debunked any link between the fifth generation (5G) technology and the ravaging COVID-19 pandemic. According to the group, while the spread of COVID-19 was a threat to life and global economy, the 5G technology had potential to accelerate global industrial and environmental advancement without health implications. NIEEâ€™s National Chairman Kings Adeyemi said the 5G mobile network had the potential to digitally transform industries, such as health care, energy, finance services, transportation, entertainment, manufacturing and so on.
