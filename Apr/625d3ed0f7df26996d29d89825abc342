Nollywood actress Adunni Ade has damned critics on social media to identify herself as a practicing Muslim. Adunni Ade used the opportunity to caution trolls to stop judging celebrities based on their dressing but their inner intentions. According to the mother of two, her religious belief is that God will judge everyone by his/her intentions only. “Yes, I wear what I like, be it modest or not. Who are you to decide my inner intentions? You know, it’s easy for you to type on your keypads and make assumptions, but folks who know me will say otherwise.” The actress revealed that four years ago, she returned to Islam after practicing Christianity for many years “About 4 years ago, Dec 31st, 2016, I decided I would live my life for ME. Me alone! I came back to Islam. I feel fulfilled. I’m happier. I have received more Blessings this way. My oldest son practices Islam prays and fasts as well.” On why she converted to Muslim, the Nigerian-American actress said, “I have a loving Muslim father who has given his children the free will to choose any religion they like be it Christianity or Islam. My Mom is a Christian, though not a practicing one. My Stepmom is a Christian, My stepsisters are Christians, my Stepbrothers are Muslims. “Have I been to a Church before? Plentyyyyy of them. I once converted, name the Church, MFM, RCCG, CLAM, CAC sure been there but one thing was certain, Islam never left me. My ways of dealing, my upbringing, all I learned was from a Muslim and was what I truly knew. I was scared what folks would think about me if I went back to Islam and this went on for years.” The actress also revealed her Muslim as Zainab.
