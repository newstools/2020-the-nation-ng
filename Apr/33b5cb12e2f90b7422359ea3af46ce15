By Precious Igbonwelundu  About 100 suspected Boko Haram Terrorists (BHTs) were on Thursday killed around the Lake Chad Basin and cache of arms recovered by Chadian troops in an operation led by President Idris Debby. The operation condemned Wrath of Boma was launched by President Debby following the murder of about 92 Chadian soldiers by the terrorists in a recent ambush. It was gathered that the operation was named after the town where BHTs killed the Chadian soldiers in an ambush that lasted over seven hours. According to video footage and information from the operation available on the internet, Debby who said he would not accept defeat from the terrorists, led his armed forces to battle at Kelkoua bank and Magumeri where they fired rockets and 12.5mm rounds ammunition on the criminals. The troops were said to have also destroyed several BHTs bunkers, recovered cache of arms and arrested a top BHT commander. At Magumeri, a local government in the northern Borno State, the Chadian troops were alleged to have set free some Nigerian soldiers held captive by terrorists. According to reports, the Chadian troops have dealt the terrorists massive blow and have advanced into neighbouring countries with a vow to destroy them completely in few days.
