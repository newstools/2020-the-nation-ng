The Kwara branch of the Shoprite has introduced ‘no face masks, no entry’ system to its customers if they must come to shop in the mall. A correspondent of the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) visited the Palms Mall, Fate Road, Ilorin, which housed the Shoprite on Wednesday. The correspondent observed that the management of the mall had provided hand sanitizers at its main gate for its potential customers and visitors to rub their hands before they were allowed into the mall. When NAN correspondent approached the entrance of the shop, he was asked to go back because he was not wearing a mask. The correspondent was then directed to a nearby pharmaceutical shop inside the Mall to buy a face mask that he wore before entering. NAN reports that the pharmaceutical made brisk business as shoppers besieged the place to get face masks before they could enter the mall. (NAN)
