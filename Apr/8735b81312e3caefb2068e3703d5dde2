 Super Eagles defender, Leon Balogun has described his recall to the national team setup as special. The 31-year-old has missed out on the national team due to lack of playing time at Premier League side, Brighton and Hove Albions. However, the former Mainz 05 defender has enjoyed more game time since moving to Championship side, Wigan on loan in January . He was subsequently named in Genort Rohr 24- man list to face Sierra Leone last month for the AFCON 2021 qualifier but the match had to be postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. In interview with Tolu Olasoji monitored on YouTube by our correspondent, Balogun said he was looking forward to join the Super Eagles team. “It’s not a big difference to the general situation because we are just not allowed to play football.  “Obviously, it’s special because I haven’t been with the Super Eagles for the last three matches simply because I was not playing at all, I didn’t make the matchday squad at Brighton. “So, it was sad because I was looking forward to being back home in Nigeria again for some time. Enjoy good vibe, different vibe, nice weather, happy people like the group that the team is. “I can’t even say ‘we were’ because not much has changed, just some few additions to the team. It’s always fun and it’s just a different vibe and I was looking forward to it but I mean, it’s not that it’s never going to happen again, it’s just postponed,” he said.
