The Musical Copyright Society Nigeria, MCSN has attacked the Copyright Society of Nigeria for disbursing the sum of N50 million to its members. In a statement by the chairman of MCSN, Oritz Williki, the disbursement of the fund which is aimed at helping members cushion the effect of COVID-19 has been tagged illegal. The MCSN also stressed that the operations of COSON have been declared illegal by a law court, hence, the need to stop acting and disbursing funds. MCSN further described the move as a grand plan to deflate and loot assets that may have been acquired in the name of COSON. “It has come to the notice of the Musical Copyright Society Nigeria Ltd/Gte (MCSN) the announcement made by Chief Tony Okoroji of his decision on the behest of the extinct company, Copyright Society of Nigeria Limited by Guarantee (COSON), to share the sum of Fifty Million Naira (N50,000,000.00) to musicians on its register to cushion the effect of the COVID-19 Lockdown on them. “Ordinarily, this would have been a very laudable and commendable gesture but for a company which a court of competent jurisdiction has declared illegal and with other pending actions bothering on accountability hanging on the defunct company and its managers; the intention and action smell of serious illegitimacy and criminality. “MCSN sees this as nothing short of a grand plan to deflate and loot whatever assets that may have been acquired in the name of the extinct company, COSON,” the statement read in part. The MCSN and COSON have been at loggerheads over the collection of copyright works of Nigerian musicians, who are members under it. Each of the collective management organisations has claimed to be the legal organisation saddled with the collection of royalties on behalf of the music acts.
