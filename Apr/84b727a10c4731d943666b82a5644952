As the rainy season approaches, I would like to re-iterate some vital points to enhance safety on  the roads. Drivers must remind themselves of the factors that affect friction (lack of friction leads to skidding and road crashes). There are several deep potholes on the roads which drivers can misconstrue. Always drive slowly on such roads. Research has revealed that there are usually more crashes and other road traffic problems during the raining season than the dry season. This is the reason why I am using this media to sound a very loud warning to all categories of drivers and vehicle owners that “Drivers Beware”. While we are appealing to all levels of government to repair the bad roads and construct more essential roads, “Drivers beware. A stitch in time saves mine”.
