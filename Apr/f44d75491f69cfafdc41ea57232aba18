 A NIGERIAN, Benjamin Goong, has expressed concern over the relaxation of restrictions for Easter celebrations. He urged the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) to consider public health concerns. Goong recalled that South Korea experienced COVID-19 outbreak after an infected individual went to church. He said: “I am worried about CAN taking permission from the Federal government to hold Easter celebrations in churches. The question I am asking is that; will coronavirus understand that CAN took permission from the Federal Government before doing its celebrations? “One sneeze from a victim during such ceremonies will afflict hundreds of people, and then, contact tracing will become the responsibility of government and not CAN. “Leaders of CAN must stop this madness. They can only worship God if they are alive. They must also realise that luring others to the church to go and die by Coronavirus in the name of any ceremony is a crime before God.”
