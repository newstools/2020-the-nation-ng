A lecturer of law, Wahab Shittu, has described the late Chief Richard Akinjide (SAN) as an extraordinarily brilliant lawyer who knew the country inside out. Shittu, a lecturer in the Faculty of Law, University of Lagos (UNILAG), Akoka, said this yesterday in a tribute. He said: “Easily one of the very best legal brains Nigeria has ever produced. Truly exceptional, endowed and extraordinarily brilliant, Chief Akinjide is a lawyer’s lawyer. “A good example of the truism that a lawyer really has no business with poverty. Chief  Richard Akinjide owned choice houses in privileged estates in the United kingdom. “An Administrator per excellence, the departed legal icon knew Nigeria inside out. Father of 12 2/3 in Nigeria’s legal jurisprudence; the history of Nigeria’s legal landscape cannot be complete without a generous mention of his venerable name. “He was a politician, administrator, statesman and a gentleman. He ranked amongst the ranks of legal giants of his era and indeed Nigeria’s history. He was in the same league with FRA Williams (SAN); Kehinde Sofola (SAN); GOK Ajayi (SAN); Chief Gani Fawehinmi (SAN); Chief Frank Akinrele (SAN); and others. “Adieu, Chief Richard Akinjide, a lawyer- statesman, fiery politician, administrator and a gentleman.”
