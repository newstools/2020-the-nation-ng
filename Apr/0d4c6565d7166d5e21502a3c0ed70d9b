 The Lagos State Fire Service (LSFS) has averted another fire outbreak from a 45,000 litres petrol-laden articulated vehicle along Lagos State University (LASU), Igando Express Way, Village Bus Stop, Lagos. The Acting Head of LSFS, Mrs Margaret Adeseye, who disclosed this on Friday in Lagos, said the service received an emergency call earlier in the day at 7 a.m. She said that the firefighters from Ojo Fire Station were promptly deployed to the scene. “On arrival at the scene, the firefighters discovered fuel leakage on a 45,000 litres fully laden Mazda tanker, with registration number AAA 198 XZ. “The tanker was conveying Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) from Apapa to Agbara. The firefighters, however, neutralised the potency of the content and averted another potential fire outbreak,” she said. Adeseye said that in spite of the lockdown, a good number of fire related emergencies had been successfully managed. Adeseye urged Lagos residents to always stay safe and report fire outbreaks on time. (NAN)
