He said: “The nefarious gang was on rampage on the street at about 7pm yesterday (Friday). My friend’s dad stumbled and fell to the ground due to old age and before he could stand up, he was caught and killed. “He was rushed to the hospital at Funto Hospital, along Ijesha Road but he gave up the ghost early this morning (Saturday) due to the multiple machete cuts all over his body and head. “One Million Boys’ nefarious activity is real in case anyone is still in doubt.” Findings by our correspondent revealed that there were clashes between area boys in Aguda, Ijesha and Itire occasioned by long standing rivalries.
