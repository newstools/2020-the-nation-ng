 OVER 10 pastors have been arrested by police from the Eket divisional headquarters in Akwa Ibom State for holding church services against the stay-at-home directive of the state government. Governor Udom Emmanuel had on Thursday ordered a total lock down across the state, following the announcement by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC)  that five persons had tested positive to the coronavirus in the state. In defiance of the  directive, some churches in Eket opened on Sunday as members gathered in their numbers for services. The Eket branch pastor of the Deeper Life Bible Church and a pastor of the United African Evangelical Church were among those arrested Sunday morning by the police.
