Sanusi Mu’azu Danmusa, Comptroller of Corrections, Kaduna State Command, has described as malicious reports by a section of the media on the true story behind the attempted jail-break at the Nigeria Correctional Service Kaduna State Command. In a statement on Saturday, Danmusa said there was an attempted jail-break by a section of the condemned convict cell in the custodial centre on March 31, 2020. The Controller, who acknowledged that the Command has since cleared the air on the incident, decided to make further clarifications to dispel rumours making the rounds about attempts by the Command to hide the truth from the public. The statement which partly reads said, “This release is necessary to assure the public that the Command and indeed the Service are not trying to hide any fact as purported by a section of the Press, especially when life is involved. Four inmates later died in the hospital from the injuries sustained in the melee that ensued while being restrained by the Custodial officers from breaking jail. For the avoidance of doubt, all the deceased inmates were from the condemned section of the Custodial Centre where the jail-break occurred. “A comprehensive investigation has commenced on the directive of the Controller General of the Nigeria Correctional Service, Alhaji Jafaru Ahmed,” he added.
