The National Insurance Commission (NAICOM), has issued regulatory forebearance for the period of the movement restrictions by the government to curb and manage the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The regulatory forebearance, according to the Commission, will as much as possible ensure the availability of insurance services and protections of insurance policyholders during the COVID-19 movement restriction. In a statement yesterday in Abuja, the Commission said: “Where Approval-In- Principle for the preceding insurance period had been granted, all renewals or extensions of the foreign reinsurance proportions that become due during COVID-19 movement restriction are permitted for renewal on existing basis. “Where Approval-In-Principle for the foreign proportion of a new insurance placement is required during the COVID-19 movement restriction, it shall be treated on the basis of “Use and File” subject to prior exhaustion of in-country capacity. “For the avoidance of doubt, after utilizing available local capacity, the lead insurer is permitted to reinsure the excess of the risk offshore and submit relevant documentations to the Commission thereafter. “All Post Placement Reports, Reinsurance Treaties and other related special risk foreign reinsurance documentations due for submission during the pendency of the COVID-19 restrictions are to be submitted when movement restrictions are lifted”. NAICOM stressed that all insurance/reinsurance placements shall he done in accordance with other relevant extant insurance laws, regulations and guidelines while all submissions to the Commission including hard-copies sequel to the above forbearance shall be done not later seven (7) days from the end of COVlD-19 movement restrictions.
