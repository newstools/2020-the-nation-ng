The Coronavirus pandemic has ended the crisis between the Federal Polytechnic Oko, Anambra State, and its host community. This happened at the weekend when the Rector, Dr Francisca Nwafulugo, led the management to the monarch, Prof. Laz Ekwueme, to present palliatives to the community. Sanitisers and face masks, manufactured internally by the polytechnic were donated. Nwafulugo, who spoke through the Deputy Rector, Dr Izuchukwu Onu, urged Nigerians to adhere to preventive measures against the virus. The monarch said the rector had shown good leadership, adding that more was needed to cement the relationship. Ekwueme, who noted that the cat-and-dog relationship between the community and institution was over, thanked the rector and management for remembering the community. He said:  “We appreciate this gesture from the polytechnic. I am glad that the institution is now insisting on quality which we have been clamouring for. Providing these protective materials to the community is a sign of good relationship between the polytechnic and the host community. The era of cat-and-dog relationship is over. “Community service, excellence, quality education, and good public relations are what we expected. I am impressed by the rector’s leadership style, but more is needed to cement the relationship further. This kind of gesture promotes peace and unity between institutions and their host communities. “
