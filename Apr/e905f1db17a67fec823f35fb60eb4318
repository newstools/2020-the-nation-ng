In Manta community in Shiroro local government area, five people were killed and five others injured while in Madaka community in Rafi local government area, one person was killed with many others injured. Sources in Shiroro local government council said the attack in Manta was carried out by bandits who rode into the community on motorcycles and started shooting sporadically into the air. The displaced people are currently taking refuge at a temporary IDP camp in Bosso Primary School in Minna. Local vigilantes, who were on the trail of the bandits, had to abandon and run for their lives when they discovered a helicopter in the air. According to the vigilantes, they ran away because they suspected the helicopter was in support of the bandits. They alleged they did not know where the helicopter came from or who was in it. “We beat a retreat when we saw the helicopter because we were afraid that they may mistake us for the bandits and bomb us,” one of them stated.
