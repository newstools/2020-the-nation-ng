Spanish lawmakers voted Thursday evening to extend state of emergency measures until April 26, as the battles against the coronavirus outbreak rage on. The measures prolong the state of emergency for the second time in Spain, which has the world’s second-highest coronavirus death toll. Several economic and labour regulations have been introduced to help bring the crisis under control. The outbreak has led to a near-collapse of Spain’s health system as the country reported more than 15,000 deaths by yesterday although the daily rate of infection is beginning to slow down. Spanish citizens will now be under compulsory lockdown for a total of six weeks. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez warned that he might need to ask for a third extension to prolong measures until next month.
