 CRC Credit Bureau is making lending easier for financial institutions that have automated their lending applications via an Application Programme Interface (API). In a statement, the firm said with CRC’s API, lenders can continue to enjoy loan grants and postpaid services via an automated process by accessing CRC’s robust database of over 33 million credit profiles, as one of the criteria needed for decision making. With the current restriction of movement instated by the Federal Government, prospective borrowers are no longer able to physically visit their banks and other lending institutions to apply for loans to take care of their personal needs or finance their businesses.
