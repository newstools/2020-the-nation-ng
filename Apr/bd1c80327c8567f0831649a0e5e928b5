 More commercial tricycle (Keke) riders have received palliatives and safety kits from Simba Group, distributors of TVS tricycles. The company has been donating food items, face masks and hand sanitisers to Keke riders across the country. The programme, which began at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, has enabled thousands of riders to operate safely, where there is no lockdown. Simba Group officials held restricted-access handover ceremonies, in line with suggested social distancing practices, to donate the items in collaboration with state governments. Such handover ceremonies took place in Maiduguri, the Borno State capital, Kano, Sokoto and Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, with more scheduled to take place across the country, local restrictions permitting.  The company’s Group Managing Director Vinay Grover said: “The COVID-19 pandemic has had a massive impact on our lives, and there is no doubt that there will be far-reaching consequences for us as a society. “Our top priority at the moment is the health and safety of our employees, our customers and those in our wider community. “Recognising that riders of motorcycles and tricycles are daily wage earners and often have the primary financial responsibilities for their families, Simba is running a nationwide campaign to sensitise them on health and safety and has made donations towards personal protective equipment and food supplies for them. “We endeavour to continue doing this wherever possible in the country.”
