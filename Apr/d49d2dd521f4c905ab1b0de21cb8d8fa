CRISTIANO Ronaldo has been warned that he has “no privilege” when it comes to coronavirus lockdown rules, with the Juventus superstar having been spotted training at Madeira’s national stadium. The five-time Ballon d’Or winner returned to his homeland prior to the Covid-19 pandemic shutting down football around the world. He has remained in his native Portugal after seeing his mother suffer a health scare and Juve grant permission for a number of senior stars to remain away from Turin. His regime has seen him get out of the house and make use of CD Nacional’s home ground in Funchal.  The former Manchester United and Real Madrid forward was far from the only person in attendance when being put through his paces and Madeira’s regional secretary of health, Pedro Ramos, has urged a global superstar to set a good example for others when it comes to social distancing. He told reporters: “Ronaldo has no special permission to train. “Cristiano Ronaldo has the right to train as long as he respects the rules like all citizens, there is no privilege. “All citizens can leave the house and do so, as long as they do not cause gatherings and maintain a safe distance during the exercise. Therefore, Ronaldo did what we have seen.
