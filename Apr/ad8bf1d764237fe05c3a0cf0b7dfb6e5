Gbade Ogunwale, Abuja  The Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) has assured that its member will comply with the new pump price of petrol as directed by the federal government. The government had, on Tuesday, announced further cut in domestic pump price of petrol from N125 to N123.50. The new price cut is coming three weeks after the government slashed the initial price from N145 down to N125. In a statement by IPMAN President, Sanusi Fari, the association also pledged that members would work in sync with the leadership of the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) and Petroleum Tanker Drivers (PTD) to mitigate the pain occasioned by the sit-at-home order of the federal government. Fari said despite the new price cut, petroleum marketers would continue to ensure that petrol filling stations across the country remain open to serve the public. The association however appealed to the Petroleum Equalization Fund (PEF) to sustain payments to petroleum product marketers, to ensure availability of products across the country. Fari said, “We have directed our members to continue operation in line with the directives of Mr. President by ensuring that our petrol stations remain open while observing the strict guidelines from our health authorities. “We, like other Nigerians, are calling on our members to sacrifice by obeying the directives of Mr. President. “We call on the Petroleum Equalization Fund management board to continue payment of marketers’ bridging claims as promised, to lessen our burden, especially at this time to enable us continue to serve the public in the interest of our country, Nigeria”. The association expressed optimism in the ability of the federal government to tame the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. IPMAN also thanked the Nigerian Association of Road Transport Owners (NARTO), NUPENG and PTD for their cooperation in forging a common front in the collective fight against the COVID-19 crisis.
