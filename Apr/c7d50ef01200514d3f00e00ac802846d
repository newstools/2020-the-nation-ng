 The Taraba State Primary Healthcare Development Agency, on Monday in Jalingo, flagged off a statewide sensitisation campaign against the spread of COVID-19. Mr Victor Bala, the Chairman of the board of the agency, said that although the state had not recorded any case of the Coronavirus pandemic, it was necessary for the agency to take proactive measures. “Prevention is better than cure. As we can see Coronavirus is real and is globally claiming lives at an alarming rate. “Today we are here to officially begin the distribution of commodities to all local government areas that will help in the preventive process in our healthcare facilities and communities. “You are all aware that up till now, Taraba state has not recorded any case of COVID-19. “This is partly due to the commitment of the state government that has put in place several measures directed at safeguarding the lives of Taraba people,” Bala said. Earlier, the Executive Secretary of the agency, Alhaji Aminu Hassan, said the exercise would be championed by Directors of the Primary Healthcare Departments in the 16 local government areas of the state. He told the directors that they were the eyes and ears of the state government at the rural areas, and urged them to be up and doing in their service to humanity. “Coronavirus is real. Wash your hands and stay at home. Maintain social distance. Just as a mask is better than ventilator, your home is better than intensive care unit,” he warned. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that items such as hand sanitiser, face masks, soap, wash basins and buckets were distributed to the representatives of the local government areas. The directors pledged to sensitise the various communities in the local government areas on the need to stay safe. (NAN)
