Should Anthony Enahoro rise from the grave in gratitude to the Buhari government, or go to court as a ghost to charge the government for pardoning him with impunity? It is a rare act of unsolicited generosity. If anything, maybe we can take the pardon as an act of goodwill to one of our sages of nationalism, who fought as Zikist, and was a jailbird three times. At independence, he was with Awolowo, the number one avatar of our history, in what was known as treasonable felony. Gowon forgave him and others, including Awo, and became minister of information for almost decade before Murtala edged out Gowon. So although he was investigated over some funds in FESTAC and was charged over his pro-democratic onslaughts, he was never indicted. How do you forgive me when I did not commit a crime? It is a puzzle that the Attorney general must clear. Or was he pardoned for being Enahoro, which would be an original sin? Then it would not be him alone but all others like Awo and Jakande. The Enahoro family saw it as a sort of accolade, but a pardon is not sought but by a sinner. In our history, Enahoro was more sinned against than sinning by the state from Colonial times to the military era. Let his only pardon rest in peace.
