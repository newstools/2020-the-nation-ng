 The Conference 57, an umbrella body for all Chairmen of 57 Local Governments and Local Councils Development Areas (LCDAs) in Lagos State, has said the lockdown is critical to the country’s survival. In a statement by its Public Relations Officer Olusesan Daini, the group called on Lagosians to fully cooperate with the government in eradicating the Coronavirus by obeying the stay-at-home order.

The group said: “We call on residents to see the fight against the virus as a matter of life and death, believing strongly that the only way to defeat the pandemic is when we fight collectively and resolutely.  “Residents should cooperate with and help the government by reporting suspected and/or identified cases in their neighbourhood through the designated contact numbers approved by the State Ministry of Health.” The group said the defeat of Coronavirus in Lagos would be a major victory to the nation at this point in time and beyond. It Lagosians not to avoid panic bur abide by the government’s restriction order which is the only way to win. “We commend Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu-led Lagos State Government for the swift response and proactive measures put in place so far at containing the dreaded virus. “We call on the Federal Government to take lessons from the present situation to speed up approval of much agitated Special Status for Lagos State beyond political reasoning to enable the state deal with issues bordering on population and social pressures from time to time,” the group said.
