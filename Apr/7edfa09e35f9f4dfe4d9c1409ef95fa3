 A HUGE fire broke out at Dugbe Market, Ibadan yesterday razing two buildings housing over eight shops. The fire, which started at about 1:25 pm, affected a story building and a bungalow which houses several shops. The Chief Fire Officer of the Oyo State Fire Service Mr Moshood Adewuyi told The Nation that the service received a distress call around 1:30 pm, adding that a vehicle was sent there immediately to put out the fire. On getting there, the firemen realized the enormity of the fire and called for a second vehicle. The combination of the efforts of the teams and two vehicles helped put out the fire at about 3:00pm. But the shops were badly affected, leading to huge loss for the affected traders. Only the ground floor of the story building was spared. The floor is used as a warehouse for building materials. Adewuyi said the cause of the fire was yet to be determined as at press time. The razed shops are located opposite UBA building at Dugbe Alawo area of the capital city.
