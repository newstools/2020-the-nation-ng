The Nigeria Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA), Ekiti state chapter, has distributed relief materials to 500 widows to cushioned the effect of the lockdown caused by the spread of Coronavirus in the state. The Council urged all Muslims to comply with the directives of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) aiming at curbing the pandemic. While distributing the palliatives in Ado Ekiti, the state capital, NSCIA Ekiti state chapter Chairman, Alhaji Yakubu Oladoro Sanni said the 500 beneficiaries were the most vulnerable widows drawn from the 16 local governments in the state. He noted that the apex body of the NSCIA had earlier commenced distribution of palliatives in Abuja. “In a bid to reach the most vulnerable Muslims, the council has identified the widows as the most critical vulnerable members of the community and should be the set of people to benefit from this gesture,” he said. Sanni said despite the hardship being experienced by the people, there was need to adhere to the lockdown directives. He said: “The government that is giving the order is not doing it because of itself, it is in our own interest to obey the order and end the COVID-19 pandemic in the country.  So, we enjoin all Muslims to abide by the do’s and don’t s of COVID-19 as advised by NSCIA President-General, Alhaji Muhammad Sa’ad Abubakar during the Ramadan period.”
