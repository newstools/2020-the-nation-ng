 THE UEFA Champions League and Europa League could be abandoned if coronavirus restrictions remain in place into September, according to UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin. But Ceferin added that playing behind closed doors would be preferred to abandoning games. Champions League and Europa League matches are currently suspended until further notice. “We can’t play it out in September or October,” Ceferin told ZDF Sportstudio. When asked whether the season could be abandoned, he added: “If the authorities do not allow us to play, then we cannot play.” Premier League clubs Manchester City and Chelsea are both still in the Champions League, while Manchester United, Wolves and Scottish Premiership side Rangers are all in the Europa League.
