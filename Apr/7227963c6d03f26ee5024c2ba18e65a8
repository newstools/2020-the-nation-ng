  Nigeria’s hair extension brand, Darling has set up a relief fund to help alleviate some of the economic toll the pandemic has taken on small hairstyling businesses. The relief fund catered to five hundred hairstylists, to assist with the purchase of basic amenities. Head of Marketing, Godrej West Africa, Ayodele Otujinrin disclosed this in an interview. According to Otujinrin, the purpose of the donation was to provide much-needed support for members of the hairstyling community who have been put out of work during this unprecedented time. In addition, Darling has pledged to continue supporting a select number of these small scale stylists and salon owners after the pandemic by supplying Darling hair products to several salons and stylists at no cost to help them restart their businesses. Darling, the manager said was not only supporting its immediate community; the brand is also honoring those on the frontlines of the pandemic. As the number of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria increases, the firm said more health workers remain at work to help contain the spread of the virus. To appreciate health workers for their sacrifices and commendable work in fighting the spread of coronavirus, Darling has kicked off a campaign online tagged ‘Darling Health Workers Salute.’ To further drive the ‘Darling Health Worker Salute’ campaign, Darling is working with the Lagos State Government to provide complimentary meals for health workers at the Infectious Disease Hospital, Yaba, for a period of two weeks.
