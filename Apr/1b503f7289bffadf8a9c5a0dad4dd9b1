The Christian Association of Nigeria(CAN) in Ondo State has ordered Christians to stay away from churches on Easter Day. Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu had earlier granted permission to the churches to hold services on Easter day provided they followed laid down procedures. But the discovery of a COVID-19 patient in the state on Friday made the state government reconsider its decision. A statement by the Ondo Chairman of CAN, Rev. Ayo Oladapo, urged all Christians in the state to hold Easter services at home. According to the statement: “In view of the present situations with the second index case of COVID-19 in the state, and in due consultation with all stakeholders. We have resolved to cancel the Easter Sunday Service.”
