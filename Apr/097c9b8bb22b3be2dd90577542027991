 Following the new conditions given to the Super Eagles Technical Adviser Gernot Rohr to retain his job by the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), the German tactician has said he will not comment on the issue for now until after consultation. Rohr, who is currently in France, said commenting or reacting to the issue would be unnecessary but at the right time he would make his decision known to his employers. “I have no comment for now. I will make my stand known in due course. I know my contract runs out in June 20. I enjoy working in Nigeria and we have maintained good working relationship.  Nigeria is a good country with young talented players and the players are fantastic. With or without me, the players can stand the test of time in any competition and I have confidence in them. A contract is an agreement between two parties. For now, no comment, “Rohr said. On Monday, the President of the NFF, Amaju Pinnick said Rohr would retain his job if he accepts the conditions by having his salary paid in Naira and not Dollars, ready to live in Nigeria and to monitor and nurture domestic players.
