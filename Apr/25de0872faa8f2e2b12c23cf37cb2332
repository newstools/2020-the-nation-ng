 Veteran musician Queen Salawa Abeni, has expressed gratitude to fans for their unwavering support over an attempt to blackmail her on social media. Salawa gave her gratitude while reacting to story via ” Your View” on Friday in Lagos. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that a young man named Jason had sent Salawa’s semi-nude pictures via her WhatsApp demanding a ransom as a condition to backpedal from posting the picture. NAN also reports that the scammer had threatened to tarnish her image and destroyed her career of over 45 years with the nude pictures. Salawa said she was still in shock over the overwhelming show of support she enjoyed from Nigerians, after raising the alarm about the young man’s planned blackmail. The 58-year-old Nigerian singer said she was compelled to release her nude pictures on Instagram to avoid being blackmailed by Jason from Osun state. Salawa, however, took to her Instagram page to share screenshots of her chats and the said nude pictures to beat the blackmailer to it. “I released my nude photos in order to beat my blackmailer, one Jason hands down. She said that the pictures were probably taken when she was with her partner or when she was in the hospital, saying, “I am almost 60 now, so nothing to hide, nobody can blackmail me.” Salawa said Nigerians home and abroad bombarded her phone to support hero the nude picture saga, adding that she was not aware she still enjoyed such magnitude of love among Nigerians.(NAN)
