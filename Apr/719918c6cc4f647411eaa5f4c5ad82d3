Aladalah midfielder John Ogu says an eagerness to return into action months of inactivity was the main reason for not signing for the Saudi Professional League club. Ogu was without a club for six months after he left Israel side Hapoel Beer Sheva where he won a number of laurels, including three league titles, one Israeli Cup, and two Super Cup trophies. The versatile midfielder secured a move to Al-Adalah in January signing an initial six-month contract with the option of extending the deal after satisfactory performances. He received criticism as a number of people claimed his move was due to money but the 32-year-old says his readiness to get his career back on track was the sole reason for moving to Saudi Arabia.  “It wasn’t really about money, I just wanted to get back on the field after going idle for six months,” he said in an Instagram live session on Brila FM. “It wasn’t where I was looking at to go play football but when the offer came, I just had to go for it as it was an opportunity for me to relaunch my career and get my mojo back.” Ogu’s career started back at Nigeria’s Flying Sports. He later moved on to places like Slovenia, Portugal, and Spain though it was never in any of the premier clubs or divisions at those countries.
