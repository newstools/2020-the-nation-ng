 Stakeholders at the Journalists International Forum Migration (JIFORM) has urged African leaders to initiate financial bonds to fight Coronavirus. The summit, with the theme ‘Migration and Containment of COVID-19’ held online in Lagos at the weekend. A statement by President and Executive Director of JIFORM Ajibola Abayomi, with the over 150 journalists covering migration across the globe, said the bonds were part of the resolutions taken at the summit. Ajibola said if the initiative were considered, it would provide financial leverage, especially to the poor nations, to contain the virus.  The statement reads: “We want African leaders, to initiate the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) bond and the African Union (AU) bond so that many nations can access funds. This is no time for rhetorics; this risk is high and everyone is a likely victim. “We also say that sensitisation on movements in COVID-19 vulnerable countries and locally is also very key. This is a trying time for the global community, no one free from the threat, we are all vulnerable as human beings. Journalists are not isolated, it is a common enemy that can be eliminated by time, resources, expertise and full adherence to international best practices.”
