 The number of COVID-19 cases have risen to eight in Ondo State. A week ago, the state had only two active cases at the Infectious Disease Hospital. It was gathered one of the cases was from Abuja, who was denied access to her apartment by the landlord. The landlord was said to have alerted the State Government who picked her up. Her samples were collected and the result returned positive. Other persons that tested positive beside the lady from Abuja were two policemen serving in Lagos State, one of the suspected killers of Funke Olufunke and a lady admitted at the Federal Medical Centre, Owo. Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, who disclosed the figures at a press briefing on Monday, described the action of the two policemen as clear evidence of panic, disobedience, lack of discretion and reckless disregard for the well being of others. He said the journey of the two policemen to and fro Lagos and Akure even after receiving their positive status was unnecessary, ill-advised and a total disregard for the national regulation, which forbids interstate movement. Akeredolu stated that he has directed the activation of a wider processes to trace, isolate and test all primary and secondary contacts with all the cases at large in the state to curtail a further spread of the infection. He lamented that the state borders were still porous and heavily compromised by security agents. He accused the security agents of being accomplices by abusing the trust placed on them at this critical time. Urging Ondo residents to choose life by obeying government orders, Akeredolu said the increase in the number of cases showed what would happen if they failed to obey simple rules and regulations carefully crafted to save and preserve lives.
