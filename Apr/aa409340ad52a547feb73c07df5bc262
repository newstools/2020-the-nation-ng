Ondo State Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu on Tuesday imposed an indefinite 7pm to 7am curfew in the state to check the spread of the deadly COVID-19. Akeredolu announced the imposition at the Government House, in Akure. A third positive case was confirmed by the state government on Monday. According to the governor, the third case was not a member of the NYSC as earlier believed, “but an employee of the Nigerian Army Barracks, who served the nation as a medical doctor in the same facility three years ago and was retained.” The governor further explained that the third positive case came in contact with the index case, an army officer, while treating him as a suspected case in the clinic. The governor also said reports showed that business owners, especially beer parlours, had disobeyed the stay-at-home order hence warranting the curfew. “There is the need for effective measure of containment, investigation, enforcement and control, and government will not shy away from its duty to ensure same. “To this end, I have directed further sterner measures to enforce compliance to these regulations,” he said. Apart from the imposition of the curfew, the governor also ordered the arrest and detention of individuals found to have breached government’s directives on restriction of movement of persons and goods. Also to be arrested, he said, were those caught operating business premises and community markets as well as those at religious gatherings and public bars or engaged in other social activities within the state.
