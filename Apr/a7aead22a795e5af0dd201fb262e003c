The central medical store of the malaria control unit, Birin-Kebbi was on Thursday night gutted by fire. A large consignment of drugs was salvaged from the inferno. The fire raged for about four hours before it was put off by combined efforts of sympathisers, including Kebbi Governor Abubakar Atiku Bagudu; the Chief of Staff Government House, Alhaji Suleiman Muhammad Argungu and Secretary to the State Government Alhaji Babale Umar Yauri.
