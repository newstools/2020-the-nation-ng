 THE Ebonyi and Enugu State Governments on Monday unveiled plans for all commercial motorcycle drivers operating in their respective states. In Ebonyi, the State Government said it would provide foodstuffs to registered commercial motorcyclists to cushion the effect of the ban on their operation in the state. The state government last Saturday, banned all forms of motorcycle riding because ‘okada’ riders convey people into the state through illegal routes with the closure of its boundaries. Mr Uchenna Orji, the state’s Commissioner for Information and Orientation in a statement yesterday however directed all ‘Okada’ unions across the 13 Local Government Areas (LGAs) of the state to compile the lists of their members with evidence of registration and payment of fees, for onward submission to government. In Enugu, the government directed all tricycle operators to operate only between 6am and 7pm daily. A statement by the Secretary to the State Government, Prof Simon Uchenna Ortuanya, stated that the decision was in furtherance of the state government’s efforts to sustain its robust response to contain the spread of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in the state, as well as provide maximum security for residents. The state government added that “the earlier Executive Order issued by the Governor, that every ‘Keke’ should carry a maximum of two passengers at a time remains in force.” The statement maintained that “any Keke operator found in contravention of the above directive shall be apprehended by the security agencies and dealt with according to the law.” Meanwhile Association of Bikers in Nigeria (BIN) has warned its members across the country against violating measures put in place by their various states to check the spread of the Coronavirus pandemic. The National President of BIN and Leader of the Hard Riders Bikers Club, Port Harcourt, River State, Nubel Bariza, appealed to members to shun any form of biking fiesta pending the containment of Coronavirus.
