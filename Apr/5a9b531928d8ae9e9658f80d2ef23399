 The Board of Directors of UAC of Nigeria (UACN) Plc has recommended payment of a dividend per share of 10 kobo to shareholders as cash dividend for the 2019 business year. Negative sentiment greeted the dividend recommendation at the stock market. The dividend recommendation was part of the highlights of the audited report and accounts of the conglomerate for the year ended December 31, 2019 released yesterday at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE). Key extracts of the 12-month report showed that turnover rose from N70.47 billion in 2018 to N79.20 billion in 2019. Profit before tax increased from N6.08 billion to N7.46 billion. The group’s profit from continuing operations increased from N4.24 billion in 2018 to N5.35 billion in 2019. However, loss from discontinued operation rose from N13.77 billion in 2018 to N14.60 billion in 2019. With this, loss for the period stood at N9.26 billion in 2019, albeit an improvement on N9.53 billion posted in 2018. Last July 4, the board of UACN had approved that a proposed scheme be effected by the transfer of the ordinary shares held by the group in UACN Property Development Company (UPDC) Plc to the shareholders in proportion to their respective shareholding as reflected in the register of members and on such terms and conditions as the board deems fit.  In line with IFRS 5, UPDC was subsequently classified as disposal group held for distribution to owners. Also, members of UNICO PFA had at an extra-ordinary general meeting approved voluntary winding up of company on February 6, last year. The company is thus in liquidation. Hence, UNICO PFA was classified as a disposal group held for distribution to owners. Last July, UACN had also entered into an agreement to sell eight per cent of its shareholding in MDS to Imperial Capital Limited (ICL). Consequent to the sale, UACN will own 43 per cent of MDS, thereby ceding control. As at end of last year, the transaction was yet to be concluded, hence MDS was classified under IFRS 5 as non-current asset held for disposal and distribution and discontinued operation. Nigeria’s oldest surviving business, UACN started business in Nigeria in 1879, well ahead of the 1914 amalgamation that created the nation. With 10 subsidiaries in key sectors of the Nigerian economy, the UACN Group consists of active companies spreading through manufacturing, services, logistics and real estate sectors. These include four quoted subsidiaries-CAP Plc, UACN Property Development Company (UPDC) Plc, Livestock Feeds and Portland Paints and Products Nigeria Plc; in addition to the parent company, UACN, which was listed in 1974. UPDC Real Estate Investment Trust, which is also quoted on the NSE, is a subsidiary of UPDC. UACN acquired Livestock Feeds and Portland Paints in 2013. Other members of the group included UAC Foods Limited, UAC Restaurants Limited, MDS Logistics Plc, Warm Spring Waters Nigeria Limited, Grand Cereals Limited, and Unico CPFA Limited.
