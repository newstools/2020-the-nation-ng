National Universities Commission (NUC) has approved the accreditation of 14 full and five interim academic programmes for Federal University, Oye-Ekiti (FUOYE),, Ekiti State. This was announced in a letter sent to the Vice Chancellor Prof Kayode Soremekun, and signed by NUC Director of Accreditation Dr Maryam Sali. According to Sali, these programmes were accredited under various faculties that are  running in the institution with a status of interim or full. The new programmes include: Banking and Finance, Public Administration, History and International Studies, Linguistics, Business Education, Education (Agric Science), and Education (Biology). Others include: Education (Chemistry), Education (English), Education (Management), Geology, Mass Communication, Political Science and Peace and Conflict Resolution. However, the likes of Accounting, Business Administration, Education Mathematics, Library and Information Science and Criminology and Security Studies, were granted interim status. Sali said courses with full accreditation are valid for five years, while others on interim status are for two years after which the programmes would be reappraised. She further said programmes that still earn interim status after two visits would be reverted to ‘denied accreditation’ status. The letter stated in part: ‘’In line with its provision and that of the current government following approved procedures, the accreditation of a new academic programme takes place after such programme has run for two sessions following when such programme was established after which approval of such programmes takes place as and when due.’’ Due to this effect, NUC accredited certain academic programmes in the institution last October/November.
