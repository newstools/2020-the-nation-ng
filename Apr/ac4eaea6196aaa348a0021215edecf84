 NOLLYWOOD actress Toyin Abraham has taken sides with the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, to enlighten fans over the growing cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria. Few days after Lagos announced a new isolation center on Landmark beach, Abraham defended the NCDC when a fan noted that there are no cases as been peddled by the government agency. The mother of one had posted an update of new cases of the coronavirus in Nigeria on her page but the follower insisted that the whole news is fake while requesting that the government share pictures of patients at isolation centers. The Instagram follower replied to the ‘Fate of Alakada’ star saying, “One question: Can they show us the isolation centers for all these cases? Yeye people, yeye government all because of money that they want to eat. #audio #coronavirus”. Replying to the follower, Abraham replied, “Do you read news or watch news at all? Stop talking like this please haba. They just opened another one at Landmark today sef. Otisumi”. The actress recently shut down rumors of replacing Funke Akindele as NCDC ambassador after featuring in a TV campaign for the agency. Abraham is one of the actresses, whose film release has been put on hold as a result of the lockdown in Lagos and Abuja.
