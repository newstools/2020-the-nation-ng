 MANY suspected bandits have been killed in an aerial bombardment operation undertaken by the Nigerian military at Maguga, Rafi Local Government Area (LGA) of Niger State, the Defence Headquarters said yesterday. The suspected armed bandits were neutralised by air component of Operation Gama Aiki, a joint military taskforce inaugurated to support ongoing Operation Thunder Strile in that region. The Nation reports that Niger State has been ravaged by kidnappings, terrorism and armed banditry for several months which have disturbed farming activities in most communities. According to the Coordinator, Defence Media Operations, Maj.-Gen. John Enenche, the air operation was conducted on April 19 following reports that some armed bandits, clad in black attire, were sighted with a large herd of rustled cattle in the area. “Accordingly, the Air Component scrambled its aircraft to attack the location. Upon sighting the approaching attack aircraft, the armed bandits scampered to conceal themselves under nearby shrubs but were engaged with cannon fire which led to the neutralisation of several of them. “The Armed Forces of Nigeria wishes to thank all Nigerians for their support and encourages the public to continue providing useful information that would facilitate its operations to restore peace and security to all affected parts of the country.”
