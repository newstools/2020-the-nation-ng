A farmer in Ogun State, Mr. Kolese Womiloju, 45, and his son, Taiwo Womiloju, 25, have been arrested by police  for hacking a herder Abubakar Sidi Usman, 32, to death. Father and son were said to have first attacked the herdsman with a ring laced with charm on April 22 which immobilised him and while he remained unconscious, an then inflicted machete cuts on him, killing him. The suspects dragged the remains of the herdsman to an abandoned well near the scene of attack and dumped them there. It was learnt that the farmer and son had earlier warned the herdsman to pull his herds of cattle out of their area and desist from further grazing on their land but the victim allegedly failed to heed to the warning.

Police spokesman Abimbola Oyeyemi, who made this known on Sunday in a release, said the suspects were arrested by operatives from the Odeda Divisional Police Headquarters.
