A clinically-tested ventilator that can work without electricity has been presented to the management of the University of Benin (UNIBEN) in Edo State, led by the Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Lilian Salami. The ventilator was produced by a team of researchers in the Faculties of Engineering and Medical Sciences of the federal university. The invention, according to UNIBEN’s Spokesperson, Dr. Benedicta Ehanire, was in response to the vice-chancellor’s challenge to various experts in the higher institution to continue to strive to make relevant marks, in order to place the university among the best and on a world-class pedestal. Leader of the team, Prof. Kessington Obahiagbon, disclosed that the group, known as COVID-19 Initiative, took into consideration the peculiar circumstances of the country, especially with the pandemic and irregular supply of electricity. Obahiagbon revealed that the ventilator was produced to work without electricity for at least one hour, while also designed to function in a dual mode for adults and children. An elated vice-chancellor hailed the team for the feat, particularly for looking inward, in efforts to seek solutions to the Coronavirus Disease.
