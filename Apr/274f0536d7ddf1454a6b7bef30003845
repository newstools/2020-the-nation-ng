The essence of the farmersâ€™ market in the various local government areas across Lagos State is to bring food and other essential necessities to people within their neighbourhood at normal prices and ensure people adhere to the lockdown and social distancing. This was disclosed by the state Commissioner for Wealth Creation and Employment, Yetunde Arobieke, Friday during her visit to one of such markets at Emmanuel Nursery and Primary School, Ogudu, Kosofe LGA. Addressing the media, Arobieke said operators of the markets are people and organisations who already have relationship with the state Ministry of Agriculture and are trusted not to take advantage of the situation. Chairman, Kosofe Local Government Area, Afolabi Sofola, advised people to maintain social distancing while patronising the markets. On palliatives, Sofola said widows within his local government have been benefiting from free foodstuff even before the lockdown. Meanwhile, the chairman, yesterday, supervised the disbursement of the Lagos State Government palliatives to wards and CDAs for onward distribution to the people. It was done at the Emmanuel Nursery and Primary School, Ogudu.
