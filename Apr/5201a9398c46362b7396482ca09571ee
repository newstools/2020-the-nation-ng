Innocent Tuface Idibia, popularly known as 2Baba, will on April 12 hold an e-concert in a bid to rally support and unify Nigerians against the spread of the COVID-19 virus in Nigeria. The e-concert, to be live streamed on Tuface’s social media handles (@official2baba) and that of Trophy Extra Special Stout (@trophystout), a brand of International Breweries Plc, will create an extra special moment for people to be entertained with the live performances from the African Queen crooner while they stay at home this period. In addition, Trophy Extra Special Stout together with 2Baba will make a N10m donation to support initiatives combating COVID-19. Bamise Oyegbami, Trophy’s Marketing Manager, said “we have decided to support Tuface in this quest because as a brand, we acknowledge the importance of this initiative; hence we are fully behind it”. During the e-concert, viewers will have the opportunity to engage and interact with 2Baba online and also stand a chance of winning freebies which can be helpful to people whose livelihood may have been impacted by the stay at home situation.
