Rosabon Financial Services, a non-bank financial services firm,  has extended its brokerage programme to  brokers across the nation. The move, it said, is to  provide opportunities for Nigerians to earn extra cash  during the COVID-19 pandemic. With the lockdown to curtail the spread of COVID-19, most firms directed their employees to work from home. Launched in 2016, the Rosabon Brokerage programme enables clients to get loans, leases, investments and partnership packages; while those working for them partime to get deals get a commission of two per cent for their referrals once the deal is sealed. Managing Director of Rosabon Financial Services, Chukwuma Ochonogor, said: “Over the years, we have evolved into one of Nigeria’s leading providers of highly affordable and custom made credit and treasury products to suit the diverse needs of individuals and corporate organisations.  “The idea is to encourage individuals to take advantage of this sit-at-home phase by simply connecting their friends and contacts interested in our credit and investment offerings with our team of qualified experts. They can also earn exclusive rewards when they refer friends and family to connect with our offerings. “In particular, we are creating tailored lifestyle solutions to every individual and doing everything we can to support households and businesses.” Business Consultant, Isiekwu Benjamin added: “Through the Rosabon Brokerage programme, I have gained a wealth of experience. I understand the dynamics of what it required to get loans approved and why some loan requests are declined. The Rosabon Brokerage Programme guarantees me financial rewards in form of my commission for successful referrals.”
