A mobile court sitting at the Eagle Square in Abuja on Sunday convicted five clerics – three Imams and two pastors – for breaching the government’s lockdown order to curtail the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. They were convicted by Presiding Magistrate Idayat Akonni to one month imprisonment. Akonni gave them an option of a fine of N5,000 in addition to a supervised community service for one day. The convicts are: Imam Abdullahi Mohammed of Gwarinpa Estate; Imam Suleiman Idris of Mobi Close, Area 11, Garki and Deputy Imam Useni Umar of the same addresses. Others are: Pastor Phillips Olumbori of Celestial Church of Christ, Lugbe and Rev. Moses Chinedu of Mercy City Gospel Centre, Aco Estate, Lugbe. Addressing reporters after the court verdict, the Chairman FCT Ministerial Enforcement Task Team on COVID-19 Operations, Ikharo Attah, said the various mobile courts, which sat at different locations within the territory, convicted over 73 violators. On the judgment, he said: “The verdict, though mild, is a welcome development. Those sentenced should be worried because they are now ex-convicts having been found guilty and sentenced by a competent court of law. “Why has it become very difficult for custodians and enforcers of divine laws to obey national laws that do not prohibit or infringe on their freedom of religion?”
