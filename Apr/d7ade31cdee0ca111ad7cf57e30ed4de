Stanbic IBTC Holdings Plc, a member of Standard Bank Group, has joined other corporate organisations to offer support to the Federal Government of Nigeria in the fight against the outbreak of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) in Nigeria. The foremost end-to-end financial services institution has donated the sum of N250 million to the Nigerian Private Sector Coalition Against COVID-19, formed recently to combat the virus. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), in partnership with the Nigerian private sector, had formed this alliance to combat the COVID-19. Other individuals and corporate organisations have shown their support towards assisting the government and the country at large to fight the pandemic. Stanbic IBTC Bank PLC, a subsidiary of Stanbic IBTC Holdings PLC, made the donation to support the government’s effort and boost the  health sector’s capacity to combat the pandemic. Stanbic IBTC Bank is also a member of the Operations Committee of the Nigerian Private Sector Coalition Against COVID-19. The Operations Committee is responsible for project management, logistics, communication, and advocacy. Chief Executive, Stanbic IBTC Holdings PLC CEO Yinka Sanni, said: “The rate at which the COVID-19 virus is spreading calls for quick action and collective response to avert unprecedented health, social and economic crises. This is not the battle which the government can fight alone. Both public and private sector stakeholders need to muster every available resource to combat the COVID-19 spread. “Stanbic IBTC remains committed to this cause and will continue to support the government and our compatriots in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.” The Stanbic IBTC Holdings CEO further added that this donation is only one of several interventions being made by the leading end-to-end financial solutions provider as Nigeria battles the COVID-19 pandemic.
