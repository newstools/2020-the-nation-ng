 POLICE in Ebonyi State have arrested a 75 years old woman for alleged severe flogging and pouring of hot pepper into the eye and private part of her 11 years old house help. The woman who gave her name as Comfort Obi was dragged to Ekumenyi Police station Abakaliki by her neighbour who could no longer tolerate the level of abuse being meted out to the child. The body of the child was lacerated as a result of repeated flogging. The 11 year old girl whose first name is Chidinma said her auntie took her from her father’s house in Ohaji Egbema Imo State twelve months ago and brought her to the house of Madam Comfort Obi at number sixty five Gunning Road Abakaliki. Investigations reveal that Chidinma came to live with the suspect following the death of her mother and challenging eye impairment by her father who also fends for her four siblings. The 11 years old girl told this Reporter that her Madam usually invites touts to flog her whenever she commits offence and poured pepper into her private part because she was hungry and took her biscuit and juice. A Neighbour who reported the matter to the police, Mr Osita Ezechukwu alleged that the suspect had been cautioned repeatedly to desist from torturing the girl noting that apart from flogging, the elderly woman also subjected the girl to hard labour. The woman said though she regretted her actions, she sought the permission of the girl’s auntie before she poured pepper into her private part. Police Spokesman in Ebonyi State, Loveth Odah confirmed the incident. She said the suspect has been placed on bail while the child has been treated in the hospital and reunited with her family members. She added that the suspect will be arraigned after the fight against COVID-19.
