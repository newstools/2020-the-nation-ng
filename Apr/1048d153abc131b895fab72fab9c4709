Kano State Government has debunked a post on the social media of an additional seven new cases of COVID-19 in the state. The Nation reports that a clone announcement page of the state Ministry of Health yesterday, was faked and with the state now having 10 positive corona virus cases. The state Commissioner for Health, Dr. Aminu Ibrahim Tsanyawa in a telephone chat, described the report as false. According to him, â€œthe ministry did not post such information on its twitter handle nor issue any release to that effect.
