James Azania, Lokoja  Kogi State Governor, Alhaji Yahaya Bello, on Tuesday, approved the appointment of Prof. Marietu Ohunene Tenuche as the Acting Vice-Chancellor, of the state-owned Prince Abubakar Audu Unversity, Anyigba. Similarly, Governor Bello approved the appointment of Dr. Salisu Ogbo Usman as the Acting Rector of the Kogi State Polytechnic, Lokoja. In a statement by the Secretary to the State Government, SSG, Dr. (Mrs) Folashade Arike Ayoade, both appointments take immediate effect. Tenuche, a two-time Deputy Vice-Chancellor of the institution, replaces Prof. Mohammed Abdulkadir, who has been asked to proceed on terminal leave, while Usman replaces Prof. M. S. Atureta. The statement added that the later has been relieved of his appointment. Speculations were rife that the two former heads of the state institutions may not be reinstated when they were both suspended from their positions over alleged non-compliance with extant financial rules. The government while wishing the out-going appointees “the best in their future endeavours,” stressed that all handing and taking over be completed immediately.
