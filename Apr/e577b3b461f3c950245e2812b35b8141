Onipede said that the defendants violated a lawful order, contrary to and punishable under Section 203 of the Criminal Code, Law Cap C16, Laws of Ekiti State. He told the court that the clerics were arrested during the monitoring by security operatives, as directed by the state government, to curb the spread the CONVID-19 pandemic in the state.

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that while Ogundipe pleaded guilty to the charges, Adeuyi, however, told the court that he was not around when the security operatives came to arrest his fellow pastor. The Magistrate, Mr Lanre Owoleso, consequently convicted Ogundipe and ordered him to pay a fine of N150, 000 on the three-count charge, while Adeuyi was discharged for not being aware of the gathering. Owoleso ordered that the church be sealed off and that the pastor should provide the contact list of the church members who attended the service. (NAN)
