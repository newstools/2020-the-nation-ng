 One of the few women in the country, whose passion for galvanizing and equipping women from the stereotype to living their full potentials as nation builders, is Barr. Siju Iluyomade. The preacher, philanthropist, fashionista and public speaker, through her Arise Women Conference, has joined the fight against the spread of COVID-19 in Lagos State. Society Rendezvous gathered that the Lagos State Government recently took delivery of medical equipment from the stable of Arise Women in support of the battle against COVID-19 pandemic.  The charity organization which has continued to give support to the less privileged in the country for the past ten years made the presentation of the equipment on Monday, April 6 at the Infection Disease Centre, Yaba, Lagos. The Convener of Arise Women, Pastor Dr. Siju Iluyomade made the official presentation on behalf of the foundation alongside Dr. Tokunbo Oluwole, Mrs. Folashade Segun Olaiya. Close sources further added that the equipment donated by Arise Women Foundation includes surgical masks, hand sanitizers, hand gloves, ventilators and many other safety devices needed to help the frontline health workers.
