 An Ile-Ife Magistrates’ Court in Osun, on Monday, remanded one Ologbenla Toheeb, 18, over alleged theft of electrical wire in an uncompleted building. The Prosecutor, Insp Sunday Osanyintuyi, told the court that the defendant committed the offence on March 31, around 6 pm. at Fasina area, Ile-Ife. Osanyintuyi said that the defendant broke and entered into Mr Ondeku Ojo’s uncompleted building, with intent to commit felony. He added that the defendant stole electrical wire, valued at N150,000, at the uncompleted building. According to him, the offences contravene Sections 383, 390(9), 411 and 412 of the Criminal Code, Laws of Osun, 2002. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to three-count charge of breaking, entrance and stealing. The Defence Counsel, Mr Unah Sunday, pleaded the court to grant the defendant bail in the most liberal terms, pledging that his client would not jump bail, but would provide reliable sureties. The Magistrate, Joseph Owolawi, did not grant the defendant bail, but ordered that he be remanded in the custodial centre at Ile-Ife. Owolawi, thereafter, adjourned the case till May 13, for hearing.
