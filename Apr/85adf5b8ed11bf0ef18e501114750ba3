Osagie Otabor, Akure  An Akure High Court has admitted in evidence statements obtained by the Department of State Services from the founder of Sotitobire Praising Chapel, Akure, Alfa Babatunde, over last yearâ€™s missing child from his church, Gold Kolawole. Several persons including journalists were barred from entering inside the court premises due to coronavirus pandemic. All those allowed inside the court room were asked to wash their hands. Gold was one year old at the time he disappeared during a church service in November last year. At the resumed trial, a Senior official of the DSS, Mr. Yomi Olabiyi, presented before the court ,the evidence obtained from the defendants while in the custody of the agency. During cross examination, Director of Public Prosecution, Grace Olowoporoku, tendered the statements as evidence but Counsel to the defendants, Olusola Oke, opposed the position But the presiding Judge, Justice Olusegun Olusola, however, ruled that, Section 17 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Law, allowed a defendant to engage a counsel from the legal aid Council of Nigeria or a Justice of Peace to represent him when security agents elicit statements from suspects. He allowed admissibility of the statements made by the defendants as evidence for the trial on the basis that it was confirmed that a legal aid council of Nigeria was present at the time of obtaining the statement. The Judge however adjourned the case till April 27, May 11 and 17 for further hearing.
