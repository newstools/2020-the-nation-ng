 The late Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, Mallam Abba Kyari served Nigeria with all his heart, the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF) has said. The organisation said Kyari was a loyal friend of the President whose demise has created a huge vacuum that will be hard to fill. NSITF’s statement was expressed in a condolence message to Buhari and signed by the Managing Director/Chief Executive of the Fund, Adebayo Somefun. Kyari died on April 17 as a result of complications from coronavirus. He was buried the following day at the Gudu Cemetery, Abuja by officials of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control. Somefun said the late CoS was a man “endowed with uncommon attributes of diligence, intelligence, hard work loyalty to all his endeavour and helper of the underprivileged both within his immediate environment and beyond.”  It added: “We understand how particularly painful this loss is to you, especially knowing that he was above all, your very loyal, dedicated and trusted friend who served you and the nation at a time he was most needed. “We at the NSITF feel the pain and the loss, particularly in respect of wealth of his experience, professionalism and sterling leadership, leading us to having laudable achievements and successfully accomplishing some of the policies of your administration. “While we cannot question the Almighty over his passage, we can only submit to His Sovereign will. “As the entire nation mourns with you, we earnestly pray that the Almighty Allah solidify your faith and grant you the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss.”
