Airports will not reopen for commercial flights on Thursday, Aviation Minister Hadi Sirika confirmed on Monday. Sirika announced the extension of airports closure by two weeks. The airports, which were initially shut as part of efforts to control the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) were projected to reopen on April 23. On March 23, the Federal Government announced the closure of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Lagos and the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport Abuja for one month in the first instance as part of measures to combat the coronavirus scourge. Sirika explained that the new projected date of opening of airport operations is consequent upon the two weeks extension of the lockdown by President Muhammadu Buhari. The extension was contained in a statement issued in Abuja yesterday by the Director of Public Affairs in the Aviation ministry, James Odaudu. The statement reads: “As a result of the extension on lockdown by Mr. President, it is no longer possible for us to open our airspace and airports for normal operations by the 23rd April, 2020.” The minister also explained that the new projected date of reopening will be subject to review. He however appealed to air travellers and all stakeholders in the aviation industry to see the extension and the other measures taken by the government as necessary sacrifices to safeguard the health and well-being of Nigerians.
