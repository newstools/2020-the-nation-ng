 MAVIN Records artiste, Sidney Onoriode Esiri famously known as Dr. Sid, has advised his fans to learn new skills during the stay at home occasioned by the fight against coronavirus. The rapper and singer announced via a tweet. He said while the Federal Government has extended the lockdown in Lagos, Ogun and the FCT Abuja, it is the best time to learn a new skill rather than waste the whole time doing nothing. “If you can, try and learn a new skill”, he wrote. “I hope everyone is hanging in there, #stayhomeandstaysafe. These are tough times for all of us. Mental Health is extremely important, let’s take care of our minds as well as our bodies.” Dr. Sid is one of the oldest music acts on Don Jazzy’s Mavins record. Sid had joined the record label following the fall out between D’banj and Don Jazzy, which led to the end of Mo’ Hit Records.
