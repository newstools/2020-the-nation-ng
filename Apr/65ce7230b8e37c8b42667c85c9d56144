 TWO Chinese men have been arrested by police in Zamfara State for illegal gold mining. The suspects simply identified as Wang and Chu were apprehended on Sunday by a team led by Commissioner of Police Usman Nagogo at Nasarawa Burkullu village in Kwali, Bukkuyum Local Government Area. It was gathered that their arrests followed a tip-off. Police spokesman Mohammed Shehu said, “The information proved to be credible as hundreds of miners scattered as soon as they saw the team. Two labourers were arrested who confirmed the presence of Chinese and Burkinabe nationals, among others. “On April 25, information had it that Chinese and Burkinabe nationals were taking shelter somewhere in Nasarawa Burkullu. On April 26, the Commissioner of Police led another team to the same village where two Chinese nationals were seen with all the chemicals necessary for making gold. The two Chinese nationals were being interrrogated, Shehu said.
