 A governorship aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) and South West National Vice Chairman of the party, Dr. Eddy Olafeso, has carpeted Ondo Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu efforts at curbing spread of the coronavirus. Akeredolu had on Friday said the State was well equipped to treat its index COVID-10 case with plans to build more isolation centres in the three senatorial district. But Olafeso said the Governor should push for a testing centre to be in Ondo State rather than Ede in Osun State. Olafeso, in a chat with our reporter, urged Akeredolu to be at par with the Lagos State Government in terms of preparation and response to COVID-19.  Olafeso stated that COVID-19 would not stop the PDP from conducting its state congresses to elect new state executive ahead of the party primaries. According to him: “There is no testing facility in Ondo and the earlier the state government do something the better. We will encourage the state government to do everything possible to be at par with the state of preparedness in Lagos State where the corona virus is taking seriously. There is lackadaisical attitude here. It is too wayback. We are dealing with a ferocious terrible disease and that is why there should be a testing facility. “We have to have our centre to deal with ferocious disease. The lockdown is not okay in this state. We must pay attention to this. We must keep to staying at home.”
