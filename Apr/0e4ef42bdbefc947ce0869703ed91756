The timely intervention of the Lagos State Fire Service saved additional 10 shops from being razed. The inferno occurred at Peace Estate near Ogidan Bus Stop on Lekki/Epe Expressway. Acting Head of Lagos State Mrs Margaret Adeseye said the firefighters prevented a row of electronic products’ shops from being razed. She explained that the fire call was received and Lekki Phase 1 Fire Station was immediately deployed to put out the fire. The inferno, she said, was burning 19 shops of various sizes, where electronic products of different brands are being sold. “Nine out of the 19 shops were severely burnt while the firemen were able to save 10 among others with properties worth millions of naira amidst the difficult challenges posed by COVID 19 pandemic,” she said. The fire boss pointed out that the fire was however doused with additional support of a second fire crew of the Lagos State Fire Service and the Federal Fire Service. She cautioned Lagosians that fire don’t go on holiday as evident in the 84 fire calls attended to since March 23 when Governor, Babajide Olusola Sanwoolu gave a sit at home order to grade level 1-12. She commended the efforts of the firemen at ensuring a safe Lagos and working in tandem with the security and governance agenda of the government. She assured them of the readiness of Governor Sanwo-Olu to support the service to enable them perform better. Mrs Adeseye appealed to Lagosians to see the new 14 days lockdown as a good intention to further contain the spread of the deadly COVID-19 pandemic. She urged Lagosians to follow the rules put in place by health experts, adding that this is the only way to contain the spread of the disease and encourage the government to remove the restriction order.
