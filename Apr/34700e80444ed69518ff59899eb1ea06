 A FEDERAL High Court in Abuja has rejected the request by the Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) for the revocation of the bail granted the Chairman of the defunct Pension Reform Task Team (PRTT), Abdulrasheed Maina. The court also declined the request by Maina for a further variation of the conditions attached to the bail granted him on November 26, 2019. These decisions are contained in two rulings delivered yesterday by Justice Okon Abang in two applications by the EFCC and Maina. The first ruling was on a motion on notice in which the EFCC sought the revocation of the bail granted him on the grounds that Maina, being tried on money laundering related charges, had allegedly perfected plan to escape from custody and assassinate the prosecuting lawyer and prosecutionâ€™s witnesses. Justice Abang held that it was premature for the court to take a definite position on the issue, because there is evidence before the court that the allegations by the prosecution have been established by any security agency.
