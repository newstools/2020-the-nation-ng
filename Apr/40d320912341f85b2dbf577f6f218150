ODION Ighalo has tipped his fellow Nigerian Victor Osimhen for the top, as the Lille forward has again been linked with Manchester United. Osimhen has enjoyed a fine first season at Lille in Ligue 1, scoring 18 goals in 38 appearances as he’s helped the French side cover for the absence of their former star Nicolas Pepe, who left for Arsenal last summer. Those goals have seen the 21-year-old linked with several moves across Europe, with United among those said to be interested in Ighalo’s international teammate. And the Red Devils loanee is a big fan of the former Wolfsburg and Charleroi forward, who paid a visit to watch United against Club Brugge in the Europa League in February. “I talk to Osimhen, he’s a very nice boy, young, he’s a good guy,” Ighalo said.  “We talk, not almost every day, but almost every time I advise him. He’s the future of Nigerian football. He’s the future, he’s going to do so well in football. “I always advise him to keep calm, keep working hard and the guy is going to be a celebrity, you know. “He came to watch our game against Club Brugge in Belgium because it’s closer to where he lives, he messaged me he was going to come so I gave him my jersey, and in fact he brought his own jersey for me, too. “Osimhen is a nice boy, we’re from the same place. I love him, he’s down to earth, he’s hard working, he has a future and he has the mentality of a winner, that’s what I love about him. He has that lion’s heart. “I love him, I just want him to keep working hard the way he’s doing, he’s going to break so many records in Europe and Nigeria.”
