The Director-General, Lagos State Safety Commission (LSSC), Mr. Lanre Mojola and General Manager, Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency (LASEPA), Dr. Dolapo Fasawe, have urged Lagosians not to spread the Coronavirus. They said people should maintain social distancing and carry out basic hygiene practices such as regular washing of hands. The officials spoke yesterday when the COVID-19 joint task force on enforcement of social distancing and gathering visited the Oloja of Epe, Oba Kamorudeen Ishola Animashaun, in his palace. Mojola said that the team was in Epe to distribute stimulus welfare packages to the community following the lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  “Social distancing at this point in the history of our dear nation is crucial to flatten the curve and break the cycle of transmission of the virus. Let me also urge residents to adhere to other safety rules such as regular washing of our hands at all times as well as avoiding shaking hands with one another. This will assist in curtailing the spread of the pandemic,” he said. Dr. Fasawe noted that the joint task force will enforce breached guidelines until people understand and appreciate the importance of social distancing and self-isolation. Oba Animashaun thanked the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration for the kind gesture and pledged the support of Epe community in combating the pandemic.
