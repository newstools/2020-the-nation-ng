David De Gea continues to rack up the records at Manchester United, and most recently ascended to fourth place on the list of goalkeepers with the cleanest sheets for the club. The Spaniard’s performance in the 2-0 victory over Manchester City earlier this month took him to 138 shut-outs for United – three clear of Edwin van der Sar (135). De Gea had drawn level with his Dutch predecessor thanks to the 0-0 draw against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 1 February, and then surpassed him after the winter break via another pristine showing against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, where Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side triumphed 2-0. Only Gary Bailey (161), Alex Stepney (175) and Peter Schmeichel (180) boast a greater tally of clean sheets than the Madrileno and, at just 29 years old, De Gea should have plenty of time to topple their totals. The former Atletico Madrid goalkeeper has endured a testing season, with uncharacteristic mistakes at Vicarage Road and Goodison Park inviting a higher level of scrutiny on his performances, but De Gea has been an integral part of the Reds’ recent defensive improvement, which has wrought nine clean sheets in the last 11 games.
