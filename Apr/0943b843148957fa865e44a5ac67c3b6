U.S Democratic presidential candidate, Bernie Sanders, has ended his presidential bid, making former Vice President, Joe Biden, the presumptive nominee to face Republican President, Donald Trump, in November. His decision comes as the country grapples with the Coronavirus outbreak that has affected the nominating schedule, with some primaries postponed, and others up in the air. Sanders, 78, called it a “difficult and painful decision” but said he would stay on the ballot in future primaries and continue to gather delegates in order to push the Democratic platform toward his populist anti-corporate agenda, including a government-run healthcare system and tax hikes for the rich. He mounted an unexpectedly strong challenge in 2016 to eventual Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, but has been under pressure to halt his campaign this year after Joe Biden won resounding victories in Florida, Arizona and Illinois.
