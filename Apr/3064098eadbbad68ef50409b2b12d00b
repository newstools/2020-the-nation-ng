 All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship aspirant in Ondo State  Ifeoluwa Oyedele has said that the state deserves a dynamic governor. He said the challenges confronting the state are enormous, stressing that only a competent and knowledgeable administrator can make a difference. Oyedele said Governor Rotimi Akeredolu has not lived to the expectation of the ruling party, adding that many party chieftains are ready to  compete for the governorship ticket with him at the primary. He said he is eminently qualified to succeed him, based on his track record  capacity, understanding of the challenges and desire to unite the party and the state. Oyedele spoke on his ambition during a brief visit to the Lagos office of Vintage Press, publisher of The Nation. The engineer lamented the absence of industries in Ondo State, following the failure of successive administrations to build on the foundation laid by former Governor Adekunle Ajasin. He said the Unity Forum is working hard to ensure that a credible candidate emerges at the proposed APC primary.  The aspirant said contenders who belong to the forum have resolved to support the candidate at the primary and election. He said Ondo APC is prepared for the pol, which, he said, will be a turning point. Oyedele said the next governor will have a lot to do in terms of building infrastructure, industrialisation and sports development. He said zoning will play a critical role during the primary and election. Oyedele said APC will retain its hold on Ondo State, adding that the mistakes of the past will not be repeated. He added: “During the National Assembly elections, we lost two senators and some House of Representatives seats. We lost the presidential election. But, we won the House of Assembly elections. APC will win the governorship election.”
