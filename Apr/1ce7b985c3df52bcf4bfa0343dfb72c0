 Ex-Super Eagles winger  Finidi George is still unhappy at his unproductive spell with then English Premier League  side (EPL)  Ipswich Town. George left Real Mallorca for England in the summer of 2001 for 3.1million pounds with high expectations that he would help the Portman Road based team become a mainstay in the EPL under George Burley. The midfielder actually began well and even scored twice against Derby County in a 3-1 home win but he thereafter underwhelmed and could not help the team remain in the English topflight and had to leave at the end of the season. Finidi told journalists that it was  the injury he copped in the early period of the season that forced him to stay out of action for over one month that contributed to his uneventful stint with Ipswich.  “Yeah, what happened  at Ipswich Town  was really unfortunate because I went there with  high spirits and high hopes,” George began in an interview. “Actually I started the league season  with them on a high note but after the third or fourth game I broke my cheekbone against Fulham when somebody elbowed me and I had to go through a surgery on my cheekbone which kept me out for three or four weeks. “When I came back,  I started  playing  again trying to get match fitness but when I was almost match fit and getting  back to the same rhythm  before I sustained  the injury I had to go for Nations Cup and by the time I came back the team was already  struggling and there nothing I could do. “That was sad story that I didn’t expect it would end up that way but it was the reality.  I broke my cheekbone and I later went for the AFCON and when I came back the team was struggling. “We tried but it was not possible to keep the team in the topflight. The team got relegated and they went into administration and we all had to leave. It was a short spell and it was unfortunate.”
