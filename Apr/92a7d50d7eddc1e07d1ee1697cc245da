 INTERNATIONAL Distillers Limited, Ota, has supported Ogun State’s effort at cushioning effects of the COVID-19 lockdown by donating hundreds of bags of rice and cartons of Indomie to the Community Development Associations (CDAs) and vulnerable persons in Ota. Ota Factory’s General Manager Adesina Adegoke, who spoke with reporters on the factory premises, said the organisation had tried to complement government’s role in  providing stimulus to Nigerians. He said government’s efforts were not felt because of the sheer population of the poor and vulnerable, hence the company was assisting the state in achieving result. Mr Olakunle  Ajayi, of Crown Royal CDA; Mr Charles Isibor of Covenant Garden CDA; and Mr Adeshina Abiodun of Unity Estate CDA thanked IDL for coming to their aid.
