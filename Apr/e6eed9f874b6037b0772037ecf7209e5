Federal Government on Thursday received from the United Nations vital medical supplies to support the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The supplies contained 10,000 test kits, 15 oxygen concentrators, and various personal protective equipment (PPE), and other vital health supplies, to support the Federal Government’s COVID-19 Response Plan. The PPEs will protect medical personnel and ancillary staff in the frontline, providing care and treatment to people affected by the virus. Also, the kits will enable health care workers test those who suspect they have the virus, to verify their health status. UN Resident Coordinator in Nigeria Edward Kallon said: “We know that to limit spread of the virus, it is important to test as many people as possible, especially those with recent travel history and those who came into contact with travellers. “These test kits will support Nigeria’s drive to control the transmission of COVID-19 infections and support the government’s strong efforts to protect the country from an escalating pandemic. “Working closely together with the government and other partners, including the private sector, is the surest way of preventing and containing the COVID-19 pandemic. We are grateful for the support of the EU and IHS in getting these vital supplies to strengthen the UN’s efforts in helping Nigeria to address the COVID-19 challenge.” Since the outbreak of the coronavirus in Nigeria in late February, the UN has helped Nigeria to respond to the pandemic through risk communications and community engagement, infection prevention and control, epidemiology/surveillance and management of coronavirus cases. Working with government and other partners, the UN is developing and disseminating messages, infographics, and audio-visual material informing the public about the risks of COVID-19, and how to protect oneself.
