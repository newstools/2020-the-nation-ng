 A former governor is tired of being a Senator because the chamber is a leveler with the President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan as primus inter pares( first among equals). Having been used to Executive powers with retinue of aides, the ex-governor prefers to dump the Senate to be the National Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) where he can call the shots.  This is a dilemma which President Muhammadu Buhari would have to resolve because the North-East Zone of the party had agreed to concede the slot to Borno State. The matter is said to be too hot for the National Chairman of APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole to address. It is either the party allows the former governor to have his way or he is pacified with a juicy appointment. But the ex-governor, without mincing words, is tired of the Red Chamber.
