The Katsina State committee on COVID-19 headed by Deputy Governor Manir Yakubu, has called on citizens to report any returnee from Lagos and Abuja. The chairman of the sensitisation sub-committee and Commissioner for Information, Hadi Mohamed Serika, told reporters on Tuesday, that the house to house search for returnees have become necessary because some of them escaped and evaded screening at the border. He said; “the committee has been receiving calls from members of the public reporting people suspected to be living with the virus. He said the committee is liaising with the Technical and Emergency response committee to ensure that such people are identified, isolated and their samples taken for testing.” “Since the emergence of the index case, the Katsina State government has remained focused and committed to its cause in curtailing the further spread of the virus, identifying possible suspects, isolating ND testing them.”
