Oyo State Governor, Engineer Seyi Makinde on Tuesday, kicked off a rapid testing initiative for COVID-19 in the State, declaring that the outcome of the exercise would help contain the spread of the virus. Governor Makinde, who declared open the COVID-19 Drive-Through/Walk-Through Testing, an initiative that is expected to test 2,000 samples within two weeks, at the Lekan Salami Stadium, Adamasingba, Ibadan, said the rapid testing initiative aligned to his administrationâ€™s commitment to test at least 10,000 residents within a short time. He appreciated the Citizen for Citizen, a non-governmental organisation headed by the chairman of First Bank Nigeria, Mrs. Ibukun Awosika, which provided the 2,000 testing kits and the LifeBank Nigeria, for partnering with the State on rapid testing for COVID-19.
