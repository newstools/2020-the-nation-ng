 A minor disagreement over unpaid electricity bills on Sunday March 29 at House 78 Amudalatu Street, Agodo, Egbe, a Lagos suburb, ended on a brutal note when the landlord’s wife, Alice, allegedly picked up a razor and sliced the face of a female tenant, Mariam Peter, leaving her with a bloodied face and deep gash. The landlord’s wife was seized and handed over to the police at Ikotun Division, where she was detained for three days while the victim was taken to a hospital for treatment.  Initial report suggested that the victim and other tenants in the building had allegedly defaulted in payment of electricity bills, prompting their disconnection by the officials of an electricity distribution company penultimate Monday. However, neighbours said the duo had been at loggerhead lately over flimsy differences. For example, it was said that the victim recently beat up the landlord’s wife and left her with a scar on her body during the fight. Police spokesman, Bala Elkana, said the suspect would be arraigned in court after the current lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus disease.
