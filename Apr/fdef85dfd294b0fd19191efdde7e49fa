Two Premier League clubs and another from the Spanish La Liga have submitted bids for Victor Osimhen, reports Sky Sports. The Lille striker has been a top target for several top clubs in Europe after he netted 18 goals for Ligue 1 side Lille this season. Arsenal, Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Liverpool and Chelsea are among the clubs who have been linked with Osimhen. Barcelona is believed to be the Spanish club keen on the all-action striker. Lille snapped up the 21-year-old striker at the start of the season from Belgian club Sporting Charleroi for about 13 million Euros. They are now prepared to sell him for around 80 million Euros even as the Super Eagles striker himself has said Lille will decide his future.
