The experience has been good even though it is not that easy being a foreigner in a country like India.” On how she was able to breakthrough in a foreign market, the actress says, “I think that would be my appearance in the popular film platform, Netflix web with a series film production entitled: Little Things, Season three. I think that was how I felt I had made a good impression that led to my breakthrough as many have suggested.” The Babcock University graduate also noted that she’s happy using her talent to promote Nigeria in India through the movie. “This is something I am good at and they see that.
