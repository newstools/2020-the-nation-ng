 The man who was quarantined in Gashaka, Taraba state following a suspected case of Coronavirus has tested negative, Commissioner for Health Innocent Vakkai revealed Wednesday. Vakkai said the suspected patient had sore throat and nasal congestion which are some of the symptoms of the pandemic. He was referred to government for advice. But when a sample from his throat was taken to Abuja, it was tested and confirmed by the Nigeria Centre for Disease and Control (NCDC) as negative. He added that while awaiting his result, the patient was isolated at a centre in Baruwa, Gashaka, to prevent him from traveling up to Jalingo, during which he would have had contact with other people. Vakkai spoke during a press conference by Deputy Governor Haruna Manu. Manu, who briefed newsmen in Government House on behalf of Governor Darius Ishaku, said no index case has been reported in Taraba State. The deputy governor on Wednesday ordered the closure of all markets in the state. He also suspended the Muslim and Christian prayer gatherings. Manu said: “Let me assure you that there is no single reported case of the virus in Taraba state, and we are determined to keep it that way.”
