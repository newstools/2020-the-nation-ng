Augustine Okezie, Katsina  The Katsina State Government is considering imposing a 14-day total lockdown on the state as part of sweeping measures to checkmate the spread of the Coronavirus pandemic that is already indexed in the state. The Permanent Secretary of the State Ministry of Health and member of the state COVID-19 Committee, Dr Kabir Mustapha told The Nation exclusively through a text message that the government is thinking about imposing a lockdown of the state, although he didn’t provide further details. There have been growing calls in the state especially by Civil Society Groups and concerned citizens for the imposition of a 14 day lockdown to enable the state government complete contact tracing on the index case, quarantine those identified, fumigate the state and improve on testing and screening of potential carriers Haruna Abdul Hamid, Secretary of Coalition of Civil Society Organization in Katsina State, told newsmen in Katsina that the action is long overdue and most especially considering the vulnerability of the people of the state exposed by the index case. He said ’’The stand of the coalition is that people are aware of this ban on social gathering by the government and with recent discovered case in Daura, people are saying Katsina should be looked down even as the Government relaxed the ban on Juma’at prayers’’. Also, another coalition member, Ibrahim Sogiji while calling for the lockdown said the implications of the recording of the first case at Daura are numerous including the fact that it is a border town from to Niger Republic which is not more than 30 km and that it has an international market around Maia’dua, Baure, and other strategic places. He said ’’Residents of Daura and its environs have a certain culture where they use to travel to Lagos and other neighbouring states for trade. It has no link with state Radio, neither the FM nor the state Radio but they have a television station call NTA’’. ‘’You can lockdown Daura and its environs alone though the town is a root to Niger Republic, Kano, Katsina and Jigawa but it will not have the needed impact. So it should be a states wide lock down with provisions for palliatives’’ The NGO further called for a synergy between the state COVID-19 Committee, the National Committee and several other civil society groups to compliment the effort of the state government.
