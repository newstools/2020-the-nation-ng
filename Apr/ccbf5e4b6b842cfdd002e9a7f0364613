Youths and Sports Development Minister Sunday Dare has urged Nigerian  athletes to keep hope alive on the occasion of the International Day of Sports for Development and Peace despite  the COVID-19 pandemic. Dare said: “On this historic day of the celebration of the United Nations  International Day of Sports  Development and Peace which is celebrated soberly due to the COVID-19 scourge, I urge all our sports men and women to remain steadfast, strong and  to keep hope alive. As athletes, you remain the beacon of hope to unite Nigerians to commemorate the United Nations  International  Day of Sports  and Peace. The minister declared that  sports must be used  to foster peace, unity as well as  support to those that are  down, even as he canvassed for health living and meaningful  exercises in homes, walk in the park and stay safe tips. “ When we stay together, we win together.  In the spirit of sportsmanship, we must never give up the fight against  the spread  of  COVID-19. This fleeting, sober moment for sports, business, social , and  economic meltdown will pass and we shall emerge victorious,” he said. Dare then affirmed that the role of sports in global unity is crucial: “Sports remains the most powerful tool that unites the world during peace and war, and this experience would only strengthen our resolve to win always,” the minister said.” It encourages every Nigerian not to allow their spirit to be dampened, but use the occasion of the International Day of Sports and Peace to spread the message of peace through sports.” He added: “Despite the sobering moment, the world will always celebrate the advent of the modern Olympics which coincides with the World Sports Day. Sports can be used to drive change, unite the world and keep hope alive even in challenging times like this.”
