Boris Johnson’s pregnant fiancée, Carrie Symonds, said she has been suffering with coronavirus symptoms and has spent the past week in bed. She shared the news on Twitter – adding that, after resting for seven days, she is now feeling better. Symonds wrote: “I’ve spent the past week in bed with the main symptoms of Coronavirus. “I haven’t needed to be tested and, after seven days of rest, I feel stronger and I’m on the mend.” Ms Symonds shared advice for pregnant women, who are considered to be one of the categories most at risk, tweeting a link to the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. She tweeted: “Being pregnant with Covid-19 is obviously worrying. “To other pregnant women, please do read and follow the most up to date guidance which I found to be reassuring.” Health minister Nadine Dorries, who was the first MP to be diagnosed with coronavirus, tweeted: “I’ve been speaking to @carriesymonds regularly throughout. “She presented with and has been through the classic signs and symptoms most people experience with #COVID19. “She is now recovering and getting stronger day by day. #InThisTogether.” It comes after Boris Johnson tested positive for the virus on March 27 – but remains isolated amid reports the virus ‘hit him hard’. In a video message he posted on social media on Thursday, the leader insisted he is feeling better despite a high temperature. Shortly after the PM announced he tested positive for Covid-19, Ms Symonds – who usually lives with the PM in the Number 11 flat – shared a photograph of herself self-isolating in Camberwell, south London, with the couple’s dog Dilyn. Mr Johnson, 55, is expecting his first child with 32-year-old Carrie Symonds in the summer. While pregnant women do not appear more likely to contract coronavirus than the general population, pregnancy itself alters the body’s immune system and response to viral infections in general.
