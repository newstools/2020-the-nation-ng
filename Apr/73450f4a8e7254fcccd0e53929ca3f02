The African Democratic Congress (ADC) has urged the Federal Government to upgrade the healthcare facilities in the country to curbing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The National Vice-Chairman, North-East of the party, Alhaji Manzo Ibrahim, made the call in a chat with newsmen on Monday in Bauchi. He said that health facilities, sanitation, poverty level as well as the leadership style called for proper and collective assessment in order to tackle them. “The advent of the novel COVID-19 across the world has triggered change in most countries, including Nigeria. “It has become a phenomenal incident that challenges virtually every stratum of human existence and it needs the attention of all the nations of the world,” he said. Ibrahim noted that Nigeria’s health facilities were in a near collapse, with outdated facilities and inadequate health personnel.
He noted that the sanitary conditions in most communities across the country were very poor. “This situation has been compounded by the inability of government to evacuate dirt promptly, coupled with lack of adequate supervision of waste collection and disposal,” he said. Ibrahim also expressed concerned over what he called alarming rate of poverty among the populace in the country. The party stalwart expressed worries about the social investment programme of the federal government, saying that the approach was inappropriate. He said that the country should look inward to address its various challenges. Ibrahim said that the North-East region, in particular needed prompt and decisive actions against its diverse challenges.
“No one will come down from China, EU or America to solve our problems for us,” the ADC chieftain said. (NAN)
