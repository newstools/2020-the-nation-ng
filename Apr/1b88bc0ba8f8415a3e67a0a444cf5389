Prof. Olanrewaju Fagbohun (SAN), Vice-Chancellor, Lagos State University (LASU), Ojo has urged students of the institution to keep learning during the lockdown period by studying online. Fagbohun, who made the appeal in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday in Lagos, said that the university was putting in place online platforms for use by the students. He said that the platforms would include whatsapp, drop box, static pages on the varsity’s website, Google classroom and free conferences, among others. “Recently, LASU management had a meeting online with all deans of faculties, Provost of the LASU College of Medicine and the Dean, Post-Graduate School to agree on the modality for online lectures for our students. “We agreed that the final year students should be assigned their project work so that their supervisors can engage them while they are at home. “We also have a LASU assignment portal designed by LASU Computer Science Department for students and a Whatsapp platform to conduct tutorials for all the lecturers who will be engaged in the online teaching. “Tomorrow (April 10), we are having another meeting with all faculties on how far they have gone with the online lectures,” he said. Fagbohun said that the idea was to continually engage LASU students and keep them learning until school reopened. He was optimistic many of the students would engage the different platforms. The VC urged Nigerian students to abide by efforts of the federal and state governments to contain COVID-19 spread. (NAN)
