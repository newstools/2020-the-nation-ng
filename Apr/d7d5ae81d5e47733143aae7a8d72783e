Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq has directed the 193 wards across the state to form committees to deepen enlightenment on the COVID-19 pandemic. He said they should also own the campaign against community transmission of the virus. “The governor says the time calls for everyone to take responsibility for our collective safety. He, therefore, encourages the wards to form their own COVID-19 committees. “They can pattern their own committees after the template already established at the state level,” spokesman for the governor, Rafiu Ajakaye, said in a statement yesterday. He added: “They can have subcommittees, especially in the area of public enlightenment on COVID-19, how to prevent its spread and how to support those who are the hardest hit by the stay-at-home directive in their areas.” The statement said the main focus is for “our people to take ownership of the campaign against the spread of the virus in their communities and areas of influence.” AbdulRazaq praised the Offa Descendants Union (ODU) and Alanamu Ward for establishing their own COVID-19 committees to support the government. “We want to see this initiative replicated across the state. We all need to take responsibility for our health. We commend ODU and Alanamu Ward for their proactiveness. This has helped to deepen awareness in these areas. Government is very pleased with the development. It is commendable,” the statement added. The governor hailed the Federal Government for the technical and material support being offered to Kwara State, including the recent donation of one ventilator and three oxygen concentrators by the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA).
