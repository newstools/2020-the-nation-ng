Celebrated humour merchant, Kelvin Anagbogu, alias Lord Lamba recently explained how he reveals lies frequently told by Nigerian men to the public. The Nigerian comedian who was born on the 4th of May 1995 in Lagos State nicknamed himself ‘Lord Lamba’ which means lord of lies at the inception of his comedy business online. The young man, whose comedy is niched based on lies people tell, built a funny and compelling persona that ridicules common human flaws. Owing to the distinct nature of his comedy, it didn’t take long for him to gain relevance online. When asked how he was able to build his online presence in such a short while.  “I would say it’s because I am doing something different from what others are doing. I came out in a different way and brought an entirely different concept to what people are used to. We all lie every day, so I try to explore that area and come up with different unique concepts and people don’t get tired of them. “Whenever I upload skits, my videos are usually reposted by others and in a day, I could get about seven thousand followership requests. People often reach out to me and tell me how much they love my concepts. “Some even tell me that I am exposing their lies and that people would no longer fall for those lies. Some girls send me messages to thank me for exposing some of the lies that guys tell them. I laugh when I get those comments and I feel appreciated too,” he explained. Even though he receives backlash from his fellow men who are against what he is doing, Kelvin claims to stand his ground in exposing such lies because he totally condemns them. He claims his skits are didactic and aim at making people become better.
