The Cannes Film Festival will not be held this year in “its original form” due to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, organisers said on Tuesday. The festival will nevertheless be made “real” in 2020, “in a way or another”, they added in a statement. The film festival, one of the largest in the world, was initially due to take place from May 12-23. (NAN)
