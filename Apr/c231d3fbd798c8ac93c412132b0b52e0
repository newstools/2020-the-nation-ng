 NIGERIAN-American professional basketball player Chinenye “Chiney” Ogwumike has joined the Jr. NBA at Home initiative as part of NBA Together programme showing young players how to become adept in the three point throw. In a one minute video on twitter, the Los Angeles Sparks of the Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA) set up a miniature hoop in her doorway taking her throws with a small ball. She made most of the shots but could not beat the time set by Miles Brown, an American actor and dancer. The 6′ 3” power forward who was happy to be an inspiration to the junior players and part of the laudable initiatives urged other players to have fun with the NBA Challenge.  “I accept your challenge Miles. I know a lot of people can go out right so I make my mini hoop in the house. I lost but I want everyone to have fun with the NBA Jr. Challenge. The Jr. NBA at Home initiative is part of NBA Together, a global community and social engagement campaign that aims to support, engage, educate and inspire youth, families and fans in response to the coronavirus pandemic. NBA Together continues as NBA and WNBA players, coaches and legends get online and participate in Jr. NBA at Home and NBA Together Live initiatives.
