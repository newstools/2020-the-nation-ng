 The Federal Teaching Hospital, Ido-Ekiti (FETHI) has restated its determination to deliver quality health care to Nigerians. The management of the tertiary health institution said despite the huge spending on new equipment, the hospital still offers the cheapest medical services compared to its counterparts in other part of the country. It added that a novel way of expanding the revenue base of the institution had been devised, which assisted it in meeting some immediate needs. FETHI said this to a larger extent assisted it in the procurement of medical equipment worth millions of Naira to enhance and boost its medical services to the people. It said the equipment were injected into its key departments and sections.  Addressing reporters after the on-the- spot assessment of the new gadgets, the Chief Medical Director (CMD), Prof. Kunle Ajayi, who expressed joy about the development, said it was made possible through the cooperation of stakeholders in the institution. Some of the newly procured  equipment, according to him,  included Sysmex  5 Parts Heamatology Analyser, Automated Chemistry Analyser, Automated Blood Culture Machine and Automated Semen Analyser, among others. Prof. Ajayi said that the intervention had reduced the level of waiting time for laboratory results without compromising standards, thus improving patient care. The CMD said that prudent management of the little resources accruing to the hospital was the secret of the feat attained in the last two years. The hospital’s theatre named after one of its deceased workers, Tunde Aladesanmi, has now become three star ultra- modern theatre complex with refurbished Recovery Room, Theatre Manager and Nurse Station. The new Accident & Emergency Unit being built by the management is also nearing completion.
