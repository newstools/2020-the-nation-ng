 FIRE on Monday gutted a part of Sapele Correctional Centre in Delta State during a protest by inmates. The Nation gathered that the inmates were protesting against a new policy that bars visitors from the facility, as well as against alleged poor treatment by officials. Visitors often donate food and other necessities to the inmates during such visits. Cause of the fire was sketchy at press time. There was heavy security at the centre. Commissioner of Police Hafiz Inuwa confirmed the incident, saying the command was looking into the issue.
