James Azania, Lokoja  A herd of twenty cows have reportedly collapsed and died on a field of the Felele main campus of the Kogi State Polytechnic, Lokoja. The cows were said to have entered into the farm to graze, Thursday afternoon, leading to the linking of the cause of their death to suspected food poisoning, probably from herbicides, used on farms. A call was put through to a staff of the institution who confirmed the story to The Nation. A lecturer in the Department of General Studies of the state-owned institution, however, said that about twelve cows grazing close to the school fence died. He said that the likely problem that may arise will be between the owner of the farmland and herders. “Yes, I was told that twelve cows died on a farm close to the school fence. You know that we are not allowed on the campus right now; the school is closed. It will be a problem between the farmers and the Fulanis. I’m not in school,” said the academic, who pleaded anonymity.
