 Budding musical talent, Ojuyenum George, aka Exotika says he found his voice on the streets while growing up as an orphan. Losing both parents at six and getting disowned by his paternal family, Exotika says he had to rely on his poor maternal grandmother to survive. Living with his grandmother evoked a new found love in music as the aged woman was a revered folklore singer in her native community. Exotika said his life was full of pains as a young orphan but he found solace in music and took to the street to cater for himself and his aged grandmother. “I cried in despair because I never believed in better days ahead due to my predicaments. My grandmother always encouraged me never to give up. I did all kinds of menial jobs as a child to sustain myself, my poor grandmother, and pay for my education,” he said.  Continuing, Exotika said, “Street credibility taught me both sides of life – how to win and count my loss. I saved for my education via street hustling. When I gained admission to study accounting, I met friends in school who love music and became a member of their band. It was then I recognised that music was the main reason why I live and see music to be a way of letting the world know that mankind must love each other to survive.” The 26-year-old singer made his official debut in 2018 with the single, ‘Blessings’ after which he released his second single, ‘Dey for you’ in 2019.
