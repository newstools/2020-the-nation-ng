 The Commissioner of Police in Kebbi, Mr Agunbiade Oluyemi-Lasore, on Friday expressed dismay over the attitude of some filling stations owners and traders in the state who took advantage of COVID-19 to hike prices of foods items and other products. The commissioner in a statement issued by the police spokesman in the state, DSP Nafi’u Abubakar, said “filling stations, food vendors, pure water companies and sellers of other essential items are using the hard period to hoard and increase the prices of their products to members of the general public in the State.” The statement added, “in light of the above, the Commissioner of police  therefore, appeals to businessmen generally in the state to stop further increase of prices of products in order to  ease the hardship being experienced by the people of Kebbi.” He therefore warned that  “Consequently the police command in collaboration with other security agencies in the state would not hesitate to deal decisively with any person or group of persons hoarding or increasing the price of any item or product especially food items in the state.”
