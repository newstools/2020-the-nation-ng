As Christians in Ogun State join their counterparts all over the world to celebrate Easter, the state governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, at the weekend, called on residents and citizens of Ogun State to continue playing their roles as committed citizens through love and sacrifice for the general good of the society. He said the stay-at-home measure is meant to flatten the curve of coronavirus and it is one major sacrifice of our freedom that we all must make at this period of the deadliest pandemic known to mankind. In his Easter Message to the people, Abidoun said it is only through love and sacrifice toward the good of society that the people could uphold the legacy of Jesus Christ which is encapsulated in His selfless love and sacrifice on behalf of humanity.  According to Abiodun, “The greatest legacy that Jesus Christ left for us is the legacy of love and sacrifice. I believe the best way we can carry on that legacy is to fulfill our obligations to our society by doing what is right always and by being our brother’s keeper”. A statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Kunle Somorin quoted him as saying, “As Easter symbolises triumph over trials and travails, by God’s grace, Ogun State, Nigeria and humanity will triumph over COVID-19 stronger and more prosperous”,
