Some Tiv leaders have called on the Federal Government to investigate the alleged involvement of soldiers in an attack on Tiv farmers. President-General of Mzough-U-Tiv, a socio-cultural organisation, Iorbee Ihagh, alleged that soldiers accompanied Jukun militias who last Wednesday allegedly attacked Jootar community, a Tiv settlement on the border between Benue and Taraba states. Three Tiv farmers were reportedly killed in the attack while houses, vehicles and foodstuff burnt. The Tiv in Benue and Jukun in Taraba have been at war for over 20 years over land. Addressing a press conference in Makurdi, the Benue capital, Ihagh said the soldiers, who backed the Jukun attackers, were from 73 Battalion in Takum in Taraba. Ihagh urged Chief of Army Staff Lt-Gen Tukur Burutai to investigate the alleged complicity of soldiers in the attack.
