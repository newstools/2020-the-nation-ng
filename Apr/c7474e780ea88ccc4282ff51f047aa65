 The Kwara Police Command has warned residents in all the 16 local government areas of the state to desist from walking aimlessly during the lockdown ordered by the State Government. The Command Public Relations Officer, DSP Ajayi Okasanmi, gave the warning in a phone interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ilorin on Wednesday. Okasanmi said the command would not tolerate movement of people in any form, including walking around. He said that the aim of the lockdown was to prevent the spread of Coronavirus pandemic in the society. He said that the state government had put in place a mobile court to try anyone or group of people walking around in any part of the state during the period of lockdown except those exempted from the directives. NAN recalls that the state government had on April 14 restored full-scale lockdown across the state for the rest of the 14 days earlier declared. The review also said the movement of all vehicles are banned except commercial vehicles carrying food items, medications, goods and services. (NAN)
