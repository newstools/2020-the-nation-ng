Controversy over the whereabouts of the index case in Anambra was laid to rest on Sunday with the state government admitting the Coronavirus index case was in one of its isolation centres. Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment C Don Adinuba warned that the state will not tolerate any controversy over the index case He said: “The state has noted with dismay the sudden appearance of propaganda materials against the person purported to be the state’s coronavirus index case. “The materials, including social media broadcasts, began to emerge within 24 hours after the state recorded its index case on Friday, April 10. “The materials are slanderous and violate all known medical ethics. They were obviously made by persons who want to raise a false alarm and create panic everywhere. “The state government has not revealed the name of the index case, nor have the hospital authorities where he is receiving treatment now or has been treated in recent times. “Therefore, the identity revealed on the social media broadcasts is merely speculative. No COVID-19 patient anywhere has received the kind of attention given to Anambra’s index case. Yet, there are about 300 confirmed COVID-19 patients in Nigeria alone.
