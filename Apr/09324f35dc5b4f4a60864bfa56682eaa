 Vice-Chancellor of the Bowen University, Iwo, Osun State, Prof Joshua Ogunwole, has urged Nigerians to be prepared for post-COVID-19 opportunities. Ogunwole made the call while distributing food items to Iwo and Oluponna communities to cushion the effect of the lockdown occasioned by the pandemic on its members. He said: “We all need to be prepared for post-COVID-19 by innovating ideas on how to improve the mode of doing businesses and other socio-economic activities in Nigeria.” The VC said the pandemic had affected many and changed the way of living and doing business therefore requiring changes to the previous order of things.  “This is an indication that the country cannot remain the same.  The entire world will depend more on virtual interaction and a new method of doing business and meetings will evolve, religious organisations now conduct their services through the digital system unlike before. “We have been teaching our students with our smart school hub, video teaching, animation especially with our colleagues in Australia, Italy, and others,” he said. He pleaded with the government at all levels to avoid community transmission of the virus. Speaking on the significance of the welfare package for residents, he said, “As a Christian university, we are our brothers’ keepers this is why we are out to give this welfare package to the people not minding their religious inclination.”
