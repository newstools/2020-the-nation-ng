Determined to contribute a lasting support towards the eradication of Coronavirus pandemic, the Federal Capital City Football Association (FCTFA) chairman  Mohammed Adam Mouktar has hosted a website to create more awareness for the deadly virus. Mouktar who has turned football around in Abuja and its environs, said the website with address: https://coronahelp.ng/ is expected to be one-stop for information dissemination and logistical support for victims of the virus widely referred to as COVID-19, adding he was moved to take this action to stem the tide of the virus following the trauma Nigeria and indeed the world is going through. “Adversity, according to William Arthur Ward, is the first path to truth,” explained Mouktar, the football-mad supporter of Liverpool, the English club famed for its motto-You’ll never walk alone. “Adversity causes some men to break; others to break records. Adversity is sometimes hard upon a man; but for one man who can stand prosperity, there are a hundred that will stand adversity. Always seek out the seed of triumph in every adversity.” He said he was duty-bound because of the enormous challenges being faced by government and international agencies against the spread of COVID-19. He said: “We must rise up in times like these to give contributions in the fight to protect Nigerians and I feel the internet is the most Informative tool we can use to disseminate credible information on the do’s and don’ts of COVID-19 pandemic. Every little help counts! “Government and International agencies are overwhelmed and overstretched and it is our duty of care to be part of this struggle to help save lives. “I Intend for this(https://coronahelp.ng/) to serve beyond this particular pandemic but to serve as a tool going forward to raise awareness, funding, research and development in the fight to save humanity against deadly  diseases,” noted Mouktar.
