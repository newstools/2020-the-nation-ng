Heartland head coach, Fidelis Ilechukwu said there should be no  qualms   if Plateau United are declared  champions in the event that the  20202 league season is not concluded due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Ilechukwu stated that it has been tough time for him with the total lockdown paralysing almost everything but added  it  was advisable to  comply with the directives to stay at home and stay safe. “I will like the league season to continue because we at Heartland believe that we can still turn the corner and improve better than we did,” Ilechukwu began in a chat with NationSport. “We know that we have not performed to our expectations but we believe that anything can still happen regarding the league title. “But we need to be realistic with the reality of things since we do not know when this pandemic will stop.” He was  of the view Plateau United have done just enough to be handed the league title in case the season is inconclusive  since the Audu Maikaba-led side  has shown  consistency in the 25matches played before  the league went into recess due to Covid-19. He explained: “If the Covid-19 pandemic is not contained by the end of May,  it will be difficult for us to end the season with the CAF calendar. It is then proper for Plateau United to be named the league Champions. “They have performed very well in all the games they gave played. They have shown they are consistent enough and are on top of the league table with some points better than second placed, Rivers United. I will not support outright cancellation of the season because Plateau United have shown that they are the best team and the most consistent.” Meanwhile, the former MFM gaffer still admonished his players to ensure they obey the directive to stay at home and ensure that they do not contract the deadly virus.
