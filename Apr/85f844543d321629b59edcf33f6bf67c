 OLYMPIC organisers have warned there is no Plan B should the rearranged Tokyo Games not be able to take place next summer. A state of emergency has been called in Japan’s capital city after a surge in coronavirus cases, and Tokyo 2020 chief Toshiro Muto has admitted he cannot be sure the pandemic will be under control by the event’s new start date of July 2021. International Olympic President Thomas Bach has also revealed that organisers ‘could not manage a postponement beyond next summer at the latest’ — raising fears the Games may be cancelled altogether if coronavirus is still around next year. And speaking on Wednesday, Tokyo 2020 spokesperson Masa Takaya confirmed: ‘We are working towards the new goal. We don’t have a Plan B.’ Meanwhile, Team GB will send the same 15 sailors they originally selected to next summer’s rescheduled Olympics. Following the postponement of Tokyo 2020, the British Olympics Association asked the Royal Yachting Association to consider and confirm its position regarding selections made in October 2019. But sailing chiefs have resisted the option to make any changes, just like British Canoeing did last week when they stuck with the same five athletes they had originally picked.
