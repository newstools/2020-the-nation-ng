 RENOWNED drink brand Heineken has donated €15million to the International Federation of Red Cross relief efforts for the most vulnerable people affected by COVID-19, particularly in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Executive Board Chairman/Chief Executive Officer Jean-François van Boxmeer said: “For over 100 years the Red Cross has worked tirelessly to save lives around the world. “Now more than ever, we want to offer them our support in the work they do to help the most vulnerable beat COVID 19. “Our thoughts are with all those affected by COVID-19 and the people working tirelessly to care for them. “In this unprecedented situation, at Heineken, we have been following from the start of the outbreak three guiding principles: First, the health, safety and trust of our people are of paramount importance. “Second, we do everything we can to safeguard the continuity of our business and appeal of our brands, which includes supporting the business continuity of our customers and suppliers. “And, third, through our local initiatives, we offer our support to the communities who are most impacted by the pandemic.” Heineken said it was scaling up initiatives in support of on-trade customers across markets in all regions and is committed to paying suppliers at agreed payment terms and will support its most vulnerable small and medium-sized suppliers through early payments.
