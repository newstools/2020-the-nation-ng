 Reigning African junior table tennis champion, Azeez Sholanke , alongside national team colleague Jamiu Ayanwale were at their top form over the weekend as they featured in a ‘ Stay Home-Stay Safe’  table tennis-an enlightenment/exhibition game to aid in the campaign of people staying at home in order to combat the coronavirus pandemic. But for the worldwide lockdown caused by the COVID-19, the duo was to represent Nigeria at the African Junior table tennis championship in Antananarivo, Madagascar. They, however,  put on top displays at the programme held at Bakare Jafojo street in Abule Oki area of Iyana-Ipaja where a meagre 15 spectators were on hand to cheer them up in keeping with the social distance rule to curtail the spread of the deadly virus.  The event which was jointly facilitated by Bakare Jafojo residents chairman, Olatubosun Banjo and Chief Olatunde Durosinmi, the Akinrogun of Abule-Oki, had health experts who took time to brief people in the neighbourhood on how the lockdown would work if  the restrictions were adhered to in overcoming the spread and eventually getting rid of the coronavirus. In the Elite Class, Sholanke defeated Ayanwale 4-3 while ageless Segun Tela also had the better of Patience Ojo in Class A. “The impression that the disease is restricted to a particular set of people has now been proven to be wrong and the only way we can escape being a victim of the disease is to adhere to the social distancing  rule, regular washing of hands with soap and water and  using alcohol-based sanitizers,”  noted  the programme coordinator, Lukman Ologunro.
