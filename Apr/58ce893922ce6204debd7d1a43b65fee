Lagos State Commissioner for Health Prof. Akin Abayomi has said COVID-19 tests in approved testing centres in  are free of charge. Abayomi spoke in a statement on Thursday, in reaction to an online report alleging patients pay N30,000 for COVID-19 test at Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) approved centres in Lagos. The commissioner noted that no designated testing centre in the state was allowed to collect money for COVID-19 tests. Abayomi said the Ministry of Health was not aware of any health worker at any testing centre collecting money for COVID-19 test. He cautioned residents to be wary of misleading reports targeted at discrediting frontline health workers working hard to ensure COVID-19 was contained in the state. “I want to assure the public that activities at the Infectious Disease Hospital, Yaba and other approved centres for COVID-19 screening are monitored in accordance with strict guidelines of the Lagos State COVID-19 Response under which no fees are collected for the tests. “Furthermore, we urge Lagos State residents to call 08000CORONA to report any health worker and/or anyone who demands and/or requests fees to conduct COVID-19 tests at any of our designated testing centres,” Abayomi said. The commissioner said any health worker or personnel who indulge in illegal activities would be sanctioned in line with the law and rules guiding their duties.
