Nigeria burly defender Aliyu Abubakar is already looking forward to exciting times with his new club, Shakter Karagandy, whenever the Kazakhstan Premier League (KPL) resumes when Coronavirus must have been terminated. His arrival from Ukrainian side  Olimpik Donesk to Karagandy in March  coincided with the outbreak of the deadly virus and was only played once as  sub in the club’s 1-0 home win against Kairat Almaty. But the 23-year-old  FIFA U-17 World Cup winner said  he was at the ready ahead of the resumption of the league, adding he would  contribute his quota to his new club. “At the moment we are eighth on the KPL  table with just two games played after we  lost and won game before the league was suspended,” the vastly-travelled Abubakar  who has played in Israel, Tunisia, Finland, Georgia and Ukraine before now told NationSport. “But I have only played once as a substitute and I can’t wait for the resumption of the league which was suspended to guide against the spread of Coronavirus.” Like in most suspended leagues all over the world, Abubakar said the club has provided him and his teammate’s regimen to keep them in tip-top shape by the time the KPL resumes. “We have been mostly indoors,” he said. “My teammates and I are working in gym individually to keep shape. Personally, I’m saddened about the effects of Coronavirus around the world and hoping the world heals fast. “I wish those who are affected recovery fast and stronger while my condolences go to people who have lost loved ones. “ I’m  wishing all my fans back home  in Nigeria safety but they should please stay at home; be positive and  they should continue to pray to God Almighty to help us overcome this deadly COVID-19,”added Abubakar who was a strong member of the Golden Eaglets that won the U-17 WC in 2013.
