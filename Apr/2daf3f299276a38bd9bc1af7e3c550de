Managing Director, Anambra Traffic Management Agency (ATMA), Pat Obiefuna has expressed dismay over the spate of disobedience by residents of the state to the stay-at-home directives by the state government. Obiefuna, who stated this on Monday in a chat with the Nation, said he was particularly worried with the number of vehicles on the road, saying such violations were enough to attract extension of the ongoing lockdown. The ATMA boss who was reacting to the purported relaxation of the lockdown following the ugly incident in Nkpor, near Onitsha, said residents were only allowed to restock foodstuffs in their homes as the government was mindful of their plights. He said, “Government didn’t relax the lockdown, but allowed people to go and restock. The point is that people tend to take Government for granted. Vehicles are not supposed to be on the road except those on essential duties. “Our Governor is a compassionate governor. He just purposely allowed them to restock so the full enforcement can commence. The order will soon be restored. “People seem to be lackadaisical about the lockdown, but we’re here to enforce it by ensuring that those who are not supposed to be on the road are not there. “Our problem is disobedience. If we obey instructions, the lockdown may be eased off before the slated time, but because we don’t obey, there’s every likelihood it be extended. But we pray it doesn’t.”
