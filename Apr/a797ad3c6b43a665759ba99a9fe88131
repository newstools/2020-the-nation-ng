A comedian, Igbinigie Uwaila, who goes by the stage name ‘Mc talk and do’, has cried out that he is losing his mind as he does not make money again due to the outbreak of COVID-19. Uwaila said he feared to spend all he had saved if the lockdown caused by COVID-19 continues as he relies on weekly shows to make money. Speaking in a chat with some journalists in Akure, Uwaila said he had to break silence on the suffering he and other comedians are currently facing. Uwaila said he was supposed to be in Italy to entertain guests at a wedding on May 2nd but the wedding was canceled because of COVID-19. He said he abandoned his Accounting certificate to pursue a career in the comedy business because he loved to make people laugh. According to him: “I have lost so much since this COVID-19 started. Before now, every week the least money I make is N100,000. Sometimes I make N150,000. The situation now is bad and we don’t know how long it will take. “The impact of coronavirus on our business is huge. On May 2nd, I was supposed to anchor a marriage event in Napoleon in Italy but because of this COVID-19 pandemic, the marriage has been put on hold. “I was supposed to start the process of procuring visa but COVID-19 stopped it.and that would have been my first time of taking my craft outside the country. It was to be an avenue to tap into the reservoir of my creativity. “I chose comedy as my career because I discovered I have always been funny. I enjoy making people laugh and I love to take comedy to the next level in my life and I understand that comedy is more than having a good sense of humor. “It requires perseverance, long hours, good writing skills, and curiosity about the world.”
