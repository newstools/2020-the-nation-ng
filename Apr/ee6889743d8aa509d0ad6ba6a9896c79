 Nollywood actor, Kingsley Ogbonna aka Dauda, who is studying law has said that he doesn’t get preferential treatment on campus where he’s studying law. Dauda said he gets the same treatment every other law student gets on the campus as he strives to get a degree in law. “Law is not something you study from a distance. You must be there. You must be in school. We do group work regularly and at times you do your work. They don’t look at you because you are a star or Dauda or an elderly person, no, they treat you the way they treat other students. It is not a joke,” he said. The humour merchant went on to disclose that this has affected his appearance in movies as well as the chances of getting movie roles. “I seldom act. You see me on screen once-in-a-while because I don’t really have that time again. Normally, I would take a script and spend 10 days on set but if I take a script now and have to write a test in school, you know I’m a lawyer in equity. “At times you are given a movie script and you are expected to be on set maybe on a Monday and that Monday you have a test. You ask them to give you till Wednesday, they refuse. I return their script and money,” says Dauda. The actor, who also performs the role of the Abia state governor’s special adviser on Arts, Culture, and Tourism for over four years says aside studying to get a degree in law, politics has also taken most of his time. He disclosed that he will return to full time acting after securing a degree in law but won’t be dropping his political toga.
