 DESPITE the announcement of the leadership of the House of Representatives that members will donate two months’ salaries to the campaign against COVID-19 pandemic, some Reps are opposed to it. Those leading the revolt in the House are two members from the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and a Rep from the All Progressives Congress (APC). Although they are querying compulsory deduction of their basic salaries without their consent, findings confirmed that the affected members have been nursing personal grudges against Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila. One of the aggrieved lawmakers was said to be weighed down by marital responsibility, especially managing three wives and 14 children. The lawmaker, who just acquired a pretty wife, could not fathom why the cash for honeymoon will go for the fight against COVID-19! The three lawmakers’ campaign has, however, hit brick walls because most members of the House of Representatives have rejected their anti-donation revolt. But unknown to the three lawmakers, the Speaker consulted all principal officers, zonal and state caucus leaders before announcing the donation of March and April salaries of the House members. Whether the aggrieved lawmakers like it or not, the leadership decision remains binding. The deduction of the basic salaries will now be in April and May respectively.
