But there was no welfare package for Nigerians” Uduak Faith,  a worker in Mumbai, said while thanking  the  Nigerian community leaders for coming to her aid.  President of All Nigerian Students and Community Association in India, Comrade Solomon Itere said: ““Our association, facilitated by the Nigerian ambassador to India, Chris Eze Maj Gen Rtd, ensured that all Nigerians  in deportation camps got stimulus  and  preventive packages to ensure that they were safe. I commend  the Nigerian Embassy and the Nigerian community for their intervention to cushion effects of Coronavirus in India on our people.
