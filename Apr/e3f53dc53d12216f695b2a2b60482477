Africa’s leading cement giant, BUA Cement has donated relief materials worth millions of naira to its host communities in Edo State in support of COVID-19 pandemic. The relief materials to its host communities in Edo included 350 bags of rice and 22,500 facemasks whilst the company also promised to deliver hand sanitizers in coming days. These items were donated to Okpella, Okpekpe, Ibie and Elele Communities. The Managing Director/CEO, BUA Cement plc, Yusuf Binji, said the relief materials would help reduce the spread of the virus and also provide a much needed supply of staple items during the period.

We believe this donation will go a long way to ameliorate the negative effect of the lockdown.” Representing the BUA Cement CEO at the handover, Richard Gidado, a General Manager at the company’s BUA Cement plant, Obu Okpella, stated that the donation was aimed at complementing the effort of the government to ameliorate the negative effects of the lockdown.
