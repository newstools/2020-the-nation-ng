Ijaw youths have called for a global attention to massive pollution of rivers crisscrossing communities in Bonny, Forcados and other settlements in the Niger Delta region. A delegation of the youths, led by the interim President of the Ijaw Youths Council (IYC), Worldwide, Kennedy Olorogun, toured the affected communities in Rivers, Bayelsa and Delta states and were shocked by the magnitude of contamination. The delegation, in a report signed by Olorogun and Secretary of Council, Frank Akiefa, found thousands of fish killed by the pollutants and washed ashore the river banks, which were emitting foul smell. Olorogun said: “If you go to Bonny now and see for yourself; you will be amazed at the extent of destruction that had taken place. You will see dead fishes floating on top of the river. Fishermen in the area can longer go to fishing and you know the times we are in; in this season of Coronavirus, you can better imagine what the people in these areas are going through.”
