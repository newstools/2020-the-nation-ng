Former Jigawa Governor Sule Lamido on Thursday morning announced that he has tested negative for COVID-19. Lamido, who took to his verified Facebook page to break the news, said his Police orderly and the driver also tested negative. The PDP chieftain wrote: “Dr Imam Wada Bello called at 5:35pm 15/4/2020 and informed me that they are through with our sample tests and our results, that is myself, driver and Orderly thankfully are ALL NEGATIVE and that he will send me the details later tonight.” The two terms former governor said: “We have spoken now 11:46pm 15/4/2020 that the results will be sent in the morning.” Lamido,  a die-hard student of Malam Aminu Kano School politics, said: “I still do not know how to react to the professionalism of Dr Bello and his team or to the hundreds messages of prayers and goodwill on my Facebook wall or to over a thousand text messages of prayers on my MTN number from across all religious, tribal, regional, political, racial or any divide! Only Allah the most merciful most benevolent can make this happen!” The Talakawa crusader stated: “For now or any time I do not have the language, in art or mastery to convey to each and every one the depth of my feelings or emotions or gratitude.”
