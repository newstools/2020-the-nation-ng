Super Eagles midfielder Ifeanyi Mathew’s contract at Lillestrom will run out in July and the midfielder has admitted he may now be forced to extend his stay at the Norwegian club, who will play in the second division whenever the new season begins, reports scorenigeria.com.ng. “For me who does not have a contract after the summer, it is difficult. No clubs can see me, and right now I don’t know much about what happens after August 1,” Mathew reportedly said. “I do not have a contract with any other club, and such is the situation now, there is also a possibility that I want to extend the agreement with Lillestrom. “At least that’s something I would consider as long as we don’t get to play matches.” Lillestrom sports director Simon Mesfin said they plan to talk with the player. “We will talk with him and his agent and hear what they have to say,” he said. Matthew, 23 who star for the Super Eagles under coach Sunday Oliseh, has twice turned down a chance to join Rosenberg, insisting he wishes to play outside Norway. He posted a short loan spell at Turkish club Osmanlispor last year.
