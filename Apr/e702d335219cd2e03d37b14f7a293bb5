 ALL Progressives Congress (APC) National Chairman Adams Oshiomhole yesterday said President Muhammadu Buhari lost a dependable lieutenant and a close ideological disciple in his Chief of Staff, the late Abba Kyari. He said the late Kyari fought for the downtrodden and conscientiously pursued the common good without seeking personal glory. Oshiomhole recalled his encounter with Kyari in 1973 in their days at the Zamfara Textile in Kaduna. He said: “We had found ourselves in opposing sides of the isle at Zamfara Textile in Kaduna. I was the leader of the workers union while he represented the management as Admin Officer. “But in the many brushes the union had with the management, Abba Kyari showed a true character as a conscientious man, a true Nigerian patriot. by never failing to side with workers on the core issues of human dignity and fairness. “Following our protest, he was the lone voice at the management meeting who spoke against the operation of two classes of the canteen by the company. “He was not afraid to state that having a uniform canteen for both management staff and junior workers was the only way to convince the junior workers that their meal was not inferior.” Oshiomhole said in pushing the workers’ case with management, Kyari never sought to be seen or worshipped as a “hero” but saw social justice advocacy as a duty. “Indeed, those who knew him would never begrudge him; those who resented him had never the chance of truly knowing him,” he said.
