The Lagos State government has refuted the report that its warehouse was vandalised in Abule Egba and relief packages looted, as claimed by an online video. A statement issued on Wednesday from the Ministry of Agriculture explained that the allegation is totally false, as the state government does not have any storage facility located in Abule-Egba. The statement urged members of the public to disregard the video and allegation completely.
