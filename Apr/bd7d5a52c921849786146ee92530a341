The General Overseer of The Redeemed Christian Church of God worldwide, Pastor Enoch  Adeboye, has donated N20 million to the Osun State government to aid the fight against coronavirus in the State. Earlier in the week, Government had named the clergy as a member of its 21-man Food and Relief Committee saddled with the responsibility of fashioning out how to cushion the effect of the lockdown on its citizens. According to a Facebook post on his official Facebook page, Pastor E. A. Adeboye, noted that the donation was a token to support the State Government in the fight against COVID-19. He added: “We have been called to be salt and light to the earth, and the first place that should benefit from the sweetness and illumination is home, this is why I’m supporting @osunstategovt in the fight against COVID-19 with the sum of 20 Million Naira. “I know this might not fully cater for all areas but this is my token. We will continue to support as many people as we can this period with foodstuff, safety gears, sanitisers and whatever is essential through our CSR arm”, he added.
