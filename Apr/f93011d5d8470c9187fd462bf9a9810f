 Japan is poised to declare a state of emergency in Tokyo and six other regions in an attempt to stem the march of the coronavirus. “We hope to declare a state of emergency… after listening to the opinions of the advisory panel,” Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters. “We are seeing rapid increases of new infections, particularly in urban areas such as Tokyo and Osaka. “Considering that medical institutions are facing a critical situation, I have received opinions that the government should prepare to declare a state of emergency.” Abe had previously shown reluctance to impose such a measure but he changed his mind after seeing the surge of Covid-19 infections in metropolitan areas, says Japan Times. He held talks with key ministers before making his announcement. (Newsnow)
