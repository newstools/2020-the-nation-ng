 A total lockdown of parts of Port Harcourt and it’s environs came into effect on Sunday as part of the River State Government efforts to ensure compliance with social distancing rule to prevent spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The total lockdown, which was announced during a live television briefing by the Governor on Friday, came into effect 06:00am on Sunday. The affected areas are local business hubs where streets are overflowing with traders such as Creek road, including Prison junction, Nembe waterside, Cultural Centre, Yam Zone and Ahoada Street.” The lockdown also include the bustling and densely populated Diobu areas, including education bus stop, Kalabari by Odi Street, Afikpo Street, Gambia Street, the entire Ikoku Spare part zone, Rivers State University roundabout, and Abali Park under the flyover (both descending and ascending) at Mile 1 and Isaac Boro park.  The Governor warned the same steps will be taken against parts of Obio/Akpor Local Government Area, if the continue to violate the State Government’s directive. He said: “We have also noticed that stores and remote spaces are being converted to mini-markets in Obio/Akpor Local government Area by unscrupulous persons in defiance of the ban on market activities in the State. “This should stop immediately, otherwise, we shall be compelled to lockdown the entire Local Government Area and deal with those flouting our directives and undermining our efforts.” He regretted that commercial bus and taxi operators in the state are crowding their vehicles with passengers in disregard of the order on social distancing. The Governor said: “This is as dangerous and unacceptable. The State Government will in the next few days take appropriate actions against all transporters should they fail to immediately enforce social distancing practices and the mandatory use of sanitizers and face masks in their operations.”
