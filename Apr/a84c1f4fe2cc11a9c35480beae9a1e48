 NASARAWA State is gong extra hard in containing the spread of the dreaded COVID-19 because the state lacks capacity to manage large positive incidences, Governor Abdullahi Sule said yesterday. Sule made this known while being presented with a report on oversight functions of all Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) carried out by the Nasarawa State Civil Service Commission, at the Government House. He expressed concern that a widespread coronavirus infection will have devastating effect on both the economy and health of the state especially that the State is one of the least in terms of federal allocation. Sule used the opportunity to therefore, appeal to residents of the state to bear with the decisions being taking by his administration in a bid to protect them against the pandemic. He assured that government will do everything possible, to ensure that the effects of such decisions, are not so devastating to the people of the state, and appealed to them to bear with government until the prevailing challenge is over. “Truly speaking, I am worried about the impact COVID-19 could have on the health and economy of our state. “The state will be badly hit, especially economically, and also in the area of health, once we discover that we have positive cases in Nasarawa State,” the governor said. “I know decisions we are taking are painful to the people, especially at a time we just went through the Easter period and we are also approaching the Ramadan.
