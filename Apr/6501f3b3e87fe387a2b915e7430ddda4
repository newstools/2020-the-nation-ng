Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Kwara Command, has intercepted seven fully- loaded commercial vehicles in Ilorin, for violating the lockdown restriction by the state government. Spokesman Ayeni Olasunkanmi, speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ilorin yesterday, said the vehicles were coming from Lagos, to stop in Ilorin. He said that the vehicles were stopped as they were about to enter Ilorin, adding that the drivers and passengers were arrested for violating the stay-at-home restriction by the government. Olasunkanmi said that NSCDC operatives took the arrested persons to Sango Magistrates’ Court, Ilorin. He said the security operatives had intercepted commercial and private vehicles since the beginning of the lockdown. He said that those arrested had been handed over to the appropriate authorities for prosecution. “Most of the vehicles moving around town during this lockdown are those allowed by the government, such as the medical personnel, farmers, journalists and others, but they are identified by their identity cards, “ Olasunkanmi said. He said that NSCDC had deployed 250 personnel, drawn from Crisis Management Department, Medical Unit and Operation Department to curtail the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. NAN reports that Kwara State Government had prohibited vehicular movements of any kind, during the lockdown, except those on essential duties and trucks conveying food items and drugs and associated services earlier exempted. The government ordered the restriction of movement to stop the spread of COVID- 19, and warned that anyone caught violating the regulations would be prosecuted in mobile courts and sanctioned.
