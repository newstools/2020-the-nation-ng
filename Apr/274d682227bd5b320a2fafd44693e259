 THE Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has urged the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 to account for the N5 billion President Muhammadu Buhari released as special intervention fund to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). In a statement yesterday in Abuja by its spokesman Kola Ologbondiyan, the party said its demand was predicated on alleged secrecy in the handling of the said funds. It also alleged unnecessary administrative bottlenecks and unwarranted political control, saying these were impeding the smooth running of the agencyâ€™s activities. The party expressed worry about the recent complaints by the NCDC that it needed essential COVID-19 extraction kits to tackle the pandemic and safeguard Nigerians.
