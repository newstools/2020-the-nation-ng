Osagie Otabor, Akure  A former Nollywood actress, Ms Grace Agbo, has said that she left Nollywood to pick up a fire fighting job because of her desire to always help those in danger. Agbo, who hails from Idoma in Okpokwu Local Government Area of Benue State, said she has found fulfillment since she started working in the Federal Fire Service, Abuja. Speaking in a chat with our reporter in Akure, Ondo State capital, Agbo said she featured in several movies like Black Out, Mr Potosky, Lost Pride, Deadly Desire, Palace of Sorrow, Ada-Ide-Ichaka, Haunted Palace, Village Don, The Calabash amongst others. Agbo however explained that she took a break from acting to enable her focus on her passion in firefighting. According to her, “I like this new job. I have always wanted a uniform job but I will miss Nollywood greatly because acting has also been my passion right from childhood. “My family especially my dad is very happy with my new job. What people are saying that I left Nollywood because of poor pay is not true. I didn’t leave Nollywood totally. I am just taking a break for now to enable me focus on my new job. “I love my uniform job and I also enjoy saving people in danger. It feels really good; it gives me joy knowing that I can be of service to my country.” “My colleagues in Nollywood should keep up with making good movies and let the shows go on but the big problem there is funding, lack of government presence and no enough opportunity for upcoming actors.”
