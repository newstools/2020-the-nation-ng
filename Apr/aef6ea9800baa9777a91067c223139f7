 NIGERIA national team vice-captain William Troost-Ekong revealed he told Heracles centre-forward Cyriel Dessers to take his Super Eagles invitation with both hands. The Belgian-born striker was handed his first call-up to the Super Eagles for their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying game against Sierra Leone after pledging his allegiance to the side. The match was scheduled to take place last month but the spread of coronavirus to Africa led to the postponement of the match. Troost-Ekong, who now has 42 caps for Nigeria, was born in the Netherlands and has played for their youth team before switching to the West Africans in 2015. He explained how he encouraged Dessers to accept the invitation to the Super Eagles but warned there is stiff competition in his position, with captain Ahmed Musa, Victor Osimhen, Kelechi Iheanacho and Paul Onuachu doing well. “I spoke with Cyriel Dessers before his call up. He asked me questions about being part of the team,” Troost-Ekong told the Super Eagles media team in an Instagram chat.
