There will be no military roadblocks within Lagos and Ogun states except when necessary, the Nigerian Army said on Tuesday. General Officer Commanding (GOC) 81 Division, Maj.-Gen. Olu Irefin, told our correspondent that the Army was on standby. He said the police and other civilian law enforcement agencies will enforce the lockdown, adding that the military will only intervene where the need arises. Irefin said: “The military will only come out if it becomes necessary and on instructions from higher headquarters. There will be no roadblock by the military. The police will be the lead agency and the military will only come out to support if necessary.” Meanwhile, the Nigerian Navy (NN) said only ships that have stayed in the sea for 14 days upwards and whose crew members are free of the COVID-19 symptoms will be allowed into the harbour. “Such ships are also required to have thermal sensing equipment/device to detect abnormal temperature readings when personnel are scanned,” he added. Flag Officer Commanding (FOC) Naval Training Command, Admiral Oladele Bamidele Daji, said the command sent representatives to the multi-agency task force led by the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA).
