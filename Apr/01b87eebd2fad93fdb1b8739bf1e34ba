 The Police in Ogun have vowed to clamp down on those who may take advantage of the COVID-19 lockdown to perpetrate crime in the state. DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Ogun, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ota, Ogun, on Monday that the command would stop at nothing to ensure that it clamped down on criminals. He warned criminals to desist from any evil act capable of causing further tension in the state or face the `full wrath of the law’. NAN reports that the state government had announced a lockdown of the state beginning from April 3, following the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic. Oyeyemi said that police patrol teams would be at strategic locations around the state to ensure full enforcement of the lockdown order. “The police will also embark on stop-and-search operations to prevent criminals from carrying out their nefarious activities. “We are using this opportunity to warn against criminal activities and other forms of unlawfulness. Anybody found culpable will be prosecuted,” he said. The police spokesman assured residents of the state of the command’s readiness and commitment to ensure the protection of lives and property during the period. He urged the Ogun people to adhere strictly to all directives aimed at curtailing the spread of COVID-19 in the state. (NAN)
