Former Nigeria international Henry Nwosu has picked John Obi Mikel as the greatest Nigerian player in the Premier League ever, reports  goal.com. The midfielder joined Chelsea in the summer of 2006 after the Blues resolved their transfer dispute with rivals Manchester United, who had previously announced the signing of the then 18-year-old. Since making his debut for the Blues under Jose Mourinho, Mikel went on to spend 11 years with the side, winning the Champions League, Europa League, two Premier League titles, three FA Cup trophies, one League Cup and Community Shield diadem. “Mikel is ahead of them. He was consistent during his time. He performed so well for Chelsea,” stated the former Super Eagles midfielder. “He is a team player and a force to be reckoned with when it comes to the Premier League considering his achievements. He won many trophies.” Nwankwo Kanu is another notable Nigerian who played in the English top-flight. The lanky forward arrived in England in 1993 joining Arsenal from Ajax. He spent three years with the Gunners, helping the side to win two Premier League titles, two FA Cup trophies and one Community Shield. Kanu left the Emirates Stadium to team up with West Bromwich Albion before joining Portsmouth, where he won the FA Cup. “Kanu did not perform as well as Mikel. We are not talking about individual play here but Kanu did his best,” he added. Nwosu spent his career in Africa, playing for New Nigeria Bank, African Continental Bank of Lagos, ASEC Mimosas of Cote d’Ivoire and Racing Bafoussam of Cameroon. He had 60 caps for the Super Eagles, scoring eight goals and was a member of the Nigeria squad that won the 1980 Africa Cup of Nations. He also played at the 1982, 1984 and 1988 AFCON tournaments.
