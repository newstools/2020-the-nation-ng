A non-governmental organization, Partners for Community Safety (PCS) has called on Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to set up a standard medical laboratory in line with international best practices for COVID-19 sample collection and testing in Kano state. A statement by the team lead, PSC, Comrade Ali Wali, decried the body language and way NCDC is handling the COVID-19 pandemic in Kano. Wali also called on the federal government to quickly set up testing centres across the state and ”embark on community testing before things get out of hands.” The statement reads in part: “Kano state testing capacity needs to enhanced urgently, this is because the status of the state as far as COVID-19 is concerned is not yet known. Older people and people with underlying medical problems are dying in Kano. “With a population of about 18 million people, only a few testing kits were given to the state. This is sad.” He called on the members of the public to be serious about COVID-19 and stop spreading fake news because it is a reality everyone must face. He also called on the security agencies to collaborate with traditional institutions in order to strengthen surveillance on the nation’s borders to avert interstate transmission.
