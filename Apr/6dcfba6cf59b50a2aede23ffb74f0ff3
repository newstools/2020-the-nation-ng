A Magistrate court in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital, has remanded a police sergeant who shot and killed a policewoman last week. Sergeant Bitrus Osaiah, attached to a task force on illegal trading and road decongestion, was said to have shot Sergeant Lovenda Elekwachi who was on traffic control duty. Elekwachi was shot in the head when she reportedly intervened in a face-off between the task force and a resident who flouted the lockdown order. Osaiah has been dismissed by the police. Meanwhile, family of the deceased has criticised Governor Nyesom Wike for what they called his silence on the matter. Commissioner of Police Joseph Mukan has visited Elekwachi’s family to condole with them. Joseph Amaechi, who spoke on behalf of the family, said Wike has refused to condemn Osaiah’s  action. Amaechi said, “Our family is not happy with what has happened to us, but the coming of the CP here today has somehow assuaged our pain.” Magistrate Ipalibo Iyabo did not take Osaiah’s plea. The suspect was remanded and the case adjourned till May 26.
