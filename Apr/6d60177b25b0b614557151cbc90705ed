A former member of the House of Representatives, who represented Badagry Federal Constituency, Mr. Joseph Bamgbose, on Tuesday donated 2,000 food items to Badagry residents. Bamgbose said it is important that everyone gets involved in the fight against coronavirus, irrespective of social status, political party or religious sect. He said: “Except you are not human or you don’t have human feelings, you can’t claim ignorance of what is happening. “We can see from the records how coronavirus has eaten deep into the nation and has affected homes. “My aim is to pay back to my community once again as part of my contributions to support the government. “I packaged three items for the people; rice, garri and fresh fish.”
