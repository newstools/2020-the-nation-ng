 Primary and secondary school pupils will soon begin receiving lessons online until the coronavirus spread is fully contained and schools safe to reopen, the Federal Government has said. The government said it had been planning online lessons for pupils even before the outbreak of the pandemic in China last December. Education Minister, Adamu Adamu stated these while responding to questions during the daily briefing of the Presidential Task Force on COVID – 19 in Abuja. The government had on March 19 closed the 104 unity schools and  directed the closure of tertiary institutions for a month. Adamu said the ministry was working with the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) and the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN) to deliver lessons to pupils in their homes.  He said some tertiary institutions, particularly private-owned, had commenced online lectures for their pupils. The minister said: “Yes, the ministry has been planning even before COVID-19, only that few people knew about it. “Some tertiary institutions have already been giving their lessons online and the ministry is working with the Nigerian Television Authority and the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria to begin giving lectures not just because of COVID-19. “I hope this will become a permanent feature of our educational system. So lessons will be given online. “Last time I met with the Vice-Chancellors and the education family, I even talked to the press and told them (reporters) that I have directed institutions of higher learning to start thinking of giving lessons where they are. “I am already aware that there are some private institutions – two or three – that have come to my knowledge who are already giving lessons online.”
