 FORMER Anambra State Governor Peter Obi has urged governments to be cautious in the relaxation of the lockdown order in some states. In a statement by his media aide, Mr. Valentine Obienyem, the ex-governor noted that “easing the lockdown in some parts of the country at this stage is not advisable”. The statement reads: “Let me generally appeal that from all advice, locally and internationally, easing the lockdown in any part of the country should be done with extreme caution at this stage. “As a country, we have not been able to carry out reasonable number of tests to ascertain the real COVID-19 situation in the country. “We have only, so far, conducted less than 10,000 tests when our contemporaries in Africa have done a lot more.” Obi, who had urged the Federal Government to set up COVID-19 testing centres in every state, reiterated the importance of every state having at least one testing centre to speed up the testing process.
