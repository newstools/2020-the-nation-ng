Unilever Nigeria had witnessed a general decline in performance in 2019 as the company struggled with sluggish market and declining margins.

The company recorded a loss after tax of N7.42 billion in 2019 as against net profit of N10.55 billion in 2018. The company attributed the decline in performance to challenging operating conditions and its corporate decision to tighten credit terms to address exposure from trade receivables and excess stock in trade in order to position for innovation and a return to competitive growth.
