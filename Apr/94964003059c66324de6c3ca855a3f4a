 The Ahmadiyya Muslim Jama’at Nigeria under the auspices of its global humanitarian group, Humanity First International Nigeria, has given out food items to feed 500 families in Lagos and 300 in Kano as well as members of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) in Lagos State. The donations were done separately at the Ahmadiyya Islamic Organisation headquarters in Ojokoro, Lagos and Kano. The gesture was part of the group’s economic palliative measures to tackle the economic hardship created by the COVID-19 pandemic. NUJ Lagos Council Chairman Dr. Qasim Akinreti received 10 bags of rice and beans as well as 100 nose masks on behalf of the union. Ahmadiyya Muslim Jama’at Nigeria Amir (National Head), Alatoye Folorunso, enjoined Nigerians to be law-abiding, obey the stay at home directives and implement other precautionary measures ordered by the government and health authorities to halt the spread of the pandemic.  Represented by Naib Amir (Deputy National Head) and Finance Administration Alhaji Mufadhil Bankole, Folorunso said the provision of palliatives to the needy should be the social responsibility of the government at all levels as well as well-meaning Nigerians. He said food items and face masks given to the NUJ was in recognition of the tremendous work of the media in sensitising and enlightening the public on the pandemic. Bankole said local branches of the group across the country had provided food items and relief materials to the vulnerable at the grassroots. He promised that other states such as Ogun, Osun, Oyo and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) would benefit from another round of donations of the food items.
