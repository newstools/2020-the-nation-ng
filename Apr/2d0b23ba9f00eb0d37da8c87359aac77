 KANO State where COVID-19 cases are rising at an alarming rate has been put under immediate total lockdown for two weeks by President Muhammadu Buhari. In the last two weeks, the state’s virus infection cases rose to 77 as at Sunday. Besides, there have been many deaths from “strange ailment” amid fears that they might not be unconnected with coronavirus. The President said in his broadcast: “As we continue to streamline our response in the centres of Lagos and the FCT, I am gravely concerned about the unfortunate developments in Kano in recent days.” He added: “I have directed the enforcement of a total lockdown for a period of two weeks effective immediately. The Federal Government shall deploy all the necessary human, material and technical resources to support the state in controlling and containing the pandemic and preventing the risk of further spread to neighbouring states.” The President said “although an in-depth investigation is still on-going, we have decided to deploy additional Federal Government manpower, material and technical resources to strengthen and support the State Government’s efforts, with immediate effect. “In Kano, and indeed many other states that are recording new cases, preliminary findings show that such cases are mostly from interstate travel and emerging community transmission. “Drawing from these, I implore all Nigerians to continue to adhere strictly to the advisories published by the Presidential Task Force and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control.”
