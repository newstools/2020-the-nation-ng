 THE Federal Government has offered to insure all the frontline health workers battling to keep Nigerians safe from the Coronavirus pandemic. The Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, said in Abuja that “adequate insurance, adequate compensation and support during and in the aftermath of the COVID 19 pandemic will be offered frontline health workers. “Health workers are always at the front line of any outbreak response, and, as such, are exposed to hazards that put them at risk of infection with an outbreak pathogen (in this case COVID-19). “The hazards they will be insured against include pathogen exposure, long working hours, psychological distress, fatigue, occupational burnout, stigma, and physical and psychological violence. “Also to be considered for COVID 19 insurance are senior government officials who also are going round to ensure things are in order and may be exposed to the virus.” Ahmed, who thanked the health workers, said that the government “will be engaging with the insurance industry to package special health care insurance, which is life insurance for health care workers.”
