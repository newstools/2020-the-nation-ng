 A NEW study on Coronavirus indicates that  sufferers can spread the infection 13 feet (3.9m), twice the popular 6ft (1.75m)  social distancing. Chinese scientists found, while examining surface and air samples from an intensive care unit and a general Covid-19 ward in Wuhan, that virus-laden aerosols were mainly concentrated downstream from patients at up to 13 feet. The team observed that aerosol transmission – when the droplets of the virus are so fine they become suspended and remain airborne for several hours. This differs from cough or sneeze droplets that fall to the ground within seconds and linger on surfaces. The Chinese team, from the Academy of Military Sciences in Beijing, also tested the concentration of the disease on surfaces. Their findings, published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, were that the virus was most heavily concentrated on the floors of the wards, ‘perhaps because of gravity and air flow causing most virus droplets to float to the ground.’ High levels were also found on frequently touched surfaces like computer mice, trashcans, bed rails and door knobs.
