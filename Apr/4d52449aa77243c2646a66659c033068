From Osagie Otabor, Akure  Isiaka Yinusa, the driver of the truck that exploded last Saturday at Eleyewo in Akure North Local Government Area of Ondo State, has said he did not know that he was carrying explosives. Yinusa is still recuperating from the surgery he undergone to remove shrapnels from his stomach, as he was taken to hospital unconscious. He said the last thing he heard was ‘everybody run’ before he became unconscious and woke up at hospital. Speaking in an interview monitored on the state television, Yinusa said his boss contacted him to move some items from a stranded truck at Osu along Ife-Ibadan expressway. He said they loaded the consignment and he was to deliver them to a company in Auchi, the headquarters of Etsako West Local Government Area of Edo State.  The driver said that there was a police escort team and an official of the company where the explosives were to be delivered. He said that when they got to Shasha market in Akure and the vehicle became faulty, they passed the night there. Yinusa said he was sleeping inside the truck when one of the police escort told him that they should quickly leave the area because of the population, as smoke was emitting from the truck. Said he: “I was sleeping inside the truck. I heard a bang on the door that smoke was coming out under the vehicle.” “We quickly moved. The policeman that led the team said we should move ahead. As we were moving, the other policemen in the escort started flashing him that he should stop. As we got down, I saw fire emanating from the vehicle. We brought out a fire extinguisher.” “Other drivers parked. They tried to assist. Suddenly the policemen shouted ‘everybody run, everybody run’. As I was running, I heard a bang and noticed something in my abdomen. That was all I could remember. I later woke up in hospital.”
