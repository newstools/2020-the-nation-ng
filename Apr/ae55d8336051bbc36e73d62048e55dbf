The Lagos State Government has declared it needs foreign assistance in the form of molecular biologists and logisticians to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, even if they have to come from China. Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi, stated this at a briefing on Monday. He said there was nothing wrong soliciting the help of China to help curb coronavirus in Nigeria. According to him: “It is not a Nigeria COVID-19 outbreak but a global pandemic. There is need for all nations to collaborate, experts from China went to Europe to assist Italy and Spain, these are well developed countries. “We are running short of molecular biologists, we will not mind receiving assistance from any country that can give us human resource capacity. Experienced molecular biologists is trained not less than 4 years. “I am not aware that we are inviting any doctors from abroad to come and assist us, we are only interested in scientists and molecular biologists and logisticians because 70 percent of response to COVID-19 is logistics.” Abayomi appealed to Lagos residents to stop making hoax calls to the coronavirus lines, revealing that about 31,040 calls to report suspected and real cases on the dedicated lines to alert on coronavirus had been fake. According to him, only nine per cent of the total calls (3610) were valid. Abayomi revealed that of the 87 active cases under its care, only two patients required oxygen with none needing ventilation. He also said if not for proactive efforts from the state government, which made it to put up strategy that included case identification, isolation, contact tracing and community ownership, the positive cases in Lagos would have gone up to 40,000.
