The National Union of Adamawa State Students (NUADSS) has threatened to sue the Dangote Group of Companies over the killing of its member by one of the group’s truck drivers. The NUADSS member, Kamaluddeen Hussain, a final year student of the Modibbo Adama University of Technology (MAUTECH), Yola, had been hit and killed by a Dangote truck last month, March 3, as he was coming out through one of the gates of the university in Girei after an evening prayer at a mosque on the campus. Addressing a press briefing on the matter, President of NUADSS, Comrade Gaddafi Hussaini, said the truck driver had run off, and that the Dangote Group has done nothing since then to empathize with the bereaved family. The student body gave the Dangote Group seven days “to take responsibility for the action of their reckless driver and compensate the family of the deceased” or faces a law suit. Recounting the whole incident from the beginning, the NUADSS President said, “In the morning of March 4th, 2020, we buried a dear colleague and friend, Kamaluddeen Hussaini of Management Technology, MAUTECH, Yola. “He had been killed the previous evening by a reckless driver behind the wheel of a Dangote truck. Witnesses confirmed that the man was over speeding when he lost control and headed for the far roadside where Kamaluddeen and a few others were standing and ran over them. Kamaluddeen gave up the ghost instantly.” The NUADSS president said his union noted that since then no representative of the Dangote Group paid a condolence visit to the family of the deceased, let alone compensate the family. “We at NUADSS express our profound dissatisfaction at their negligence,” he said, urging human rights organisations to join NUADSS in getting justice for Kamaluddeen.
