The Anambra State Government on Wednesday said it had started the teaching of eight subjects on radio to help SS-3 students prepare for their Senior Secondary Certificate Examination (SSCE). The State Commissioner for Basic Education, Prof. Kate Omenugha told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Awka, that the programme tagged “Anambra Teaching On Air”, would ensure that students were engaged during the school closure. It would be recalled that public and private primary and secondary schools had been shut down in Anambra from March 23, as a precautionary measure against the spread of Covid-19. Omenugha said teachers who specialised in core subjects such as Mathematics, English Language, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Economics, Literature-in-English and Financial Accounting, would take the various topics on radio in line with already prepared time table. She said though the tutorials were targeted at the SS-3 students preparing for their SSCE, but SS-1 and SS-2 students could also benefit from it. “The on- air teaching programme, which started today, April 1, on ABS radio, is basically for SS-3 students, who are preparing for SSCE but because SS-3 class is usually for revision, those in SS-1 and SS-2 can also benefit. “To tell the truth, I don’t know how long this sit-at-home directive will last. So, the on-air teaching programme will go on as long as we are at home. The teaching starts from 11.00 a.m to 1.00 p.m everyday. “We already prepared eight subjects for the programme, but we can still add more as time goes on, ” Omenugha said. The Commissioner urged parents to ensure their children listened to the programme rather than allow them patronise tutorial centres, to curb the spread of coronavirus.  (NAN)
