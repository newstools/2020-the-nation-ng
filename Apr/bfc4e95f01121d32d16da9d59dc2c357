An upcoming music act, SIL, has released his first single on the Nigerian entertainment scene. SIL’s debut single is entitled ‘Body’. The less than four minutes single was written by the musician and produced by Kingpin. According to SIL, ‘Body’ is a song he sang to express his appreciation for the beauty and physique of African women. “African women are gorgeous. You can see it in her appearance, how she carries herself and her sexiness. I just love our women and singing about their qualities in my first work is the way to go for me,” he said. SIL plans to release another single in a few weeks, but he doesn’t want to do it alone then. “I plan to collaborate with one of our hottest in the industry; which I am already working on, but I would not like to let the cat out of the bag right now. He also plans to remix Body, shoot a video for it later and follow up with a single from his EP “which will be one of the best EP ever released. I hope to thrill everyone with my brand of music. May God help me.”
