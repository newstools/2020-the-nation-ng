  Former Military President General Ibrahim Babangida (Rtd) has consoled President Muhammadu Buhari over the death of his Chief of Staff, Mallam Abba Kyari. In a letter of condolence to the President, Babangida said: “Abba was a very dedicated, conscientious, forthright, roundly qualified, astute and patriotic servant of Nigeria. “As Chief of Staff he preoccupied himself to always stand by you as a loyal Staff, a friend and an Adviser who always answered the call to duty. “He was ready to always render you necessary support in line with the policy principles and objectives of your administration.” He added: “I have no iota of doubt that Abba had performed all his tasks creditably to your absolute satisfaction believing in his capacity and competency. “He was honest, simple, humble and transparent. Always putting the people, the nation and your good self in all his actions and duties.  “Undoubtedly you and his family will miss Abba the most. As Muslims we believe and accept that we shall all return to Allah, the Supreme Giver of Life. “It is the wish of the Almighty that Abba had completed his life here on earth. It is stated in the Traditions of our beloved Prophet Muhammad, that whosoever dies as a result of an epidemic affliction is a martyr and I fervently pray so it shall be for Abba. I pray that Allah will accord him the reward and honour as a martyr. “Additionally Abba also passed on one of the most auspicious days for Muslims, namely Friday. You have lost a great ally, friend, admirer, and compatriot who served you and the nation with extreme loyalty and patience. “Mr President, I urge you, as a committed Muslim with depth of faith and as a gallant military officer who fought to unite this country, to please remain steadfast in the challenging tasks heaved upon you, our country and people by the COVID-19 epidemic and its effects on our nation and people. I pray for the quick end of this deadly scourge.”
