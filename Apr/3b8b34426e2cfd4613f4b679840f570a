 DMW artiste, Tobechukwu Victor Okoh simply known as Peruzzi has denied ever having an affair with BBNaija Star, Cee C. Peruzzi made the revelation in interaction with followers and fans during a live Instagram chat with an On-Air Personality via Instagram over the week. He noted that the alleged romance he had with Ceec was only a publicity stunt to promote his single ‘Majesty’. The music video had the reality TV star playing his love interest. “We shot the video and that was why we had all the stuff going on because obviously, it was a PR for the song and the video. That was the plan we had but we are friends. That’s my guy,” Peruzzi said during the live interview. Peruzzi got signed to Davido Music Worldwide in 2017 and has since become a force to reckon with in the Nigerian music industry. He recently released a three-track EP during the lockdown.
