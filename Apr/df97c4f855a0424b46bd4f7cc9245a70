Korea based Nigerian striker Lanre Kehinde has praised former and present Super Eagles strikers who have made the Nigerian team a force to reckon with. Kehinde, who said he grew up watching the like of Rashidi Yekini, Samson Siasia, Victor Ikpeba, Daniel Amokachi, Victor Agali, Odion Ighalo and many others, commended their exploits in the green and white jersey, stating that he is also looking to emulate them if given the chance. The 25 year old who joined Incheon United in the K-League in the beginning of the season said watching those strikers play motivated him. “It was fulfilling watching these former stars play. They gave their best to the country and that is what I hope to do if I get a chance, added 6′ 4 ½” striker, who scored 10 goals in 15 appearances for Denizlispor of Turkey in 2019.  The former Ankaragücü of Turkey player also said that the present crop of strikers are also world class and can cause big teams lots of problems. “Presently, the likes Victor Osimhen, Samuel Chukwueze, Samuel Kalu, Simon Moses and Henry Onyekuru are all exciting forwards who can bury a good team any day. “From the Super Eagles’ games played before the COVID-19 pandemic, the forwards proved that they knew their job and I know they will do better as soon as the Nation Cup qualifiers resume after the pandemic,” assured Kehinde who scored 20 goals in 32 appearances for Israeli second division outfit Hapoel Afula in the 2014/15 season.
