 Despite losing his bid to represent Ogun East Senatorial District in 2019, Engr. Deji Ashiru has not stopped impacting his immediate environment outside politics. In fact, his milk of kindness is felt across the board as he has always shown up in solidarity with his people. Apart from his professional achievements, the Managing Director and CEO of Contec Global Energy Limited, also gives back to society by engaging in charity and humanitarian activities in his local community.

Through his EDA foundation, the Oil and Gas guru has extended his hands of love by giving succour to the good people of Ogun East Senatorial district.
