 BANDITS have attacked a village in Niger State, killing two persons and stealing about 2,000 cattle, The Nation gathered. Many residents of Erena in Shiroro council reportedly fled  into the bushes as the assailants shot rapidly during the attack, which took place early Sunday morning. A senator representing Niger East Senatorial District, Alhaji Sani Musa said security strategies deployed so far to curb banditry in the state have failed. Attacks in three councils of the state have continued apace despite military response including airstrikes. Shiroro, Munya, and Rafi local government areas are the epicentre of the attacks. Over 15 people have been killed, eight abducted while over 2,000 forced out of their homes in several communities in those councils. Sani-Musa wondered how the bandits could have breached the security arrangements government claimed to have deployed in the areas. He appealed to President  Muhammadu Buhari to establish a military base in the affected communities. “All the makeshift security arrangements have failed and the bandits have taken over some communities in these three local government areas,” he said. Gunmen also attacked a village in Mayo Belwa, Adamawa State, on Sunday night, killing a youth, Seth Adamu. Our correspondent learnt Monday morning that the gunmen went for Seth Adamu at his residence in his village, Bekusun, and killed him for yet to be ascertained reason. Mayo Belwa has recently been associated with night killings and kidnapping, including the killing of southern Adamawa Zonal chairman of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN), Alhaji Saidu Kolaku, in August last year and the murder of a pastor and politician, Rev Denis Bagauri in January this year. Police spokesman Suleiman Nguruje said he had not been briefed on the incident.
