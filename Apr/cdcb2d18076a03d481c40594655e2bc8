 THE National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has explained that it has not approved any vaccine for clinical trials to combat the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the country. Clearing the air on speculations that clinical trials of Covid-19 vaccine will soon begin in African countries, including Nigeria, the agency stressed that before any clinical trial begins in the country, it must have been conducted in different countries, which may not happen before one year to eighteen months. The Director General of NAFDAC, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye, made this known in statement in Abuja on Thursday. According to her, “Please note, no vaccines have been approved for any clinical trial. That may not happen before one year to 18 months, after clinical trials must have been conducted in different countries. “This will be followed by rigorous in-country assessment in line with laid down protocols to further ensure safety and efficacy.” She further disclosed that NAFDAC has granted conditional emergency use approval of medical devices (COVID-19 Antibody and Antigen Test Kits, PPEs, etc.) to diagnostic companies.
