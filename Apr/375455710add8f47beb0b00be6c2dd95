Tyson Fury’s camp has had no conversations with Deontay Wilder about stepping aside to allow for a clash with Anthony Joshua. Joshua’s promoter Eddie Hearn has previously revealed that his client would be ‘extremely interested’ in taking on WBC champion Fury in an undisputed fight with the IBF, WBA and WBO titles on the line. Hearn has suggested that Wilder has to be willing to ‘take that step-aside money’. But Wilder has no plans to give up on the third fight against Fury, according to the Brit’s promoters Top Rank. Asked about doing a deal with Wilder for the American to step aside, Top Rank president Todd DuBoef told Sky Sports: “I have not personally had any conversations about that. It is not on my radar. “I am working with Wilder’s representatives on coming up with new potential dates in late-summer or early-fall for the Fury fight. We are speaking about potential venues too. “That fight breaking up as a result of [Joshua vs Fury] fight? I have not been privy to any conversations about that. I have not heard that they are willing to step aside. Nobody has communicated that.”
