Nasarawa State Governor Abdullahi Sule has directed that returnees from Lagos and Kano states be quarantined for 14 days, to contain COVID-19 pandemic. The governor gave the directive on Monday in Lafia during a meeting with rulers and religious leaders at the Government House. Sule said this followed the rising spread of the pandemic, and the need to protect the people. Lamenting the spread in Katsina and Kano states, he stressed he was also concerned of the increasing number of persons testing positive for COVID-19 in the FCT. The governor explained that in an earlier meeting, he sought the cooperation of chairmen of local governments, to ensure that returnees from Lagos and Kano were quarantined. Sule noted that 43 persons from Lagos were intercepted in Akwanga on their way to Shendam in Plateau State. He said he got in touch with his colleague in Jos, and sent the returnees back on escort. Five of the arrested persons escaped after their vehicle stopped, on the way to Jos. Thirteen others, he said, claiming to come from Nasarawa State, were on their way back to Lafia. “Even if they are our relations, as long as they are returning home from Lagos or Kano, we will … isolate them and test them,” he said.
