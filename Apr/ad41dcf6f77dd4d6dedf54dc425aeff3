Access Bank Plc is at the forefront of the interventions deployed to fight the COVID-19 pandemic by big players in the private sector, the bank’s Group Managing Director, Herbert Wigwe has said. He said the bank played a major role in the formation of the Coalition against COVID-19 (CACOVID), a task force instituted to ensure the minimisation of the impact of Coronavirus pandemic in Nigeria. Speaking on the bank’s activities,  Wigwe said, “In our characteristic manner of offering ‘more than banking,’ Access Bank is at the forefront of the fight against COVID-19. Through our various projects, we are looking to support the government and the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) by providing facilities that can serve as both testing and isolation centers. With a guiding strategy of making impactful social investments, and giving back to the society, this new joint effort with other members of CACOVID has seen the bank donate N1 billion to facilitate the building of 1000-bed isolation centers across the six geopolitical zones of the country. The building of the test and isolation centers will be in phases. The first phase of the project is the construction of additional testing and isolation centers, in Lagos (Yaba and Gbagada), Enugu, Kano, Port Harcourt, Borno, and Abuja.
