 The Croatian Construction Minister, Predrag Stromar, on Wednesday said March 22 earthquake which hit Zagreb inflicted damage of around 42 billion kunas (or 6 billion dollars). Stromar, in an interview with the National Broadcaster HRT, said that an emergency law would be passed to finance the repairs. “Many buildings in the capital were damaged by the strongest in a series of jolts, of a magnitude of 5.4. One teenage girl was killed by a collapsing roof,“Stromar said. Zagreb’s iconic Catholic cathedral, which has been under reconstruction since the 1980s, was among the badly damaged buildings. Meanwhile, a tip of one of its twin towers fell immediately, while the other had to be removed later.(dpa/NAN)
