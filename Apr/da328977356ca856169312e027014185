By Precious Igbonwelundu  The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has commenced distribution of oxygen to isolation centres and designated hospitals across the country to boost the fight against Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). NAF at the wake of the disease in the country commenced production of oxygen at its Liquid Oxygen Plants since one of the symptoms of the disease is difficulty in breathing. The NAF assembled its experts from various units and kicked the ball rolling to produce large quantities of oxygen which are now being across the country. The Nation reports that the C-130 logistics aircraft has already airlifted some of the oxygen cylinders from the Liquid Oxygen Plant for distribution. Aside the production and distribution of the oxygen, the NAFâ€™s tailoring unit has also embarked in the production of personal protective equipment (PPE) and masks for healthcare workers and frontline officials in Port Harcourt (PHC). The service has continuously airlifted healthcare personnel, equipment and supplies across the country following the closure of airports, as well as brought back experts of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) who were trapped in Congo Brazzaville.
