The National Engineering and Technical Company (NETCO), an arm of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), has provided palliatives to its host community in Iru Victoria Island Local Council Development Area (LCDA) in Lagos State. The palliative package contains 2kg of rice, 2kg of garri, a pack of water and antiseptic soap. The Managing Director of NETCO, Usman Baba, said the company decided to support the less privileged in its host communities because the lockdown has denied a lot of families incomes and food especially those on daily wages. If they don’t go out, they won’t feed, he said. He said: “As part of our corporate social responsibility, we are here to support the less privileged in our host community, the NNPC and the Federal Government’s efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). “The less privileged who cannot afford to go out for their daily earnings due to lockdown. We noticed people begging for food in the morning and evening every day, so we decided to do this as our own little help to support them. “We are having the distribution in two batches. This is the first batch, given to the Oniru community and we have reached out to 800 families. The second batch will come up on Friday. We are targeting another community, the Iru community, around the Bar Beach area in the same local government area. The second batch will be 700 families. The NETCO chief appealed to Nigerians to observe the safety precautions as recommended by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) by washing hands regularly, keeping safe distance and wearing protective materials. We are a small company, so what we spent on the palliative support is about N6 million.
