As part of government’s efforts geared towards containing the spread of COVID-19, the Minister of Science and Technology, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu has called on the management of Raw Materials Research and Development Council (RMRDC) to come up with a unique design and produce facemasks locally that meets the standards set by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Dr. Onu, who gave the directive during a facility visit to the headquarters of the RMRDC over the weekend in Abuja while inspecting its inputs into the COVID-19 management in Nigeria, noted that the production of the facemasks will save the country a huge foreign exchange being depleted through importation. Onu commended the (RMRDC) for using wild tubers in producing pharmaceutical starch used in industries, adding that it will save billions of Naira for the country. He pointed out that the production of pharmaceutical grade starch from wild yam tubers could be used to produce to capsules, tablets, syrups and glucose, stressing that the innovations could help Nigeria reduce import of these materials and improve the country’s health sector. According to him, many businesses could be generated through the council as many Nigerians would be encouraged to venture into wild tuber production and other raw materials. He further said that Nigeria has competent scientists, stressing that it could produce vaccines capable of fighting infectious diseases. The Minister noted that Nigeria cannot afford to import medical materials at this moment, lamenting that this could strain the nation’s foreign exchange reserve and harm the economy.
