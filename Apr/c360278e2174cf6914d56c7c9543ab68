 Nigerian rapper Ycee has advised fans to stop comparing creatives on social media and focus more on supporting them in the industry. The ‘Omo Alhaji’ rapper made this known in an Instagram live broadcast tagged ANBTRADIO. The rapper uses the platform to play his unreleased music and engage in intellectual discussion with fans.  “We all need to come together, I hate seeing my names on this rap conversation and it is always the same thing, Ycee or Dremo, Ycee or Nasty C, Vector or this person, MI or that person, we are just running in circles, going nowhere fast. Support your creatives that’s all,” said Ycee. Ycee started his music career in 2012 as an underground rapper and released his debut studio album, Ycee vs Zaheer, on November 8, 2019, which is a mixture of hip-hop, trap, Afro-house, hyphy, R&B, and Alte.
