 ANTHONY Joshua has announced in a YouTube interview with Sky Sports Boxing the six fighters he wants to fight before he retires. Joshua named Oleksandr Usyk, Deontay Wilder, Tyson Fury, Luis Ortiz, Jarrell Miller and Adam Kownacki. Joshua’s bout with Fury is the most anticipated fight in heavyweight boxing, maybe even all divisions, it is the fight every boxing fan wants to see. Two boxers, one coming off a win against Deontay Wilder and one who holds four of the five belts the heavyweight division offers. Fury, who is currently unbeaten in his professional boxing career, has, like Joshua, beaten Wladimir Klitschko, so it would be interesting to see the two collide together inside the ropes. The only difference between the meetings with the Ukrainian is that Fury beat a younger and fitter Klitschko, while Joshua beat a Klitschko who was on the way out. Joshua versus Wilder is a fight that could go under the radar in order of importance now that the American isn’t a champion. Although Wilder is still regarded by most as the hardest hitting heavyweight in the world, so a fight between the pair would be epic. Wilder always poses a threat with that massive left hook, however, most heavyweight boxing fans agree that Joshua would see him off. With Joshua not able to fight Fury until at least the summer of 2021 now with the WBC demanding mandatory challenger Dillian Whyte fight the title holder, it is thought Joshua will use this time to fight Oleksandr Usyk. Usyk recently moved up to the heavyweight division after obliterating the cruiserweight division.  The southpaw fighter has a record of 17 wins (13KOs) and 0 losses and was the first cruiserweight in the history of the division to hold all four major world championship belts. Anyone who knows anything about the Ukrainian will tell you how much of a threat he is to Joshua. Despite having a knockout percentage of 76.47%, Usyk is no stranger to a boxing master class and would be a great challenge for Joshua.
