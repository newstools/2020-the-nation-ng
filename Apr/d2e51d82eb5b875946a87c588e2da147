 FOLLOWING the outbreak of coronavirus disease which has led to the closure of boarders and the lockdown of some states, the Nigerian Merchant Navy Corps has suspended the earlier advertised recruitment exercise till further notice. Speaking with journalists in Uyo, the National Director of the organization, Mr. Sekenimde Sunday, said the suspension became imperative due to the increase in the deadly disease in the country. Mr. Sunday, however, directed his officers on-shore and off-shore to join hands with government agencies and work towards preventing the spread of the pandemic in the country. The National Director hinted that the recruitment exercise was announced as the organization was preparing to fully return to her operational base at Aya Obio Akpa, Oruk Anam Local Government Area in Akwa Ibom State after recording victory at Uyo High Court with suit number FHC/UY/CS/67/2015. It was gathered that the court had resolved all issues of legalities or otherwise of the Nigerian Merchant Navy Corps in favour of the organization. He used the occasion to warn those parading themselves as officers of the corps to desist forthwith or be ready to face the full weight of the law. Mr. Sunday advised anybody who claims to be a member of the organization to log into www.nigerianmerchantnavy.com to confirm his or her membership. The National Director appealed to sister security agencies to assist the organization in identifying those illegal officers. Meanwhile, the Nigerian Merchant Navy Corps has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for steps so far taken to prevent the spread of the disease in the country. He lauded the Akwa Ibom State Governor, Mr. Udom Emmanuel, for the preventive measures taken by his government to prevent the spread of the deadly disease in the state.
