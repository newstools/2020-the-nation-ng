 COOKING gas retailers have obtained an exemption from the lockdown, the Nigerian Association of Liquefied Petroleum Gas Marketers (NALPGAM) said on Wednesday. Its Executive Secretary, Mr Bassey Essien, said in a statement that in a bid to avoid a misinterpretation of the directive, NALPGAM sought clarification from the Lagos State Ministry of Energy and Resources. It said it got clarification that gas plants and retail outlets are part of essential service providers. NALPGAM said: “The fact that people have to stay indoors for two weeks in the first instance entails that households must cook and eat for the stay-at-home order to be effective. “Lagos State Government, through the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, granted the approval that gas plants and cooking gas retailers and their personnel are classified as essential service providers and their product essential in ensuring the sustainability of the people’s continued stay at home to curtail the spread of COVID-19. “Therefore, LPG plants are part of the essential services and are exempted from the lockdown and should thus be granted access to the smooth running of their facilities and operations, as well as free movement of their personnel from their homes to the facilities.” Essien urged gas plants to maintain all safety and hygienic measures to prevent the spread of COVID 19 while workers must have their identity cards. NALPGAM said it has written the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) for other states to make similar clarifications.
