Manchester United striker Odion Ighalo has made clear he wants to stay with Manchester United after the completion of his loan in the summer. Ighalo’s future has been the subject of much speculation since the Nigerian’s impressive performances after signing from Shanghai Shenhua on deadline day in the January transfer window. The 30-year-old has scored four goals and provided one assist in eight appearances and United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has previously opened up about his admiration for Ighalo on a number of occasions. United will need to pay £15million to make Ighalo’s deal a permanent one, but the former Watford forward’s parent club have tabled a monster £400,000 per-week contract to keep him in the Chinese Super League when his temporary stay ends. And Ighalo has intensified rumours that United will payout to keep him beyond this summer. When asked by a fan during a Twitter Q&A if he would like to stay with the Red Devils if he was offered a contract extension, Ighalo had a simple reply. “Of course.” The Nigeria international has become a fan favourite in just over two months with his boyhood club and Solskjaer shares supporters’ hopes that he will stay at Old Trafford beyond the end of his loan deal. “It’s a loan, but when you’re in the door and if you impress it gives you a chance,” Solskjaer said in March. “That’s exactly the same for everyone who signs if it’s permanent or it’s a loan. “If you impress as a player, if you impress as a person, if you can help this group improve, then of course there’s a chance that we’ll look at extending things.”
