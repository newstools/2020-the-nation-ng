Delta State Governor Ifeanyi Okowa has commiserated with the Akinjide family on the death of Chief Richard Akinjide. The governor, in a statement on Wednesday by his Chief Press Secretary, Olisa Ifeajika, said Akinjide would be remembered for his famous ‘technical’ submission which led to the resolution of the controversy surrounding the electoral victory of Alhaji Shagari and the defunct National Party of Nigeria (NPN) in the 1979 presidential election. According to him, the late lawyer made outstanding contributions to the development of the country before, during and after serving as its chief law officer. As President of the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA) from 1970 to 1973, Akinjide served without blemish, Okowa added. “Chief Richard Akinjide was one of the politicians of the pre-independence era, a First Republic Parliamentarian and Minister of Education and Second Republic Attorney General of the Federation. He contributed immensely to legal reforms and development of jurisprudence in Nigeria. “I convey our heartfelt condolences to his family, the government and people of Oyo state, the NBA on the demise of the renowned lawyer and elder statesman. We prayer that God will grant his family and colleagues the fortitude to bear this loss,” Okowa added.
