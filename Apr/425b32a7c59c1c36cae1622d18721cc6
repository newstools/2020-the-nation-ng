 The Katsina State Government has rescued two more kidnapped victims, thus bringing the total to 19 out of the 20 kidnapped passengers of a Mina–Katsina bound commercial bus. Recall that the passengers who were travelling to Katsina from Mina were flagged down at Maraba Kankara by unknown gunmen who disguised as security operatives at about 9pm on Sunday, March 22. The kidnapped 19 were later released in batches, with the first batch of 12 released on Wednesday March 25; second batch later the same month March, while two were released on April 9th. The Secretary to the Government of the State, Mustapha Muhammad Inuwa, told newsmen at the reception of the two rescued women that the exercise was successfully carried out by the repentant bandits, security agency and the state government.  He said, “We appreciate their roles, especially the repentant bandits. We have no words to thank them for what they have been doing.’’ “So far, out of the 20 victims, 19 are back and have joined their families. Of the remaining three, we now have two, while only one is yet to be rescued. We are working towards getting him back, if he is still alive. Like the police that brought the two girls said, they will join the repentant bandits to search for him.” The SGS further assured that the two latest recued victims will be taken to Government House Clinic for medical examination and rehabilitation before being allowed to join their families. He commended efforts of traditional rulers in the area for the success recorded so far.
