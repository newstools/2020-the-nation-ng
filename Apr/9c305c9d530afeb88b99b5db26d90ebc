From Osagie Otabor, Akure  Ondo State Deputy Governor, Hon Agboola Ajayi, has disowned a Peoples Democratic Party campaign poster and video with his name and picture. The campaign poster with the picture and name of Hon Agboola showed he wants to contest for the governorship under the PDP platform. But Hon Agboola said the campaign poster and video did not emanate from him. Agboola who spoke through his spokesman, Babatope Okeowo, said he is a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and has not declared any governorship ambition. He said the poster and video were the handiwork of some characters who are bent on creating disharmony in the political space of Ondo State. According to Agboola, “Recall that a WhatsApp’s group titled ‘Agboola Ajayi 4 Sure 2020’ was created last year by Omobone Tunde to champion the governorship ambition of the Deputy Governor. “The man in question has denied having anything to do with the WhatsApp’s group. “The Deputy Governor has also said these characters who see blackmail and propaganda as legitimate tools would paste his governorship posters. “Once again, the Deputy Governor did not authorize the purported video or any poster that may emanate from these people.”
