 NASARAWA State Governor Abdullahi Sule has said plans are at advance stage to convert the hotels built for Almajiri school, during the administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan into a 300-bed isolation centre. The Almajiri hostel which is currently hosting Internally Displaced Persons, IDPS from Taraba State is located in Shabu, Lafia North Development Area. Governor Sule disclosed this on Tuesday while hosting officials of the Nasarawa State Students Association (NASSA), who were at the Government House, on a courtesy call. He said even though the state is yet to record any case of COVID-19, still there is every need to prepare for any eventuality, especially with the stateâ€™s proximity to Abuja, which has continued to record more cases of Coronavirus.
