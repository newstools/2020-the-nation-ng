The Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), World Tennis Association (WTA) and the International Tennis Federation are creating a coronavirus relief fund to help players affected by the sport’s current shutdown. Also in the group of the tennis world creating the fund is organizers of the four Grand Slams. A joint statement by the group on Tuesday said the specifics about how much money would be collected and method of distribution among the lower-ranked players were not disclosed. The statement said details were in the process of being finalised. “These discussions have been progressing well and details are being finalised with an announcement expected in the near future,” the statement said. The tennis season was halted in early March due to the coronavirus pandemic, which makes it difficult for those in the lower echelons of the sport who depend solely on tournament winnings to earn a living. According to the statement, both the men’s ATP Tour and the WTA, which runs the women’s circuit, will administer the players’ relief program and each of the seven stakeholders will make a significant contribution. “We know that for our players, as well as for so many people worldwide, there is the need for financial support for those who need it most and we look forward to finalizing and sharing the further details of a plan in due course,” the statement said.
