Naira Marley has put a halt to his exuberances on social media to embrace Islam during the holy month of Ramadan. The 25-year-old father of three stunned his 3.1 million followers on Instagram and 1.1 million followers on Twitter to share quotes from the Quran at the start of Ramadan on Friday, April 24. Reacting to some of the backlashes he got from some followers on Twitter and Instagram, Naira Marley said, “You will never be able to please all of the people all of the time, so concentrate on pleasing your maker (ALLAH) because that’s what matters.” Before the response, the UK trained singer had mocked those calling him out by saying, “Hating on someone you should be using as a prayer point.” Naira Marley was born Azeez Fashola in 1994. In less than 14 months, he became Nigeria’s most controversial music artist with at least 3 viral songs and large followership on social media and music scene. He has proudly promoted sex, alcohol, and drugs in his music but said in different interviews that he gets musical inspiration from Islamic songs and Fuji music. The singer also revealed to Olisa Adibua in his interview on The Truth that he began a career in music after he made £250, 000 from doing odd jobs on the streets of London.
