After a teleconference on Wednesday the NGF cane up with a communiqué signed by the Forum Chairman and Governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi. The NGF said: “Following a briefing from the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning on fiscal measures taken by the Federal Government to mitigate the economic impact of COVID-19 pandemic, the Forum called for urgent fiscal measures to safeguard the liquidity of state governments.  “This includes the acceleration of an arrangement to suspend all state deductions and restructure all debt service payments on Federal Government and Central Bank of Nigeria-owned debts.” A Presidency source said:” These governors are just being smart. They are already having financial problems.  COVID-19 is a perfect excuse to ask for such concession. We cannot blame them. “
