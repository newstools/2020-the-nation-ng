Ebonyi Governnor David Umahi has banned the use of motorcycle in the state. He stated this in a live broadcast on Saturday. The Governnor, who said the ban is statewide, expressed dismay at the flagrant disregard for the closure of the state borders by commercial motorcyclists who smuggle returnees through trackroads. The Nation reports that the State Government had closed borders as part of measures to fight the deadly coronavirus, which has so far infected 305 persons in the country and caused seven deaths. But commercial motorcyclists and commercial vehicle operators have continued to bring people into the state. The Governor also warned that any vehicle caught flouting the lockdown by bringing people into the state will be impounded and auctioned off. A statement by the Special Assistant no Media to the Governor noted that the ban is with immediate effect. “The Governor of Ebonyi State, Engr. David Nweze Umahi, has noted with dismay how misguided elements hire motorcyclists popularly called Okada to enter Ebonyi State through track roads which contravenes the COVID-19 Law 2020 and as a result, has directed immediate ban of the use of Motorcycles (Okada) in Ebonyi State”. “This directive is without exception and the ban is an all-time ban across the state”. “It is imperative to note that our dear Governor is working tirelessly to ensure that this deadly Coronavirus does not enter our dear State and will not relent in his efforts to ensure that the COVID-19 Pandemic does not enter Ebonyi,” the statement said.
