No fewer than 92 suspected cultists have been arrested by police in different parts of Lagos, it has been gathered. The arrest came as residents in parts of the state rallied to stem robbery attacks in their communities during the lockdown. They keep vigil at night, make bonfires and engage the services of hunters to ward off the hoodlums. On Sunday, operatives of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) arrested two men after a foiled robbery in Ikorodu, Lagos. The suspects Toheeb Sanusi, 21, and Adewale Adeshina, 24 , were arrested with a locally-made revolver pistol and cutlass. Police spokesman Bala Elkana said the Commissioner of Police Hakeem Odumosu has given commanders of tactical units in the state a clear instruction to deal decisively with armed hoodlums in any part of the state during the lockdown.
