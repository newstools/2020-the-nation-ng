The Surulere District headquarters of Cherubim and Seraphim (C&S) has donated palliatives to 100 residents of Onisemo Street in its neighbourhood in Coker Aguda Local Council Development Area (LCDA), Lagos State. Apostle Olayinka Balogun, who represented the District Chairman/General Leader, Special Apostle (Prophet) Sunday Korede,  said the church embarked on the programme in obedience to the teaching of Jesus Christ who said those who show mercy shall be blessed. According to him, the church should not watch while the people were hungry following the stay-at-home order. The Administrative Secretary, Mrs. Taiwo A. Taiwo, said the church did not give out money as some corporate organisations and individuals were doing because beneficiaries would go to the market to buy food and ‘this would discourage social distancing, a habit the government has banned’. She said this was the church’s first Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) project for the year, adding that more would come. She recalled that the church last year held a three-day medical outreach in partnership with Rotary International District 9110’s Health Family programme, where over 1,000 residents benefited. Two beneficiaries – Mrs. Philomina Odili and Ernest Ilodanye – expressed satisfaction with the donations. They thanked God and the church for the products, saying it should keep doing good.
