Kano state Governor, Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, has relieved the appointment of the commissioner of Works and Infrastructure, Engr. Mu’azu Magaji with immediate effect. According to a statement signed by the Commissioner for Information, Malam Muhammad Garba, the commissioner was removed following his unguarded utterances against the person of the late Chief of Staff to the President, Mallam Abba Kyari.  He said as a public servant, the commissioner ought to have respected the office by refraining from any act capable of rendering it to disrepute. “The action of a public servant, personal or otherwise reflects back on the government and therefore, the Ganduje administration would not tolerate people in official capacities engaging in personal vendetta or otherwise,” the statement read. However, Magaji in his reaction said, “HE Ganduje has relieved me of my appointment as Commissioner in Kano State Government! I remain grateful and appreciative HE difficult decision… Masha Allah and I am very grateful to HE for the opportunity to serve him and Kano people”
