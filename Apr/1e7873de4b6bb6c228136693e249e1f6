Rivers Hoopers’ assistant captain Roland Alalibo has joined the BALTogether campaign, which is aimed at advising basketballers, fans and stakeholders on maintaining good hygiene during the Coronavirus pandemic. While urging everyone to stay safe in a video shared on Twitter, Alalibo said that this were uncertain and difficult times, which has seen everyone united because of the spread of COVID-19. “I know these are uncertain and difficult times. The spread of the coronavirus has seen us all working together,” said the shooting guard, who will lead his team’s charge when the BAL begins. “Please take the right step of protecting yourselves and the people around you by following the health guidelines of washing your hand frequently for at least 20 seconds, avoiding touching your face and mouth with your hands, while also coughing into your bent elbow,” Alalibo added. The shooting guard also urged everyone to stay informed by seeking information from reliable sources. According to NBA Africa, the campaign was inspired by NBA Together, noting that videos would be put up by representatives of teams taking part in Basketball Africa League (BAL), which was postponed due to the outbreak of COVID-19.
