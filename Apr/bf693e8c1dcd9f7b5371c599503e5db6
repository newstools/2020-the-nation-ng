Taiwo Akerele, the Chief of Staff to Edo Governor Godwin Obaseki has resigned his appointment. It was gathered the youthful Akerele, an indigene of Igarra in Akoko-Edo Local Government Area of Edo State, accused Obaseki of sidelining him. The Governor is at loggerheads with his benefactor, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, the National Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC), who handed over to him. Akerele, who was appointed on November 14, 2016, in his resignation dated April 25, 2020, said: “My decision to exit the government is based on administrative and governance grounds. “I am solidly with His Excellency, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, in his quest to transform Edo State. His mission and vision resonate with mine. “This is all I have to say, I will like to be given opportunity to go private as I part ways administratively with the government, based on principles. “I thank His Excellency for the opportunity given to me to serve in this capacity and also thanks to His Royal Majesty, Oba of Benin, Oba Ewuare II, for his immense leadership and support during the period I served in this capacity. May his reign be long and peaceful. Amen” When contacted, Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Paul Ohonbamu and Obaseki’s Special Adviser on Media and Communication Strategy, Crusoe Osagie, didn’t respond to enquiries on the development.
