A Non-Governmental Organisation, Zimuzo Development Foundation (ZDF), has donated food items and protective kits to the inmates of the Nigerian Correctional Service Anambra State Command. The items, which included 50 cartons of Indomie, hand sanitisers, buckets and soaps, were distributed to the Awka, Onitsha and Nnewi Custodial Centres of the state. Presenting the items to the inmates, the Director General of the foundation, Rev. Ukadike Ibeabuchi, said the gesture was aimed at cushioning the effects of the hardship ocassioned by the lockdown as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. He said the choice of the Custodian Centres was informed by the helplessness of the inmates whose conditions would not allow to go fend for themselves, moreso with the sit-at-home directives. He said: “Our Chairman, George Moghalu said we should distribute these items to the inmates to ensure there’s enough food in the centers so the inmates don’t die of hunger and starvation until they are done with their jail terms. “We also brought some protective kits to make sure the inmates are properly protected from the Coronavirus pandemic.” Ibeabuchi said the generosity would be extended to the orphanages and widows in the state to ensure they were not subjected to untold hardship while the lockdown lasted. Receiving the items on behalf of the Centre, the Officer incharge of the Centre DCC Akabueze Edwin, represented by the officer incharge Welfare ASC Okafor Henry, expressed appreciation to the group for the gesture, assuring that the items would go a long way to assauging the pains the inmates passed through. “We are very happy and grateful for this generosity. Infact, it’s coming at a time they are most needed. We pray that God will bless and reward you immensely,” he added.
