President of Nigeria Coaches Association (NCA) Ladan Bosso has  thrown his weight behind the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) on  fresh conditions inserted in the new contract being proposed to  Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr. Bosso said the conditions  were  not new to coaches  and insisted  that paying wages in country’s local currency is never a crime or punishment as far as the coach domicile in the  country of his job. ” Honestly I back the NFF on  some of the conditions  in the new contract for coach Gernot Rohr especially  on the need to monitor players in the league,” the former Flying Eagles told NationSport. “It means the NFF are now  determined to improve our domestic league and restore the confidence of the local players. “ While commending the NFF, Bosso advised Rohr to peruse the new contract in order to arrive  at a common ground with his employers:  “Rohr should know that in every contract there is room for improvement and negotiation; and  I will advise he studies  the new conditions before signing. “ He is experience in coaching  and he knows what is good for him and his family. He has worked for four  years in Nigeria and I think  collecting his salary  in local currency might turn out to be in his favour. “If he has the interest of Nigerian Football and he wants to leave a legacy, he should not consider the additional conditions as an impediment in achieving success.”
