   The General Overseer of Resurrection Praise Ministries for Africa alias Jehovah Sharp Sharp, Archbishop Samson Benjamin has been arrested by the police in Lagos for violating the lockdown order. Benjamin, the police alleged, led about 100 persons to the Chinese Embassy in Victoria Island to protest the mistreatment of Nigerians in China. According to the cleric, the Chinese were operating freely in Nigeria despite the fact that COVID-19 started in their country but have chosen to mistreat Nigerians and other blacks. It was gathered that officials of the Embassy sent a video clip of the alleged invasion to the police, which prompted operatives from Victoria Island Division to move to the scene to effect arrest. A source, who hinted on the arrest, told The Nation that the cleric was being detained at the Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (SCIID), Yaba and may be arraigned on Wednesday before a Chief Magistratesâ€™ Court The source said the bishop denied going to the embassy with 100 persons, insisting that he was there by himself to register his displeasure over the ill-treatment of Nigerians in China. Calls to the spokesman for the command Bala Elkana were neither picked nor returned at the time of this report.
