The Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) has threatened to commence industrial action following the decision of the Port Harcourt Refinery Company (PHRC) to sack over 175 causal workers. The workers said nothing will stop them from going on strike in the next 48 hours if the management of PHRC failed to rescind its decision. The NUPENG Port Harcourt Zone said it would stop the operations of all tanker drivers, petrol station workers and others if PHRC refused to recall the sacked workers. The Zonal Chairman of the union, Mr. Mina Samuel, who spoke on Thursday in Port Harcourt described the action of the PHRC as insensitive, saying it was unfortunate that the company chose a period others were protecting the rights of workers across the world to sack its employees. Samuel said it was unthinkable that workers would suffer such while  struggling to survive the COVID-19 lockdown. He said: “The Port Harcourt Zone of NUPENG may be forced to come out of its shell as a result of PHRC management’s action, to withdraw the supply of petroleum products within Port Harcourt Zone if the PHRC fails to reverse its decision with immediate effect. “Consequently. the Port Harcourt Zonal Council of NUPENG is by this notice giving PHRC management 72 hours from today, the 2nd of April 2020, to direct its contractors to withdraw all termination letters issued to all NUPENG members in their employment. We advise that Port Harcourt Re?nery management engage the union once normalcy returns to the state if need be.
