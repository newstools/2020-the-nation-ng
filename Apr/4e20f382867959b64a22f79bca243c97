The Oyo State Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Comrade Bayo Titilola-Sodo, has hailed the state government for imposing a dusk to dawn curfew from 7pm to 6am on the state. He said it would curtail the spread of Coronavirus. Titilola-Sodo enjoined Governor Seyi Makinde to comply with the directives from the Covid-19 Task Force and that of the World Health Organisation (WHO), in order to ensure a quick recovery from the infection. Titilola-Sodo, who is also the state President of the Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE), described Governor Makinde as a God sent man who has remained proactive about workersâ€™ welfare as well as the well-being of the residents, the latest being the payment of the January arrears of minimum wage with March salary, followed by several far reaching steps in the containment of Covid-19. Titilola-Sodo praised the appointment of Prof. Temitope Alonge, the former chief medical director (CMD) of the University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan as the Head of COVID-19 Task Force.
