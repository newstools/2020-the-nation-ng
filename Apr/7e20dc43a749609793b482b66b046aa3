  SEBASTIAN Egbuleopkro and his wife Vivian from Umusuode Alaike in Obowo Local Government Area of Imo State are still seeking for justice seven years after they narrowly escaped death. The husband and wife were bathed in acid following the refusal of the woman to fall in love with her husband’s junior brother, Celestine. Speaking to the Nation in an exclusive interview, the couple said the assailant attacked them in 2011 in their room where he poured acid on them. According to the woman their ordeal began in 2011 when the husband’s brother, Celestine professed his love for her which she turned down. “In the absence of my husband,  he wanted me to befriend him but I refused his love advances.” Vivian who disclosed how the suspect poured the substance on them, said that her hands, face, chest, ears and legs suffered major burns,  adding that she also lost her eyesight in the process. Also her husband suffered burns from his neck to stomach, she added. She said that they were admitted at the UNTH,  Enugu where they spent seven years through the help of a philanthropist, Eze Goddy Okeke who is now incapacitated by sickness. “We need help. We have six children, five boys and a girl. We don’t have food and the money to buy food items is difficult because I can’t go about to beg because there is lock down and no movement, “ she pleaded. She also asked for justice because their attacker who allegedly escaped from Okigwe prison is said to be moving freely at somewhere in Abia State. “The man escaped justice from the prison and he is moving freely at somewhere in Abia State,” she disclosed.
