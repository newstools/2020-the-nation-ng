 GOVERNOR Hope Uzodinma of Imo State has appointed former Nigeria International and retired Director-General of the defunct National Sports Commission (NSC), Dr. Patrick Ekeji, as his Deputy Chief of Staff. Ekejiâ€™s latest appointment was coming barely a month after he successfully carried out a previous assignment as the chairman of a seven-man Imo Sports Commission Review Committee. As the head of Imo Sports Commission Review Committee, Ekeji used his wealth of experience to save the state government from what would have degenerated into a public embarrassment when he resolved an agitation over unpaid camping allowances by aggrieved athletes preparing for the now postponed 2020 National Sports Festival. Ekeji, who briefly coached the Green Eagles in 1986, said he considered his new assignment as a call to duty, promising to give his best in ensuring that Imo State moves to the next level in all spheres of development. Ekeji had previously served Imo State in 1993 as Director of Sports before he was appointed the Director of Sports at the NSC in December 1994. He was later appointed as Director of Sports Development in 2001 and as DG in 2009 before his retirement 2013.
