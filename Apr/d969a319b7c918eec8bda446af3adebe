 KADUNA State Government has expressed fear, that the sixth case of COVID-19 in the state confirmed by the National Disease Control (NCDC) on Friday may cause community transmission of the disease in the state. This came as the state government revealed that, the latest case, who came to Kaduna recently from Lagos through public transport, is not a contact of the index case in the State. Commissioner for Health, Dr Amina Mohammed Baloni, yesterday, said that the latest case “is a male who worked as a gateman in the Mando area and recently returned from Lagos.” The Commissioner in a statement, explained that, the sixth case had “travelled to Kaduna on public transport and made contact with the authorities as his symptoms worsened. The patient has been evacuated to the state’s Infectious Disease Centre.” Dr. Baloni while arguing that, the latest case presents the nightmare scenario of possible community transmission in the state said, “it is very difficult and complicated to trace the contacts of a patient who came from Lagos via public transport and has had some instance of local commuting since his arrival.” “The Rapid Response Team is trying its utmost to elicit from him a list of his contacts, so that they can be traced and monitored. He does not know who his fellow passengers from Lagos are. But the team is working to develop an idea of his local contacts in Kaduna, including any vehicles he commuted in and people he met at the hospital he visited and within his neighbourhood,” she said The statement maintained that government has banned motorcycle taxis and Keke Napeps because they do not satisfy the conditions for social distancing and reiterated that “it is important to stay at home, go out only when absolutely necessary and practise personal hygiene, especially washing hands with soap and water regularly. Residents should also observe respiratory hygiene.”
