 NINETY-THREE residents of 16B, Barrister Ahmed Street, Awodiora, Lagos have been rendered homeless as a family house and 32 other apartments were razed. A tenant, Mr. James Michael, said the inferno started when a tenant lit a candle after power failure and placed it on a wooden rack. He said, “The woman didn’t raise the alarm even though she was there when the fire began. Perhaps she thought she could handle it herself until the situation got out of hand. At the time of the incident, my family and I were asleep as well as the other neigbours. We were woken by the smoke, but then it was too late. “I quickly got my family  out of the house before even thinking of saving properties. And so, from one house to another, the fire razed down the entire building. So many things were lost including foodstuff, furniture, home appliances clothes, important documents such as credentials and other properties worth millions of naira. I was able to save just my television set, my generator, my bed, and few clothes. Houses affected by the inferno were estimated to be between 40 and 45.” Another source told The Nation that the tenant had deliberately set the house on fire after the landlord gave her a quit notice.
