Dr. Akintunde Ogunfeyimi, the Chief Medical Director, Ondo State Specialist Hospital, Okitipupa, on Wednesday warned Nigerians who develop COVID-19 symptoms against visiting private hospitals for treatment. Ogunfeyimi told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Okitipupa that the warning became necessary because private hospitals were not equipped to handle coronavirus cases. He advised Nigerians with symptoms such as dry cough, common cold, regular sneezing, high fever, high temperature, difficulty in swallowing and breathing, should immediately report to government hospitals. He said that state governments in partnership with the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) had created Isolation Centres with the primary responsibility of taking all necessary steps to resuscitate patients with index cases. “Nigerians are warned not to patronise private hospitals if they develop any of the symptoms of the coronavirus because no private hospital has the apparatus to treat such. “State governments in partnership with NCDC have put in place the facilities at Isolation Centres to take necessary care to resuscitate patients or handle cases,” he said.
