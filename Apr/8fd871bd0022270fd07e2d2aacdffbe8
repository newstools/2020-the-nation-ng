 The federal government is putting measures in place to ensure producers of sanitisers don’t face difficulties in getting ethanol constantly for the production of hand sanitisers. The Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Adeniyi Adebayo  disclosed this in Abuja during  the weekly engagement with the Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) of the Committee On Sustainable Production/Delivery of Essential Commodities During COVID-19, stating that collaboration with stakeholders will   guarantee the availability of raw materials for the quick and mass production of sanitisers which is a daily necessity in the fight against the pandemic. Adebayo said the ministry has arranged a teleconference with almost all producers of sanitisers in the country, the teleconference is geared towards ensuring availability of ethanol for the production of hand sanitisers that will serve the nation.  He added that the government is collaborating with stakeholders in the production circle to harness the benefits of the production of ethanol in making sanitiser to curb the spread of COVID-19 pandemic in the country. Adebayo also emphasized on the need to observe market protocol  which is wearing of face masks and having hand sanitiser among other precautionary measures on approved market days before being allowed access into the market for transactions. According to the minister, while there is an undeniable need for markets to be open on some days for people to restock on household supplies, it is most important for the set protocol during the process to be complied with to the latter. The use of face masks and hand sanitisers on market days are non-negotiable to limit the spread of the virus until the scourge blows over.
