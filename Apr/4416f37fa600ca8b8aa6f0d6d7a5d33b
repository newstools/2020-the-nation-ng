Fitch Ratings, a globally-renowned credit rating agency, says   Stanbic IBTC Holdings PLC and its banking subsidiary, Stanbic IBTC Bank PLC, have retained their National Long-Term Ratings of AAA (na) and F1+(nga). The report shows that Stanbic IBTC Bank PLC is excluded from Fitch’s Rating Watch Negative (RWN) list of banks, even in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on businesses. The Fitch ‘AAA(nga)’ ratings signify the highest score in its National Rating scale for the country and it is given to issuers with the lowest expectations of default risk, compared to other issuers. Furthermore, issuers or obligations that have the strongest capacity for timely payment of financial commitments relative to other issuers in the same country are rated F1+(nga). The Long and Short-term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of  the banks are driven by their stand-alone credit profiles as determined by their Viability Rating (VRs).
