 A HERD of 20 cows have reportedly died at a farm on the campus of the Kogi State Polytechnic, Lokoja. The cows were said to have grazed on Thursday afternoon at the school farm shortly before their death, triggering suspicion that they  may eaten grass poisoned by farm herbicides. An official of the institution  confirmed the development on a telepone call with the correspondent, though a lecturer in the school said 12 cows died. “Yes, I was told that 12 cows died on a farm close to the school fence. You know that we are not allowed on the campus right now; the school is closed. It will be a problem between the farmers and the Fulani,” he said, pleading anonymity.
