 U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday said that he would sign an Executive Order, putting a temporary halt on new immigration to the country for at least 60 days. He, however, said the measure was a means to shore up jobs for U.S. citizens amid the coronavirus pandemic. Trump said the measure was only applicable to those entering under the green card, the permit which gave full residence in the country, adding that there would be some exemptions. The move is the latest Trump measure restricting immigration to the U.S. including a sharp reduction in refugees and asylum seekers allowed into the country and a ban on most immigration from several countries. â€œI want to ensure U.S. citizens are first in line for jobs when the country re-opens from the coronavirus shutdown, otherwise, labour will be flown in from abroad.
