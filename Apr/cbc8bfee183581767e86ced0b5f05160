A Landlord in Coronavirus ravaged New York has cancelled this month’s rent for his tenants on account of the pandemic. Mario Salerno told the tenants via a notice he pasted at all of his 18 residential buildings in the borough to “STAY SAFE, HELP YOUR NEIGHBORS & WASH YOUR HANDS!!!” Eighty tenants are benefitting from the gesture. Salerno,59, who has about 200 to 300 tenants in total said it did not matter to him how much he would not be collecting on the 80 apartments. The coronavirus pandemic has brought life to a near standstill in New York City and cost man their jobs. Many tenants are therefore unable to pay their bills. He said: “My concern is everyone’s health. I told them just to look out for your neighbor and make sure that everyone has food on their table.” Salerno said a handful of his tenants messaged him last month saying that they could not afford rent. Three renters from Ireland packed up a few belongings and moved back home, he said.
