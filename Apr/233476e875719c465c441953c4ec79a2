 ONE hundred and twenty-five aircraft and 15 airports to be decontaminated across the country as part of measures to curb the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19) spread, the Federal Government said on Wednesday. Two of the aircraft have so far been decontaminated, Environment Minister Muhammad Mahmood said in Abuja during the daily briefing by members of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 Control. Explained why the slow place of the decontamination, Mahmood said: “Aviation sector is such a specialized sector. We cannot rush things. I did say that we have mapped out 125 aircraft and 13 airports. “So far, we have decontaminated and disinfected two aircraft. Why we are not rushing it is because of the nature of the industry. “It is a place that when it comes to safety, everything must be followed carefully, and even when we want to do that, we have to follow their lead as to how and where to go while decontaminating the aircraft. “For the airports, we need to be led on where we need to go, how and when we need to also. The decontamination is ongoing because there are other facilities that we are decontaminating across the country. So, we will go as soon as they are ready for us.”
