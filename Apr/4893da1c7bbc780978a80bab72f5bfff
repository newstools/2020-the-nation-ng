Veteran actor and broadcaster Sadiq Daba’s health is getting worse by the day and he is on the verge of losing one of his eyes. Daba’s health nosedived months after it was believed that he is fast recuperating. Four years ago, Daba was diagnosed with leukemia and prostate cancer. He was treated for the diseases after which he was later diagnosed with chronic obstructive venereal disease. In December 2019, an ailing Daba was honoured with an award at the Best of Nollywood Awards in Kano. The state governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, had also supported him with N1 million. The 68-year-old actor revealed the nature of his sickness in an interview with The Nation. He said, “What I suffer from is called chronic obstructive venereal disease. It has to do with my lungs. The inside is perforated, making breathing and walking around difficult.” In 2015, Daba won the Africa Movie Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as Inspector Waziri in Kunle Afolayan’s movie, October 1. In 2020, the actor joined Afolayan again for his upcoming film Citation.
