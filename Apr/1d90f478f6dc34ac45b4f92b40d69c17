Orilowo also disclosed that two patients still in the government isolation centre were doing very well. He said a total of 267 persons of interest were in the state out of which 52 have completed their isolation period. Nine persons, including Governor Seyi Makinde, have tested positive for the virus as at Saturday. Others included the Chief Medical Director (CMD) of the UCH Prof. Jesse Otegbayo; Provost, College of Medicine and his deputy. The three of them tested negative last week. The persons of interest are those that have had contact with the nine people who tested positive and other positive cases outside the state. On commencement of COVID-19 test in Ibadan, Orilowo said the UCH test centre started testing samples on Friday, stressing that samples were no longer being sent to Lagos.
