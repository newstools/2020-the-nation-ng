A businesswoman at Ikare Akoko who gave her name as Jumoke said the present situation in the country was an emergency period that demanded understanding between the government and the governed. She called for meaningful palliative measures as markets have been closed down adding that the economy in Akoko has become stagnant. Another victim, Mr. Kehinde John, who claims to be a fashion designer said the roof of her shop was blown off and the rain destroyed his machines and clothes.
