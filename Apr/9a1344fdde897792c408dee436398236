She spoke, while receiving on behalf of the state government, 200 mattresses donated by Mouka Foam, to support the state government. According to her, such donations are essential at a time the state government is making efforts to put in place necessary machineries for treatment and isolation of corona virus patients in the state. “Just yesterday Governor Dapo Abiodun took people around to show them the isolation centres that the government has built as part of his preparedness to manage the coronavirus pandemic. We were shown round very impressive 128 bed facility which we were told was the largest single facility available in country today in terms of the number of beds,’’ she said. According to her, “we also have another facility here in Abeokuta, that is a 100-bed facility and because we have seen the trend of this disease worldwide, that it tends to start from a little number and then it starts to grow exponentially. A lot of things are in place to slow down the growth so that we do not experience what others have experienced and also whatever provisions that we have to make going forward in case we experience the surge and we have to improve our capacity”.
