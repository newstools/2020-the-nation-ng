Ondo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, has said that the state is well equipped to treat the only COVID-19 patient it currently has. Governor Akeredolu said the patient would not be transferred to Lagos State. Speaking at a world press conference in Akure, Governor Akeredolu said the state’s own Infectious Disease Hospital where the patient is currently admitted has all the needed facilities. The Ondo Governor urged the people not to be scared as the patient did not leave the premises of a military barrack when he returned from Indian. Akeredolu stated that the military officer returned from Indian on an official assignment and was placed on self-isolation but developed symptoms on Friday which made his samples to be collected and tested positive. He said they have begun contact tracing and told those traced to self-isolate in the barracks. According to him, “We have moved the patient to our Infectious Disease Hospital (IDH). He has been receiving treatment and has been stable. “If you trace the history of the officer, it leaves us with little or no potential of expansion. The man came in from Indian and on his return placed himself on self-isolation. Whatever it is, all we have to do to prevent the spread has been done with this man being in self-isolation.”
