 THE Department of Security Services (DSS) has seized a number of contraband items following raids on many private houses in Adamawa State where the items were hidden. Items seized include 1,207 bags of foreign rice, 83 bags of sugar, 10 jerry cans of vegetable oil, and 58 bottles of energy drinks. The seizures were a result of collaboration between the DSS and Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in their effort to ensure the success of Federal Government’s diversification of Nigeria’s economy from oil. CBN branch controller in Yola, Mr. Jatau Sadu, said, “We all know the efforts of the federal government in diversifying the economic base of the country especially from crude oil dependent economy to a more comparatively advantageous resource in agriculture,” Jatau said. He noted that in view of Nigeria’s vast porous borders and the scant number of customs operatives to man them, the partnership with the DSS became imperative.
