A group has created an emergency response app to assist the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), and the Police in reporting cases and symptoms of COVID-19 in the country. The free app, ‘PrimeAlert’, is expected to enable Nigerians report any suspected case or anybody with virus symptoms. Chief Executive Officer ‘PrimeAlert’, Tony Nwulu, spoke in a statement yesterday in Abuja. He said the gesture was aimed at supporting the government as part of its contribution to curb spread of coronavirus.
