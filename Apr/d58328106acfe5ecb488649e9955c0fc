Ahead of the release of their debut EP, Worship Kulture, a contemporary inspirational outreach initiative, dedicated to publishing gospel music to the world, has released two new singles, ‘Farahan’ and ‘Yahweh’. The group, which explores different sounds through various artists, released the upbeat, crossover Afro-pop, gospel track ‘Farahan’ off their self titled EP, scheduled for April 17 release. Farahan’ is an upbeat, contemporary Gospel song embracing the philosophy of traditional gospel but mixing it up with cool and edgy Afro-pop beats and rhythms. It’s a song bound to get you smiling and tapping your feet. The song is essentially an ode to how God’s promise is spread to all in the band and the world. The debut single ‘Farahan’ was composed by FSC Sanni and Jmon, produced by Orlando and performed by Chris and Jmon). Worship Kulture was created by FSC Sanni (a producer/record executive) to promote contemporary African gospel music into mainstream media. Worship Kulture is made up of various artists and producers from different countries and cultural backgrounds such as South Africa, Congo, Nigeria, Zimbabwe and Angola who all worked on the upcoming project titled: ‘Word on Worship’. The lead singers on ‘Word of Worship’ are Chris & Emmanuel. They each bring a unique sound to the project, in both composition and production. Chris focuses more on the Afro-pop category while Emmanuel leads the more “traditional” gospel worship category. “I had been following Chris’s music for a while and could see how he was able to transfer all his emotion into the production. The songs are very much needed to enrich our faith in God especially as the world is facing Coronavirus at the moment”, said a very prominent pastor in South Africa. The group’s first EP will be available on all major digital music platform on April 17, 2020, or online, on the group’s website https://worshipkulture.com
