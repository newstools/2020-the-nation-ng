The National Youths Service Corps (NYSC) in Anambra State said it has established a garment factory for the production of facemasks and other protective kits. State Coordinator Kehinde Aremu spoke during presentation of sanitisers and washers to the state as part of corps members’ support in the fight against the pandemic on Monday. He said the items, produced under the skill acquisition and entrepreneurial development programme, was also another way of appreciating the hospitality shown to them by the government and the people. Aremu said they would produce millions of facemasks if provided with materials and assistance. He said, “We have set up garment factory at Mgbakwu, Awka North Local Government Area of the state to produce thousands of face masks in the first instance before venturing into other products, including corps members’ uniforms, using corps members and local materials.
