  MINISTER of State, Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo, had in a tweet on his official twitter page shared lessons learned from the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pandemic. According to the minister, one of the major lessons is that COVID-19 has reechoed the fact that survival is common to humanity, no matter the race. He explained that the disease has reminded people and nations across the world that everything that causes division among a people is not important. Keyamo tweeted, “the greatest lesson of COVID-19 is that it has blurred all the irrelevant differences of mankind which are politics, tribe and religion. “It has slapped our brains back to reset mode and teaches us that the essence of life is about our common humanity and our common survival as a race.”
