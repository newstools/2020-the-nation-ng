 Bayelsa State receives between N9 billion and N10 billion monthly as federal allocation, Governor Douye Diri’s Acting Chief Press Secretary Daniel Alabrah has clarified. He said a report quoting the governor as saying that “the average montly bill of Bayelsa is between N9 billion and N10 billion” is not correct.  Alabrah said: “For the records, this information is incorrect as the governor was inadvertently misquoted. That sentence or quote ought to have read: “the average MONTHLY ALLOCATON OF BAYELSA IS BETWEEN N9B AND N10B” and not the monthly wage bill. It is our assumption that the error could have occurred during transcription of what the governor said on Friday, March 6, 2020 when he had an interactive session with reporters in Lagos. Please accept the assurances and esteemed regards of His Excellency.
