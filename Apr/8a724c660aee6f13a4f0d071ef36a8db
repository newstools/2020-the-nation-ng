Justina Asishana, Minna  Niger state government has concluded the tracing of 53 people who had possible contact with the confirmed COVID-19 case in Limawa Area of Niger state. These people, according to the Secretary to the Niger State Government who is the Chairman of the Taskforce on COVID-19 in the state, Ahmed Matane, were being quarantined because the COVID-19 confirmed case had been in contact with them after he was released from the hospital. Speaking on a radio program in Minna, Matane explained that the confirmed case was released from the isolation center after his return from Lagos because he showed no symptoms of the infection. “When the announcement was made by the NCDC, Niger state did not know who exactly had the infection because we had about four samples with the NCDC, so when the announcement came, we had to link up with the NCDC to know which of the index number had the case and that was when the data was given about the man in Limawa and we had to go and pick him up. The SSG further said that there are two other cases with the NCDC and they are awaiting the result of the samples stating that the mistake made in the first case will not be repeated in the other cases as the patients will not be released until after the results are gotten from the NCDC. “In addition to the confirmed COVID-19 confirmed case, we have two other cases whose sample results have not returned from NCDC. We also have about 30 people in the Minna social rehabilitation center on isolation.” Matane stated that the contacts are under close monitoring and observation for any symptomatic behaviour with a timeframe of 14 days quarantine for the 53 contacts known as community Quarantine. The entire Limawa Area is also on special watch by the state COVID-19 taskforce due to suspicions that the confirmed case may have had more contacts than the 53 contacts under observation.
