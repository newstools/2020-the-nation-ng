Kwara State Government will tomorrow begin a review of its 2020 budget. This will involve heads of ministries and is a step designed to rework the N162 billion budget to align with the current global economic realities. The budget had, among other fundamentals, been predicated on $57 per barrel of oil, but Nigeriaâ€™s Brent Crude traded at around $20 as at Wednesday afternoon, owing in part to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Commissioner for Finance and Planning Mrs. Oyeyemi Olasumbo Florence said in a statement that the review sessions would hold at her ministry and would be staggered to avoid overcrowding in line with the COVID-19 safety protocols. She said each session would feature the commissioner, permanent secretary, director of personnel finance and supply (DPFS), director planning and research and statistics (DPRS), and controller finance and account (CFA) of the affected ministries or agencies who are to attend sessions with relevant documents. The statement said the MDAs are to check the scheduled timetable already forwarded to them to confirm the date and time of their appearance. The review sessions will hold daily (including during weekends) from April 24 to 29.
