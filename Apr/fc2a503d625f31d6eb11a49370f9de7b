Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq has urged Muslims to pray to Allah to shower save the world from all afflictions like COVID-19. The governor enjoined the Muslims to remain true to the dictates of Ramadan. In a statement by his Chief Press Secretary Rafiu Ajakaye, AbdulRazaq wished the Muslim ummah a very rewarding fasting season. He said: “I fully appreciate the fact that this is a peculiar moment for all of humanity during which movement is restrained to contain the spread of COVID-19 in the interest of everyone.  I call for the understanding of all at this time, especially the Muslim community whose special acts of worship during Ramadan are affected by the restrictions on movement and public gatherings. “I am consoled however by the fact that history is replete with examples of the best of the Muslim generations having to suspend group activities on safety grounds. Let us have our Sahur and Iftar in conditions that would not spread the virus and endanger ourselves and others.”
