 The Adamawa Police Command has confirmed a clash between some youths and COVID-19 Joint Task Force at Damilu area in Yola North Local Government Area of the state. DSP Sulaiman Nguroje, the Spokesperson of the command, confirmed the development to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Friday in Yola. Nguroje said that the elements defied government lockdown order and arrived Damilu Mosque to observe Friday congregation. “We are on patrol to monitor the lockdown order compliance when we received a distress call that there was suspected unrest around Damilu Juma’at Mosque. “So, we rushed to the scene and on getting there, we met some youths shouting ‘Allahu Akbar’, causing panic and scaring people. “We try to find out what is happening and we learnt that the Imam of the Mosque told the congregation to disperse because there won’t be Juma’at prayer. “So we were able to contain the situation and no one was injured or arrested,” Nguroje said. However, an eye witness, Mr Haruna Bello, told NAN that the incident occurred at about 2 p.m when Muslim faithful were observing Friday congregation. Bello said they were observing the prayer when heavy armed security operatives stormed the Mosque and dispersed them. “The security shot into the air to scare us and we all ran for cover, ” Bello said. He claimed that many worshippers sustained injuries. (NAN)
