Bank customers in the ancient city of Kano have been been unable to withdraw or transfer following the closure of banks despite their exemption by Federal Government from the lockdown orders on some states. The situation created unusual long queues at ATM points in the state as residents jostled to make withdrawals in the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of them told our correspondent they needed cash for the forthcoming Easter celebration. It was gathered that the banks had to shut their gates against customers as part of preventive measures to check the spread of COVID-19. A custormer, Mrs. Agnes Moses told The Nation: “l have been here for over seven hours with the hope of withdrawing N5,000 to feed our family. To my surprise, the banks are under lock and key! My efforts to withdraw the little sum was not possible as their is no network at the ATM point. All I keep on seeing was that the ATM is out of cash. Now, my situation is pathetic.” A bank worker, who pleaded not to be mentioned, told The Nation: “Banks in Kano have closed down and my advice for our customers is to use their ATM cards for their transactions.”
