Delta State Governor Ifeanyi Okowa has declared a 14-days extension of the COVID-19 lockdown as part of efforts to contain the spread of the disease in the state. Okowa in a state-wide broadcast on Tuesday also imposed, beginning from today, a dusk-to-dawn curfew across the state. According to him, the two weeks extension is to enable officials track, identify, isolate and test all who have had contact with the three confirmed cases in the state. “I hereby extend the stay-at-home order for a period of two weeks. It is for public good and for the interest of our health. And I want to urge all Deltans to please observe the stay-at-home order,” Okowa stated.
