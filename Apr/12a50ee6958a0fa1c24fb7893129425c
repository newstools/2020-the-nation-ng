 ONDO State Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has vowed to prosecute and punish erring pastors for flouting his directives against holding church service on Easter Sunday. He said social distancing remained the only way to curb Coronavirus (COVID-19) spread. The governor who had earlier asked churches to hold services on Easter day rescinded his decision when a second COVID-19 case was confirmed in the state. Some pastors were caught holding services in some remote areas of the state by the State Monitoring Committee on COVID-19. Five churches have been shut for violating the governor’s directive. The erring clerics locked up their congregation but the the taskforce team forced the door open and met worshippers inside. One of the pastors was said to have scaled the fence but he was eventually caught. Akeredolu spoke through his Senior Special Assistant on Special Duties and Strategies, Dr. Doyin Odebowale,who led the task force to enforce compliance. Churches within the Akure metropolis and Ondo town complied but services held in churches like Christ Apostolic Church, Oke-Lisa and (TAJEM) Irese, Assemblies of God Church, Olufoam and Gospel Church Ministry, Irese. Worshippers in many of the churches ran away to avoid being arrested and some claimed ignorance of the governor’s directive. Odebowale, who that said those arrested will be prosecuted, noted it was bad for religious leaders to disobey state government orders.
