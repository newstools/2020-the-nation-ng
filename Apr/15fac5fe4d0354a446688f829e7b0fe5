Multiple awards winning singer, David ‘Davido’ Adeleke has said that going into active politics in Nigeria will not be a problem for him. The father of three made this known while responding to a tweet from his fan on Twitter who said he won’t survive two weeks in the murky waters of politics. “Davido just two weeks in politics body go tell u, u think to say na studio to compose song, u are playing with what is bigger than you, have u seen ur mate in politics,” the Twitter user wrote. Responding to the Twitter user, Davido wrote, “Nigerian entertainment is the biggest thing to come out of Nigeria … I don’t think politics will be a problem.” Davido was one of the top singers, who were very vocal during the last general election. Davido threw his weight behind his uncle, Senator Ademola Adeleke and even performed at political rallies in Osun State. The singer had also met with the Peoples Democratic Party’s presidential flagbearer, Atiku Abukar with his fiancee. Davido had been quite critical of the current political dispensation under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari.
