 Toyin Abraham has joined several celebrities and notable Nigerians to donate food relief items to people across the states affected by COVID-19. Abraham, in a video, had distributed livestock and food items to some elders, widows and single parents living in Osun State. The donation, which was made by Abraham, was facilitated for distribution by Chief Agbabiaka.   The surprise donation had the actress and producer distributing rice, chickens, sanitizers, and a sum of money. The beneficiaries, in turn, prayed for Abraham for deeming them worthy of such gifts.  Abraham had been sensitising her fans and 4.6 million followers on Instagram on the need to remain informed and curb the spread of coronavirus. Recently, the ‘Fate of Alakada’ actress joined a long list of celebrities endorsing Ibukun Awosika’s citizen for citizen initiative which aims at getting relief packages to Nigerians during the lockdown to battle coronavirus.
