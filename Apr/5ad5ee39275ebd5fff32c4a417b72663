By Omolola Afolabi  A doctor in the frontline of the COVID-19 treatment at the Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital, Edo State, has contracted the disease, the President of the National Association of Resident Doctors, Dr. Aliyu Sokomba, has confirmed. Sokomba revealed this on Channels Television’s daily magazine programme “Sunrise Daily” and in a series of tweet by the doctor’s colleagues on Twitter. Sokomba said six doctors had died of Lassa fever while one unnamed doctor had been infected with COVID-19. He said, “At the moment, as health workers continue to play their part in containing the spread of the disease, the health workers are not protected. One of our colleagues died just yesterday from Lassa fever. This is the state of our health care institutions and that is the fate of most health care workers in the country. According to him, Dr. Philp Dzuana is the sixth doctor to have died of Lassa fever in the country and very little is being done to getting this kind of situation under control”. “Just yesterday again, one of our doctors in Irrua Specialist Hospital Irrua Edo State had tested positive for the COVID-19 disease. What that means is that these doctors that are testing positive to various diseases are being left alone to take care of themselves. He continued: “There is no form of life insurance for them. There is no form of compensation. To say the least, what these doctors benefit at the end of every month as hazard allowance is N5, 0000. So, we are worried that if victory against COVID-19, Lassa fever outbreak in the country is to be achieved, the welfare and wellbeing of doctors and other health workers who are on the frontline must be secured.”
