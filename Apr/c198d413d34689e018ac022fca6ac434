Leicester City midfielder Wilfried Ndidi has ruled out summer exit insisting he is happy at King Power Stadium. Ndidi was in excellent form before the Premier League was suspended due to the spread of coronavirus. His performance saw him linked with a number of clubs including Manchester United. However, the 23-year-old has been quick to play down any transfer talk.  “I still have a contract with Leicester. I am learning and trying to improve myself every day and I am doing OK here, so no need to go anywhere,” he said. Since his move to Leicester from Belgian side Genk in 2017, Ndidi has been one of the best defensive midfielders. The Nigerian has been a key player for the Foxes so far this season, helping Brendan Rodgers’ men to move third on the log.
