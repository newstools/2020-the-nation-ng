As the coronavirus cases spike across the country, the Nigeria private sector, through CACOVID, has pooled resources together to fight the menace alongside government. They disclosed this in a statement at the weekend. The initiative, which is being led by top industry giants, has a sole objective- eradicating the spread of the coronavirus in Nigeria. CACOVID saud it was motivated by the collective desire to protect and preserve humanity and to fight the spread of coronavirus in Nigeria. It will work to fight COVID-19 by raising public awareness, supporting healthcare professionals, institutions and governments, and by mobilizing private-sector leadership and resources. As part of these efforts, they will build fully-equipped medical tents as testing, isolation, treatment and training centres as well as recruit personnel who will tend to the sick. These activities are in full swing to ensure the facilities are completed on time to meet the growing population needs.  The initiative is made up of different component parts, which work together towards the objective. These include the funding committee, which is responsible for funding and raising funds for the efforts, the technical committee which is responsible for intellectual leadership around testing issues, treatment protocols, isolation centres, amongst others and the Operational Committee which is responsible for project management, logistics and communication.
