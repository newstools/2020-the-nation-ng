By Adebisi Onanuga  Scores of journalists who thronged Ogba Magistrates Court to cover the trial of popular musician Azeez Fashola aka Naira Marley were on Wednesday barred. Naira Marley and former Lagos gubernatorial aspirant Gbolahan Gbadamosi and wife were being arraigned for attending the 43rd birthday organised by Nollywood actress Funke Akindele for her husband, which contravened Lagos State Government directive on social gathering. Police kept tight security at the two gates of the court. The defendants were brought into the court at about 11.00 am in a police van. Only Channels Television crew was allowed to go inside the court 30 minutes after the defendants were brought in. As at press time other journalists from broadcast stations and print who came in around 10.00am were still locked outside as at 11.45 am. Details shortlyâ€¦
