The Federal Government has launched an investigation into the alleged abuse and maltreatment of Nigerians in China since the outbreak of Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The alleged attacks and abuse of Nigerians in the Guangdong region over the handling, test and treatment of COVID-19 patients, an allegation the Chinese government denied. Foreign Affairs Minister Geoffrey Onyeama confirmed that the investigation has commenced. “Our Consulate in Guangzhou has started,” he confirmed to inquiries on the investigation by the Federal Government. A source close to Onyeama disclosed that the head of the Nigeria Embassy in Beijing has been directed to launch the immediate investigations into the allegations to advise the government on the next line of action. The source said: “I can authoritative tell you that the Nigerian government is investigating the alleged attacks on Nigerians by Chinese in Guangzhou. “The government really wants to get the actual position from the Chinese and Nigerian Embassy in China. If it is true that Nigerians were really attacked and discriminated against in China because of Covid-19, the government would like to know and then decide on the next line of action. As a government, we do not want to act on hearsay but fact.” But the Chinese Embassy in Nigeria has rejected the claims of maltreatment of Nigerians resident in China by its authorities. It said that the country has zero tolerance to discrimination. The Embassy said in a statement: “We treat all foreign nationals equally in China. We reject differential treatment and have zero tolerance for discrimination. To prevent and control the pandemic, we need understanding, support and cooperation from both Chinese and foreign nationals in China and urge all foreign nationals in China to strictly observe local anti-epidemic regulations.”
