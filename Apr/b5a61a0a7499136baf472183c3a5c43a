A group known as Project Ark has donated relief materials, such as cash, food, soaps, hand sanitisers to over 3000 families in Lagos State and sensitised them about the hygiene guidelines to prevent spread of COVID-19. According to the Visionary of Reformers Arise Network and member of Board of Trustees of the Project Ark Alero Ayida-Otobo, Project Ark was put together in response to the initial shutdown announced by Lagos State to curtail spread of COVID-19. Identifying that 65 per cent of Lagosians live in slum settlements and are daily wage earners, Project Ark was developed as a technology-enabled solution for getting food to those who need it during this COVID-19 period and even beyond. She said the vision of the group is to build a platform that connects people who have with those who are in need so that no one goes hungry. Designed to enhance collaboration among the different parties currently working in silos and in partnership with the Lagos State Government, the Project Ark initiative will involve a systematic process for collection, repackaging and distribution of food items to those in need within communities across Lagos State.
