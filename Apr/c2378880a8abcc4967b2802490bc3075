 Nigerian singer Kinsolo has recently released his much anticipated extended play (EP) entitled Kinsolo 2. Kinsolo describes the fresh EP as a continuation of a story from his previous project Kinsolo 1. Speaking on the freshly released project, Kinsolo said it is all about a young king. “This is the story of a young king named Kinsolo, and it chronicles his journey as he rules over his kingdom, which is titled Grooveland. He has many adventures, meets many beautiful women, falls in love many times, and fights many battles,” he said. The seven-track EP has collaborations with Buju, Prettyboydo and Foster Ebayy . In his words, “All songs are bangers, I can categorically tell you that there are way more collaborative slappers where those came from”. Formerly known as Mars, the Oluwa Nagode crooner describes his genre of music as happy music.  “I make happy music. I make music to better your mood. Whether you just woke up, or you’re cooking, or doing laundry, or having a party, I want you to turn on Kinsolo and brighten up. In the shower, in your bedroom, anywhere. You don’t even have to dance physically if that’s not your style. You can vibe in your head if that’s your thing. Just vibe sha. Even when it’s a slow, R&B song, I want you to take the happiness from it”. said Kinsolo. On how he hopes to find his space in the saturated Nigerian music scene with his style of music, the Forlana Record signed artist said “Good music is always going to find its way to the limelight if it sticks around long enough. I have seen it work for many people and it’s going to work for me too. I intend to put my head down, put out the music and do the necessary work, and let the fans decide the rest.”
