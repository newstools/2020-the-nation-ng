The Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has temporarily relaxed the restrictions on large religious gatherings to enable Christians carry out their religious obligations during the Easter period. Wike in a statewide broadcast said the directive also permitted the Muslim community to observe their Jumaat Prayers within the period. He said: “In the spirit of Easter, therefore, and after a careful review of the state of COVID 19 situation in our state, all Muslim faithful should observe Juma’at prayers in their mosques or prayer grounds throughout the State and pray for the peace, forgiveness and the blessings of Allah upon the State. “All Christians should have Easter Church Services with their full congregation and pray to God to forgive us of our sins, continue to intervene in our affairs and protect the State and our people from the Coronavirus. “For the avoidance of doubt, the relaxation on mass religious gathering is limited only to the afore-mentioned respective dates. “All other restrictions, including the closure of markets, night-clubs, cinemas, beer parlours, public burials, weddings, parks as well as the closure of our air, land, and sea routes into the State, shall remain in force until further notice. “Most of these measures, including the restrictions on religious assemblies above fifty persons, were targeted at avoiding comingling, maintaining social distancing and ensuring that the State and its citizens are free from COVID 19.  From all assessments, it is going well with our State and we are grateful to God for His mercies and protection. “We are also grateful for the strong public support and I just want to say thank you for your kind understanding in the midst of the troubles you are made to endure at these trying times.”
