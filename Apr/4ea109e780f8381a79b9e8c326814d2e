Harry Kane has decided that he would rather move to Man United over Real Madrid if he moved away from Tottenham, according to reports. Kane could be involved in one of the biggest transfer stories of the summer, with his future at Tottenham far from guaranteed after he admitted he would not stay with them “for the sake of it” if they were not showing signs of progressing to match his ambition. The England captain has been criticised by some for those comments, but he may have a better chance of winning trophies elsewhere, with Manchester United potentially giving him the platform from which to achieve more honours. And according to Bleacher Report, Kane has now decided that if he was to leave Spurs, then Old Trafford would be his preferred destination instead of Real Madrid, who are also interested in a big-money signing. The 26-year-old is valued at around £200m, a world-record transfer fee, which would make him available only to the richest clubs in the world, such as Man Utd and Madrid.
