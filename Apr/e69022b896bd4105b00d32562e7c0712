 Mr Kamil Akinlabi, Chairman, Oyo State Road Maintenance Agency (OYSROMA), has warned community vigilantes and other people to desist from burning tyres on the roads across the state. In a statement issued in Ibadan on Tuesday, Akinlabi noted that burning tyres on the roads usually created room for water to penetrate such roads, thus creating potholes. He said the act would destroy the asphaltic layer of the roads, weaken them and shorten their lifespan. “This has constituted additional problems, as some of the roads that we have recently rehabilitated or reconstructed are being spoilt by this act,” he said. Akinlabi said that government was aware of the sacrifices being made by the people, particularly on the security challenges in some areas within the state, which had necessitated the burning of tyres on the roads. He, however, said that such acts would only create additional problems on such roads. The OYSROMA chairman, therefore, called on the people of the state to desist from the act, saying that roads and other government facilities should be protected for the benefit of all. He enjoined the people of the state to stay safe and continue to be law abiding, especially during this challenging period of the COVID-19 pandemic. (NAN)
