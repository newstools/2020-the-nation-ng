 The Ogun State Government has rolled out a mobile application for the public to self-assess themselves on individually for the dreaded coronavirus. The state had last month launched a real-time concurrently updated mobile application for health workers, which has been deployed to  government and private health facilities across the 20 local government areas to aid information sharing. In a statement by the Commissioner for Health, Dr. Tomi Coker, the new application, christened, “Ogun COVID-19 Assessment,” is not for diagnostic purpose; it is meant to determine the risk of resident’s exposure to the disease. Coker noted that the application is downloadable on Google play store and can also be assessed on https://covid19.ogunhip.com/ and https://covid19.ogunstate.gov.ng/  She said responses are monitored on a dashboard at the state ministry of health, which will flag high risk individuals as red and promptly followed up by the state epidemiologist. “This mobile application is an assessment tool for the individual members of the public on the basic symptoms of coronavirus. It can be downloaded on google play store. The app is not for diagnostic purpose. Responses are monitored on a dashboard at the ministry of health which will flag high risk individuals as red who are promptly followed up by the State Epidemiologist,” Coker said. Urging the public to take advantage of the mobile application, the Commissioner assured that Governor Dapo Abiodun is putting measures in place to contain the disease.
