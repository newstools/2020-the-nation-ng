Operatives of the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) in Lagos have impounded 13 vehicles in Alapere for not complying with the Federal Government’s stay-at-home order. The officers also dispersed over 150 youths exercising in Ketu-Alapere. Led by its Commander, DCP Olatunji Disu, the vehicles, which included three cars, seven buses and three four-wheel drives were caught using their vehicles to convey passengers and were without valid excuses for being on the road during the lockdown. The Commander directed his men to disperse over 150 youths who converged on Samuel Gbadebo Adegboyega Village beside The Apostolic Church, Alapere. Some of the youths, who claimed to be residents of the area, were exercising before the police got to the area. After being addressed on the essence of the government’s order, some of the youths still refused to go home until the RRS Commander directed his officers to form a wall, walked the youth down the road before eventually dispersing them. While vehicles with valid excuses and identifications were allowed passage, some drivers whose buses  were arrested, said that they were heading to Ibadan with their passengers. All the vehicles have been handed over to Alapere Divisional Police Station.
