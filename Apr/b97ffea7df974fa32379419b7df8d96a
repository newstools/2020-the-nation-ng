The name Effiom Bassey Effiom may not readily ring a bell in other parts of the country but in Calabar, the state capital of Cross River State and its environs, Effiom popularly known as Effiom Trombone is a household name. From the outset, Effiom had always wanted to be a musician. From the Hope Waddell Training Institution where he learned and honed his musical talents before proceeding to The Polytechnic Calabar to study Secretarial Studies, the story remains the same. He never for one day abandoned music while there. His years of hard work paid off when in 2011, he dropped his debut album ‘Eyen Calabar’ which was also the title of his hit track that shot him to fame. He is currently promoting his new single, ‘Ikwo Calabar’ with plans in the kitty for a video. As an enterprising and industrious young man, Effiom who is a highlife performing and recording artist founded the Paradise Music Festival and Awards to recognise the efforts of musical talents and celebrate them. The revered award is now in its fifth edition. Effiom Trombone is reported to be the head of the biggest live band in the state, the South-Central Band. These and more earned him awards and the trust of the Cross River State government, that they have for years saddled him with the responsibility of Stage/Artistes Management of the annual Calabar Festival. Currently, he is the Special Assistant to Governor Ben Ayade on Entertainment and a leader of Ayade Band, responsible for the music needs of His Excellency at state and personal functions.
