 LAGOS State Government has impounded 20 vehicles and 15 motorbikes for violating the lockdown order. Worried by non-compliance with the lockdown order by motorists, an Enforcement Team comprised of officials of the Task Force, State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA),  Police officers and men from the Ministry of Transportation visited Ikorodu road, Ojota, Jibowu, Ebute-Metta, Otto and Iddo corridor among other places on Saturday to enforce the directives. Special Adviser to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Transportation, Toyin Fayinka, who led the operation, said the enforcement was effected to stem down the rising spread of the community-based Coronavirus. The impounded vehicles and motorbikes, he said, have been taken to the LASTMA yard. He said: “Some of the impounded vehicles included some interstate passengers loaded commuter buses belonging to some transport companies at Jibowu. Others are IVECO truck, Volvo truck, KIA Salon car, Siena Space bus as well as Yellow buses popularly called Danfo among others. Fayinka warned residents to obey the stay-at-home order and imbibe personal hygiene to support the government daily efforts in curbing the spread of the contagious virus. The Special Adviser explained that it was worrisome that Lagos State alone recorded as much as 80 numbers of confirmed cases as at the last count, stressing that there is the need to strengthen enforcement of stay-at-home order in the interest of the public. According to him, the support and cooperation of the residents are required to succeed in the fight against COVID-19. The impounded vehicles and motorbikes, he said, would not be released until after the lockdown. Fayinka frowned at the involvement of some law enforcement agents that were among the lockdown violators. He said the government would not hesitate to enforce the law on any individual or group that attempts to frustrate the on-going efforts at eradicating the spread of the Coronavirus.
