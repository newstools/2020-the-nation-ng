Simba Group, the distributor of TVS tricycles, has begun the distribution of safety and hygiene packs to commercial tricycle riders as part of its effort to support the transport sector. The company is giving out hand sanitisers and face masks to thousands of riders to protect them and their passengers from the spread of Coronavirus. Its firm’s representatives, in collaboration with state governments, held restricted-access handover ceremonies, in line with suggested social distancing practices, to donate such packs to Keke riders through their representatives. Simba’s representative Peter Mamza said: “More and more people are turning to Keke for their transportation needs in this challenging time due to its inherent advantages as they carry only limited passengers at a time and are very well ventilated.  “We want to ensure that the rider community has access to these products, which will not only keep them safe, but enable them continue their livelihoods in areas where movement restrictions are not yet in place. We hope that by wearing masks, and reducing the potential spread of the virus, they will further benefit the society.” The Simba Group has been operating in Nigeria for over 30 years and has contributed to the economy through its portfolio of widely recognised brands and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives.
