 A NON-governmental organisation (NGO), Face of Surulere, has donated food items to persons above 65 years in Surulere, Lagos. The beneficiaries, including 95-year-old Chief Imam of Oladimejj Mosque, Alhaji Sheu Sanusi, and 82-year-old Pa Olufunsho Marcus, received the items last Sunday and Monday. Face of Surulere, whose membership include Surulere indigenes home and abroad, said the gesture would aid compliance with President Muhammadu Buhari’s lockdown directive. The organisation’s president in Nigeria, Mr. Fatai Disu, said it was one of the ways of paying back to their ‘fathers and mothers’ who natured them in the community. Receiving the items, Alhaji Sanusi, who described the donation as timely, commended the group “for having old people in mind.” For Pa. Marcus, the donation was in keeping with the spirit of togetherness.
