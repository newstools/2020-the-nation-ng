While a governor is imposing life ban on journalists, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) is waiting in the wing in the next three years for him over N400million slush funds allegedly linked to the 2015 presidential campaign of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Out of the N400million, about N100million was traced to a foundation in which the horse-whip CEO allegedly has interest. A humorous EFCC operative said: “There is no immunity for life; we are waiting for His Excellency for interaction in three years’ time. We have already quizzed three suspects, including a brother of the affected governor.” So, who will laugh last? The governor or the hounded journalists?
