The coordinator, No Alternative To Buhari-Osinbajo 2019 (NATBO 2019), Vincent Uba, has condemned the blame game of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) at a time the world is being ravaged by the corona virus pandemic. Uba is surprised that as countries adopt measures to curb Corona virus, ” it is surprising and unfortunate that the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has resorted to negative blame games.” Speaking on the views credited to the National Publicity Secretary of PDP in the Sunday Punch newspapers of 29th March, 2020 to the effect that the President Muhammadu Buhari’s government should be blamed for corona virus, he described it as ‘callous and heinous, adding that “this is a case of deceitfully “calling a dog a bad name in order to hang it and then to curry unmerited attention.” The NATBO national coordinator wondered how would a reasonable person or group of persons in this critical time in global history, politicize a worldwide pandemic, when in virtually all the countries of the world, the citizens, religious, business, political organizations etc, unite to rally round their governments, praying to curb this menace called corana virus. “Let it be said and known that it is a patriotic duty and civic responsibility for anyone (individual or group) to offer suggestions/pieces of advice to the government on how best to tackle the pandemic. “Doing so does not necessarily mean you have to blow your trumpet and assume you are the only one involved.” He said the country, with the co-operation and assistance of ministries, agencies, state governments and Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs), was doing the best it could to curtail the COVID-19 pandemic.
