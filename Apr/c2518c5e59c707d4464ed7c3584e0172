 MS. Ajani Oluwatobi, a family health expert, has said that unless adequate measures are in place, the lockdown occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic will expose Nigerian women to high risk of rape and unwanted pregnancies. Oluwatobi told newsmen in Asaba, Delta State, that during the lockdown, women especially young ones are exposed to unscrupulous, idle men. Oluwatobi is the Family Planning 2020 (FP2020) Youth Focal Point, Nigeria for Development Communications (DevComs) Network and Nigerian Urban Reproductive Health Initiative (NURHI II).
