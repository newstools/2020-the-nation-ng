 THIS is not the best of time for the former Chairman of the Special Investigation Panel on Recovery of Public Property, Okoi Obono-Obla, who was arrested a, week ago by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences (ICPC). It is a reversal of roles for a man, who commandeered a huge team of policemen to arrest suspects some years ago. The latest news is that Obla has not been able to meet the bail terms offered by a court. While he is battling to ask the court to vary the bail terms, his case is worsened by the lockdown in the country. To comply with due process, ICPC secured a 14-day extension of the order for his detention. But Obla has taken to social media to protest against the “legal quarantine.”  He has alleged maltreatment, he complained of being hypertensive and he said he has been overwhelmed by fears of COVID-19. Unknown to many, ICPC has been giving him egg treatment. Apart from a cosy detention cell, the anti-graft agency assigned operatives to pick up his wife twice a day from home to bring his meals. He was also taken to the nearby National Hospital, Abuja for health check. But Obla does not care about the comfort in ICPC cell. He wants to be released despite a subsisting court order and without meeting bail terms.
