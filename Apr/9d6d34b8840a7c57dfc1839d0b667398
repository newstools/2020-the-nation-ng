 THE Johnson’ actress Ada Ameh has called on the Federal Government to make electricity available for people as they observe the mandatory lockdown occasioned by the coronavirus pandemic. Ameh who became teary in a short video lamented that the least the government can do to assist the people is to provide basic amenities of which electricity is essential to help people store food in their fridges. Hear her: “What kind of country is this? Why can’t the government provide simple things as power for people? Everywhere is noisy. Generators everywhere disturbing everybody.  If the generators pack up who will repair them? People can hardly feed without Coronavirus, now it is worse, yet you want them to stay home. We understand but what palliative have you put in place for them? Let them at least save little foodstuff that they would eat. Some of us can afford to feed ourselves what of others? Please provide light for us so that the children can also watch television and people will comfortably stay at home.”
