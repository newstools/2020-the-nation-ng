Some prominent preachers have disagreed with founder of Christ Embassy, Pastor Chris Oyakhilome over his claims on 5G network. Oyakhilome, in a viral video, stated that the lockdown was to enable the Federal Government install 5G in Abuja and Lagos. According to him: “The Federal Government was pushed to lockdown Abuja and Lagos specifically because of 5G in Abuja and Lagos. “They had already tested 5G in Abuja and now they are digging in Lagos to get it ready. “That is why they locked down Abuja and Lagos so that the 5G can be installed.” But founder of Kingsway International Christian Centre(KICC) London, described Oyakilome’s claims of a link between the 5G network, coronavirus and anti-Christ as “foolish theories.” Senior Pastor of The Covenant Nation, Poju Oyemade and founder of Daystar Christian Centre Pastor Sam Adeyemi, in a live Instagram teaching, faulted Oyakilome’s theory. Adeyemi stated the coronavirus pandemic is not the only situation that crippled activities, including the closure of mosques, churches and schools. “Some leaders are giving extreme interpretations to the crisis. ” I studied the last global pandemic before COVID-19 to get the right perspective,” he stated. He affirmed that mosques, schools and markets were shut in Nigeria during the influenza pandemic, which hit the world in 1918. But President of Omega Fire Ministries Worldwide, Apostle Johnson Suleman, warned critics of Oyakhilome against ‘name-calling’. In series of tweet, Suleman said: “I see many people online attacking Pastor Chris Oyakhilome. If you have contrary opinion, state it clearly so you can be listened to or keep quiet,” he said. “Insults, name-calling, character assassination are all proofs that you have nothing to say.”
