Two volunteers, Engr. Williams Gyang and Nura Jibrin, have repaired two ventilators in the Jos University Teaching Hospital (JUTH), as part of their humanitarian service to combat COVID-19 in Plateau. Speaking to newsmen at the hospital premises on Thursday in Jos, Gyang said the gesture was premised on the critical function of a ventilator in the treatment of COVID-19 cases, saying the hospital has shortage of the equipment and required urgent repairs of damaged ones. He said he was interested in fabricating the ventilator when he heard countries stressing the need to get more of the equipment to reduce the disease death rate. “The outcry is bad, people are dying, We need to begin to harness our potentials in Nigeria by supporting talents in the country in researches for inventions in the country. “I did not do it with my friend to be paid, I can’t collect money and then sit down and watch people dying, it is a humanitarian service to assist,” he said. Gyang explained that he assessed the ventilators and discovered they can be fixed and so invited his childhood friend who attended Technical College, Jos, with him, which resulted to its success.
