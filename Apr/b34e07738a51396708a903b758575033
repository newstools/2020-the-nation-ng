Nigerian upstream oil exploration and production company, Seplat Petroleum and Waltersmith Petroman Oil Limited, have donated some medical supplies to Imo State Government to support its efforts in equipping medical staff with necessary protective gears needed to contain the Coronavirus pandemic. The items donated included high quality protective gears, motorized and knapsack sprayers, hand sanitizers, facemasks, and hand gloves. Presenting the donations at the Government House, Owerri, Mr. Emeka Onyeagba of Seplat and Mr. Percy Oparaji of Waltersmith stated that it was part of their corporate social responsibilities to their host state. In appreciation, Imo State Governor, Senator Hope Uzodinma, thanked Seplat and Waltersmith for the gesture, noting that their kind donation would go a long way in assisting the state in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic. Addressing newsmen, the Chairman of the COVID-19 Prevention and Control Committee in Imo, Prof Maurice Iwu announced that equipment and isolation centres are in place with direct hotlines of relevant health institutions to screen suspects to determine if they need isolation. He, however, advised that “the best form of prevention is to stay at home and self-quarantine than to create unnecessary jeopardy amongst the people.”
