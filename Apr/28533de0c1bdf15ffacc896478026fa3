 THE Zone 2 Command of the Police Community Relations Committee (PCRC) has launched a feeding scheme for Police personnel within the Zone. Zone 2 PCRC Chairman Alhaji Bashiru R. Balogun said the gesture was in fulfilment of a pledge to support police officers during the near nationwide lockdown following the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The scheme, he said, provide food for police personnel in Lagos and Ogun States who “give their lives and time” enforcing the Federal Government’s stay at home COVID-19 directive. Balogun spoke Friday while launching the scheme at the Zone 2 Headquarters of the Nigeria Police Force, Onikan, Lagos. He said it was planned to run throughout the lockdown. “By this scheme, we want to remind the police personnel in the Zone of our commitments to stand by them in the fight against COVID-19”, Balogun added. Flagging-off the scheme,  Assistant Inspector-General in-charge of the Zone, Mr. Ahmed Iliyasu, said the donation would boost his personnel’s morale “at this critical period.”
