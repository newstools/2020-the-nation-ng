He appealed to Commissioner of Police, Bolaji Fafowora to investigate the six persons who were arrested by youths after an attempt to abduct a couple in their farm failed. Giving graphic details of the killings, the Commissioner said, “Three persons were killed in my community, specifically in Umuchaku Uhuala, another one at Umuodoma Alaocha. Two of the people killed were dumped in a hole where their decomposing bodies were found.” He said further that the third person was killed at Mbaraocha Umuike when she went to the farm. “These killings were carried out a month ago. Again, these killers who came from outside the council area, stormed my community again on Thursday. “Six of them came in a bus and when they arrived the same area, they attempted to abduct a man called Rufus in his farm. While they were struggling with him to push him into the waiting bus, the wife raised an alarm which attracted our community members.”
