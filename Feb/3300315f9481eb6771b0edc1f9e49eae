Nigeria’s Olajide Omotayo stormed back from the brink of defeat to record a come-back win over homeboy Guillermo Martinez at the ITTF Challenge Spanish Open on Thursday. The Lagos State-born star who has been inconsistent since winning the 2019 African Games, showed quality to advance to the second round at the tournament. Omotayo was a match from exiting the tournament but he regained his form to silence the home fans.
Despite taking the first set easily at 11-6, Omotayo was dazed when he conceded the next three games to the Spaniard at 9-11, 9-11, 7-11. Trailing 3-1, the Nigerian seeded number eight in the men’s singles knew that his stay at the competition was about to come to an end if he didn’t improve his performance. Omotayo changed tactics and won the last three games 11-2, 11-9, 11-4 to win 4-3 in memorable comeback. But what would have been a battle between two African brothers was halted yesterday as Egypt’s Khalid Assar was beaten by United States’ Mishel Levinski 4-2 and this means Omotayo will now face the American in the second round of the tournament.
