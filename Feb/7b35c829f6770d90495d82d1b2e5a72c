Thanks so much for sharing how much our film moved you! Are you a hard man or woman? Oya go and watch #TheLegendofInikpi and let us know.  “So grateful! #TheLegendofInikpi holds the biggest opening weekend in 2020 so far! “The first reaction to my film was a rude awakening; ‘epic movies don’t sell in Nigerian cinemas’ Honestly, I was terrified when I saw statistics on statistics… I’m humbled to see the love that #TheLegendofInikpi has received in its first week. It’s not the regular blockbuster figures of course but most importantly, it’s a strong validation that we should tell our stories and the people will come and watch them.”
