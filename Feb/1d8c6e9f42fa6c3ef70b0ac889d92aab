Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) Comptroller-General Hameed Ali (rtd) has urged officers and men of the Service to comply with  the rules guiding the NCS. Ali, who spoke to officers and men of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA) Command, Ikeja, Lagos, after inaugurating the Customs Processing Centre (CPC), advised the workers to step up the volume of seizures. “In the last three to four years that I have been with you, we have tried to reorientate everybody and accommodated ourselves by constant engagement. But now, I want to tell you that the era of Mr. Nice is over. Henceforth, I want to be getting the names of officers who are revenue risks. Officers interested in building a career and earning a living to take care of their family can be assured that the Service is the best place for them to be, but those interested in earning an income outside their salary should leave the Service. If I catch anyone involved in corruption, then you are finished; otherwise you have nothing to fear,” Ali warned.
