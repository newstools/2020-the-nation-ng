Fans of La Liga are in for an exciting time today as Real Mardid takes on Atletico in a derby in which Ghanaian import, Thomas Partey has been tipped to shine. The game, which will be on DStv and GOtv is expected to bring the best out the rivals. The Madrid derby is the pick of La Liga matches this coming weekend and a key clash for Atletico, who have struggled to find consistency in their form of late. Diego Simeone’s side are winless in their last four matches across all competitions, including a shock defeat to Cultural Leonesa in the Copa del Rey last midweek. One man who could inspire Atletico to raise their game is all-action midfielder and Ghana international Thomas Partey. While the club itself is struggling to live up to its high standards, Partey has been one of the Rojiblancos’ most consistent and impressive performers. In what has arguably been the Black Stars’ best season at the Spanish heavyweights, the 26-year-old has also taken up something of a leadership role for Atletico and is calling on the team to put their recent disappointments behind them and push hard for the remainder of the season. “We have not had confidence and that is what we lack. We have to be ourselves,” said the Ghanaian international. “You have to forget, there is no other option. Work hard and hopefully good things come out. What we need most is the support of the fans.” The game comes up at the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu.
