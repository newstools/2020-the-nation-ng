By Olaitan Ganiu To beef up his team of talented artistes, Basic Entertainment has signed an investment deal with TGP Entertainment signee, Gabriel Oche Amanyim, who is popularly known as Terry G. The three year partnership agreement was sealed on Monday in Lagos. According to the CEO of Basic Entertainment, Ogbuefi Udochukwu aka De Fire, the move is aimed to re-launch the dwindling career of the once hit-maker. “His kind of music is what’s trending in the music industry today,” said De Fire. “This deal will benefit both brands as Terry G has already established himself as a brand but the Basic Entertainment will rebrand him and bring him back to the limelight.”  On his part, Terry G said that for anyone to survive in the industry, they need a strong team. “This investment deal will surely benefit both parties,” said the ‘Free Madness’ crooner. “If you want to move forward, you need a team. You will never achieve anything without teamwork but when you have somebody that is supporting you genuinely you will surely achieve your goals.” Manager, Basic Entertainment, Alex Ozone, stated that the aim of the business is to develop a business relationship with top musicians as the record label is poised to invest in the Nigerian entertainment industry. “I initiated this partnership because my CEO is so much interested in the Nigerian entertainment industry. He recently launched a record label, signed two talented artistes, Elgo Veen and Skul Feez and will soon open his club.” The song of one of the artistes, Elgo Veen, titled ‘Singer’ and featuring HKN Gang act, B-Red, is currently gaining airplay. The song is produced by Endeetone and mixed and master by Mixmonsta.
