Osun State Governor Adegboyega Oyetola on Thursday declared open a two-day roundtable summit to review some of the extant policies on education, to strengthen the sector. The governor, represented by Deputy Governor Benedict Alabi, said the roundtable is in furtherance of the Oyetola administration’s promise to run an all-inclusive government based on the people’s yearnings and needs. The governor said:  “I believe good governance is about listening to the people who elected you and running a participatory system. That was what informed the Thank-you tour I embarked on after the election in 2018; to feel the pulse of the citizens and assess their needs. “We found out that there were aspects of the state education policy that they want removed, adjusted or improved upon. The DFID Citizens Needs Assessment also revealed that there are areas in our education policies that need to be strengthened.” “This is why we have lined up tested and proven hands in education in Nigeria here today to take a critical look at what we have and advise us on how to meet the needs of the people of Osun.” The 11-man committee is chaired by Prof. Olu Aina, former Registrar/Chief Executive, National Business and Technical Examinations Board (NABTEB).
