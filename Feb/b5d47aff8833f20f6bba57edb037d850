 BARELY a week after he assumed office, Governor Douye Diri of Bayelsa State is under pressure to jettison a key policy of his immediate predecessor and godfather, ex-Governor Henry Seriake Dickson. The policy borders on the engagement of non-indigenes in Bayelsa State Executive Council. SENTRY gathered that Bayelsa elders and opinion moulders have asked Diri to discard the policy in order to earn their confidence. Convesely,, they have threatened to withdraw their support for the governor if non-indigenes are accommodated. But liberal-minded Bayelsans who approved of Dicksonâ€™s policy have been trying to mediate because most of the affected non-indigenes are Ijaw from Delta, Rivers, Ondo and other states. They also claimed that since the non-indigenes were usually about 1% to 2% of political appointees, there is no basis for the furore. A few others said Bayelsa State does not have the manpower being offered by the non-indigenes. Some however said Dickson was only trying to live up to his dream of being a nationalist which is no longer applicable at the centre. The way and manner this issue is handled by Diri will define his future relationship with Dickson who staked everything to make him a governor.
