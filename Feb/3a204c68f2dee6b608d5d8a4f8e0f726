Activists under the aegis of the 2014 Nigeria Movement have called for the adoption of the 2014 National Conference report to address the challenges facing the country. It said restructuring holds the ace in proffering solutions to the nation’s challenges. The group visited Vintage Press Limited, publishers of The Nation titles to solicit support for the adoption of the 2014 National Conference report. Its National Chairman, Maj.-Gen. Henry Ayoola (retd.), said the report of the conference was exhaustive, adding that its adoption would usher in a better Nigeria. “The moderate are determined that that the country must restructure, inevitably and very urgently, for it to stand the slimmest chance of surviving this interesting time. All of these constitute an existential threat to our union and country as we know it. “It is significantly noteworthy that in the six decades of Nigeria’s self-rule, almost every area of Nigerian life has been performing below expectation. “Consequently, Nigerians have been wondering if anything good can ever come out of their country as things continue to degenerate to an all-round and all-time low due largely to ineffective leadership,” he said. The movement, he said, would work harder to ensure that the country attains a better nation. “Where there is a will, there is a way. We must prevent this evidently threatening national collapse and state failure in our interest. “It is on this note that we are proposing an array of actions across full spectrum with focal thrust and programmes to intervene and forestall an avoidable disaster. We are, therefore, determined to build a virile and vibrant nation within the next 100 years,” Ayoola said.
