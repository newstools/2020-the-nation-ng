A corps member, Aisha Isah Mahmud, deployed in Katsina State with registration number KT/19A/1630, on Saturday produced and donated customised school bags and other writing materials to 100 less-privileged school children in the state. Aisha, who was posted to serve in Kano Electricity Distribution Company (KEDCO) in Funtua local government area of the state, told The Nation on the sidelines of the presentation ceremony that she learnt the job while at the NYSC orientation camp, where she was introduced to the NYSC Skills Acquisition and Entrepreneurship Development, SAED, programme. Aside the leather work training learnt at the camp, she said she also learnt tailoring at the post camp training. She said her decision to donate to the school pupils was to impact on the children, particularly the less-privileged, and make her own little contribution to the educational standard and development of Katsina State. She said, “I sincerely thank the management of NYSC for subjecting us to learn a skill, which I wholeheartedly embraced in camp. Today, I am glad that I am graduating from its post-camp training.” Speaking at the event, the Katsina State NYSC Coordinator, Alhaji Ahidjo Yahaya, urged other corps members to take a cue from Aisha and embrace the NYSC Skills Acquisition and Entrepreneurship Development (SAED) programme. The coordinator was represented by the Zonal Inspector, Funtua Zone, Mallam Musa Ibrahim Abdu, and commended the corps member for the gesture Also speaking on behalf of the beneficiaries, the District Head of Funtua, Alhaji Sambo Idris Sambo, as well as the principals of the recipient schools, prayed and thanked the corps member and the NYSC for the gesture. The beneficiaries were drawn from Government College Funtua and Government Girls’ Secondary School also in Funtua local government area.
