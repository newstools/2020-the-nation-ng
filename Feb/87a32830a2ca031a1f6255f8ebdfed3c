Dare, while receiving AIG Alkali Mohammed, the Chairman, Police Games Planning Committee and Force Secretary who visited him in Abuja, noted that the Police Games had produced great talents for Nigeria. “The Games have produced talents such as Sunny Isekwena, Julius Aghahowa, Chioma Ajunwa, Samuel Peters, late Sunday Bada among others. “We are now hopeful that this event will throw up new talents that can represent the country at the Olympics and make us proud.’’ The minister expressed happiness that the Games was holding before the National Sports Festival (NSF) in Benin and would afford the ministry the opportunity of getting more athletes and facilities developed. “Scouts will be sent to Awka to fish out talents. The games will also be an opportunity to develop sports facilities,’’ he said. Mohammed said a record number of 3,000 police men and women would take part in the Games slated for Awka in Anambra. The Games Planning Committee Chairman said all was set for a hitch-free competition. “Athletes and teams from 12 zones of the Nigerian Police will be competing in the 10-day competition. “It will have events like track and field, football, squash, table tennis, boxing, wrestling, shooting, lawn tennis, basketball, among others. That is why we are here to assure the Minister that everything is set for the Nigerian Police Games in Anambra,’’ he said.
