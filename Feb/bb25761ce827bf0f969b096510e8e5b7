The Olowu of Kuta in Ayedire Local Government Area of Osun State, Oba Adekunle Oyelude Makama, Tegbosin II, has said that the sack of the service chiefs is not a solution to ending insurgency in the country. The monarch, who counseled the National Assembly and Nigerians calling for the sack of the service chiefs to have a rethink, maintained that the nation’s security situation call for holistic appraisal instead of “quick fix which we have embarked on to tackle the insurgency.” In a statement by him, Oba Makama said the call seemed to be hasty, adding “it is only a transfer of aggression to the service chiefs, who have sacrificed a lot to defend the territorial integrity and the internal security of the country.” Acknowledging that the security architecture of the country needs to be overhauled for optimum performance, he said people should know that the military alone is not to be blamed for the lapses in the security operation. The traditional ruler said the call seemed to be hasty and a transfer aggression to the service chiefs despite their sacrifice to defend the territorial integrity and the internal security of the country. Oba Makama maintained that though the security of the country needs to be overhauled for optimum performance, he said people should know that the military alone is not to be blamed for the lapses, therefore, calling for what he called political option. The monarch  further said that when dealing with the issue of security, there is need to be circumspect not to jeopardize the success so far achieved, reminding that insurgent war is different from conventional warfare, which, according to him, is more predictable during operation. Olowu said it is apparent that the military is overstretch, hence his call for concerted efforts involving other security agencies to confront the insurgency and record unprecedented breakthrough needed to end the tension in the affected area.
