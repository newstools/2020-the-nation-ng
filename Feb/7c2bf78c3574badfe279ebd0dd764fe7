 A PROSECUTION witness and community head of Makoko Waterfront, Lagos, Mr Steven Aji, on Tuesday narrated to an Igbosere High Court, Lagos, how a police officer shot and killed one of his chiefs. Aji said this while giving evidence in the ongoing trial of a dismissed police officer, Cpl. Pepple Boma, charged with manslaughter. The community head, who was led in evidence by the Lagos State Prosecuting Counsel, Mr Hafeez Owokoniran, told the court that the defendant shot and killed one Timothy Hunpoyanwa during the destruction of Makoko waterfront settlement. He said that the state government had given the residents notice to evacuate the settlement 24 hours before the incident occurred. Aji said that he and his chiefs were already making arrangements to meet the government agents to ask for more time to enable them get another area to settle. He narrated to Justice Module Nicole-Clay that immediately after the notice to vacate the area was given to them, government officials and police started destroying their houses. “Some little children fell into the lagoon as we were trying to rescue them; we were beaten with horsewhip. “While I was trying to pacify the officials to give us more time to enable us leave the waterfront, I saw the defendant shooting the deceased, Timothy Hunpoyanwa in the stomach,” Aji narrated. The case was adjourned till February 26.
