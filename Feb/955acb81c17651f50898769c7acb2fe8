Lagos State Government on Thursday promised to ease the way of doing business through exploration of opportunities that would enhance synergy between it and the business community. Commissioner for Commerce, Industry and Cooperatives Dr. Lola Akande gave the assurance at a meeting with the Lagos business community in Alausa, Ikeja. The meeting had the theme: “Lagos Business Community: Toward Making Lagos State a 21st Century Economy”. Akande said that the meeting was an opportunity to enter into a dialogue with the business community and generate useful ideas. “Let us know what they feel about new policies and if they have suggestions. “We want to know how convenient it is for them. “I believe the way of doing business in the state is much better than it used to be because of so many things the government has put in place,” the commissioner said. She said that Lagos State remained an investment hub owing to its growing population and efforts to ensure security of lives and property. “We have a lot of constructions going on; once there is a network of good roads, prices of goods will reduce and foreign investors will want to come in. “Lagos State has the market for any business, we have the population as people troop into the state every second. This means we have markets. “Lagos is an investment hub; securitywise, we are okay, considering the security outfit in place. I assure you we are relatively secure,” Akande said. The President of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), Mrs. Toki Mabogunje, called for an understanding on common issues between the business community and state government.
