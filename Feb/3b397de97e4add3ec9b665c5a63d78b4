By Osagie Otabor, Bénin There was tension along Murtala Mohammed Way in Bénin City as some youths and family members of one late Etinosa Obakpolor barricaded the busy highway in protest over uncaring attitude of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC). Late Etinosa was reportedly shot dead by some officials of the NSCDC in last August. The protesting youths said the exercise because the NSCDC abandoned the family and refused to pay after the boy was buried. Spokesman for the protesters, Mr. Joseph Isikuemen, said Etinosa was shot dead by NSCDC officials. “They were returning from somewhere when they were pursued. They were shot at. Etinosa died while others sustained injuries. “The family went to the NSCDC. They assured that they will pay compensation and we agreed to bury the corpse. “We have been going there because there is a girl that was pregnant for him and agreed to keep the baby. We want justice. “It was during the protest the NSCDC officials said they have N800,000 but we will refused to go and collect the money. We want the state government to be involved. Edo spokesman of NSCDC, Mr. Efosa Ogbebor, could not be reached for comments but some officials who pleaded anonymity said the father of the deceased has been settled. The source said: “That matter has been resolved since last year. If the father was not in that protest. We resolved it with the family. “We have settled the matter. We are dealing with the father, the youths were looking for where to rob. They were burgling stores. They took advantage of the situation to carry out attacks on shops.”
