Workers of the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC) on Tuesday disrupted activities at the Commission when they clashed with the Commissioners. It was gathered that trouble had been brewing in the Commission for some time but it came to a head yesterday afternoon when the workers said they couldn’t take it anymore. It was gathered that around noon, the decision was taken by the angry workers to lock the Commission down. The reason for the lock down was the alleged encroachment into the official duties of the workers who are career civil servants. An official of the Commission who pleaded anonymity said:  “Board members as Commissioners were encroaching on staff official schedule.” When the protest started, the angry workers locked the main gate used by the commissioners. Caught in the protest was the Chairman of the Commission Engr Elias Mbam who was prevented from leaving the building.\ Other commissioners present when the protest started were also prevented from leaving the building while those outside were barred from coming into the Commission. The security men on duty prevented some reporters from covering the protest and went ahead to seize their phones and deleted the protest photos. They claimed that they did not want the matter going public. A worker who spoke with reporters confidence said: “Since the board was inaugurated, they have been encroaching into our responsibility. They are policy makers and not policy implementers but they have taken over the day to day running of the Commission from us the official staff.”
