Nigeria forward Saviour Godwin has set his sights on helping KSV Roeselare gain promotion to the top division after marking his 100th appearance for the Belgian side recently. Godwin made his milestone appearance for Roeselare when they hosted Leuven in a league clash in December and he has gone to play six times for Northern Belgium-side since then. Godwin has scored 18 goals in his 106 appearances for Roeselare to date, making him the most capped African player at the club. The 23-year-old who has scored four times this term is under contract with Roeselare until next summer. The former Flying Eagles striker is also not worried about missing out on playing for the Super Eagles, especially when some of his former team mates in the youth ranks are now established players in the national team. “Everyone has their own time and I strongly believe my time will come soon,” the former Golden Eagles said in a chat with NationSport. “Right now I am focused on helping my club gain promotion to the elite division. “We narrowly missed promotion last season. We qualified to play in the promotion final against Royal Antwerp but we lost the final game and missed promotion. “Qualifying for the final and losing it were my best and worst moments since I joined Roeselare from Oostende.” Roeselare are currently seventh in the Belgian second division with 12 points from eleven games.
