Barcelona have been given permission by La Liga to sign a replacement for injured Ousmane Dembele. Dembele, who suffered a complete hamstring tear in his right thigh, was ruled out for six months. According to La Liga rules, having a player ruled out for at least five months with injury gave a club the right to ask for permission to sign a striker out of the transfer window, but only to play for the club in La Liga. Barcelona now have fifteen days to sign a player from a La Liga club or a free agent. Getafe’s Angel and Alaves’ Lucas Perez were close but Leganes’ Martin Braithwaite seems the most likely option Barcelona will choose.
