 Ping-ponger  Olajide Omotayo aims to restore his pride as he begins campaign  today  as one of the seeded players at the ITTF Challenge Spanish Open in Grenada. Being his second major international tournament aside the World Team Olympic Tournament held in Portugal, Omotayo is seeded eight among the 32 players listed for the  qualifier with a possible second round showdown against Egypt’s Khalid Assar. The 24-year-old failed to make it beyond the preliminary stage of the German Open and in Spain, he is considered one of the top stars in pole position to make it to the podium but the former Nigerian national junior champion will have to race his game against the rest of the world. “I want to compete in more tournaments this year so that I can get used to playing against some of the best in the world,” he said. “There is no doubt that playing in Africa is different from playing in other ITTF tournaments. ”I know it is not going to be easy but I am ready to endure and continue to work harder in order to achieve my dream of doing well this year. This tournament is part of my preparations for the Olympic Qualifiers in Tunis later this month,” he added. Meanwhile, ITTF has confirmed Omotayo along with Aruna Quadri, Segun Toriola and Bode Abiodun in Nigeria’s men’s team for the 2020 World Team Championships in Busan, South Korea in March.
