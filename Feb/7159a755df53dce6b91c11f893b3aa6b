Adesoji Adeniyi, Osogbo The Redeemer’s University Ede in Osun State has conducted matriculation for 788 students for the 2019/2020 academic session. Speaking at the event, the Vice-Chancellor Prof. Anthony Akinlo, who said the exercise was the fifteenth matriculation of the institution, explained that the number comprised of 748 UTME, direct entry and transfer students while the remaining 40 were postgraduate students. According to him, the fresh students were being conferred full membership of the university because they had fulfilled all necessary admission requirements. The vice chancellor enjoined the students to be of good behavior and be law abiding within the university and good ambassadors outside the institution. He urged them to acquaint themselves with the Students’ Handbook of Information and avoid involvement in acts of misconduct like stealing, drug abuse, cultism, fighting, examination malpractice and vices. Akinlo said: “In line with the tradition accorded the last eight sets admitted into the university where they had unique and prophetic names which set them apart, this set has been prayerfully given a name and they are christened Dominion Set.” He further stated that this name is in line with the vision of the visitor to the university, Pastor E. A. Adeboye, who according to him envisions products of the university as employers of labour and key distinguished employees in their various endeavour wherein they chose to work. Advising the parents, he said: “We urge our parents to join hands with us in ensuring that these young ones have an all-round training so that they will be found worthy both in character and learning in order for them to excel in all ramifications.”
