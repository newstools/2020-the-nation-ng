By Frank Ikpefan, Abuja Some young professionals in the country have called on governors of the Niger Delta to encourage those doing meaningful businesses in the region. The Chairman of Nigerian Young Professionals Forum (NYPF), Moses Siasia, in a statement on Sunday in Abuja, said this was the only hope for the region right now, lamenting that the society had neglected productivity for too long. He noted that some leaders in the region have not done the needful towards galvanising the energy and idealism of the teeming young population towards more productive ventures. Siasia said people of questionable character are now role models, saying that no sane society anywhere in the world neglects hard work and innovation. He said the group was ready to champion a new narrative towards stimulating the growth of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) in the Niger Delta. He said a two million naira grant will be given to the best and most innovative business at the proposed MSME summit and exhibition in the Niger Delta region in March 2020. Siasia said a team of young people with futuristic thinking has been put together for the summit/exhibition which has “Stimulating MSME Growth Beyond Oil” as its theme. He said the summit will host over 4,000 small business owners across all the states in the region. Siasia also said the summit will be attended by young business owners between the ages of 18 and 45, saying it will be a two-day summit featuring product exhibitions, main-stage keynotes, interactive master sessions, style breakouts, business to business meetings, mentoring sessions, and networking opportunities among others. He further explained that the event will host exhibition stands for business owners to showcase and sell their various products.
