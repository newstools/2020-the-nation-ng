 Former Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu is the leader of the Southeast Caucus in the Senate, it was learnt on Wednesday. Minority Leader Enyinnaya Abaribe announced this during plenary. Abaribe made the announcement through a Point of Order. The senator said Ekweremadu was unanimously elected in an election he described as very peaceful. Ekweremadu, who represents Enugu West, was elected on Tuesday night in Abuja at a bipartisan meeting of Southeast senators at Abaribe’s home. He was unopposed. Ekweremadu was Deputy Senate President between 2007 and 2009. But he lost the position to Senator Ovie Omo-Agege during the election of principal officers for the Ninth National Assembly’s election in 2019. Before Ekweremadu was elected the Southeast Caucus Leader, some other politicians from the region had opted for a former Enugu State Governor Chimaroke Nnamani. The ex-governor, it was learnt, stepped down at the last minute to give Ekweremadu a smooth sail. The ex-Deputy Senate President is the longest-serving senator from the Southeast and one of the longest-serving in the country. Abaribe said: “I got a message this morning from the Southeast Caucus that the Chairman of the Southeast Caucus is Distinguished Senator Ike Ekweremadu. I have handed over to him and the election was peaceful.” Senate President Ahmad Lawan thanked Abaribe “for steering the ship of the Southeast Caucus over the years”. He added: “You did very well. We are expecting that you will do better as Minority Leader.” Lawan also congratulated Ekweremadu, saying: “You did very well as Deputy President of the Senate. We expect that the Southeast Caucus will cooperate with you to ensure that, that part of the country feels satisfactorily represented.”
