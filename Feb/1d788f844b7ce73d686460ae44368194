 A 35-year old man identified as Monday Clement Shola has been arrested by men of the Edo State Police Command for allegedly impersonating Edo State Commissioner of Police, Jimeta Lawan, to dupe rich individuals in the state. Shola claimed he was a former Senior Special Assistant to the Edo State Government during the administration of former Governor Adams Oshiomhole. He said he used one of his lines to call ‘a person’ and introduced himself as Edo Commissioner of Police. Shola said he asked the ‘person’ to give attention to one Clement (himself) adding that the intention was for the ‘person’ to call him. His words, “Eventually the person called and invited me to his office. I explained to the person how I was arrested and stuff like that. I met with the person one on one. He asked me to drop my account number and I will hear from him. “Four days later. the account was credited with N2.5m. 40 minutes later I saw another alert of N10m making it N12.5m. I didn’t know the money was meant for two seperate account but mistakenly paid all into my account. He called me to asked if I had seen the money. He also called the other line I used to first call him. “Two days later I went to the bank and was told the account was blocked. They told me money was mistakenly credited to the account. I had to return the N10m.” When pressed on who sent him the money, he said it was Adams Oshiomhole. He claimed he bought a Toyota Camry with the N2.5m.
