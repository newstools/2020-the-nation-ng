Two men, Jerry Fidelis and Timothy Jacob, were on Monday brought before an Ajegunle Chief Magistrates’ Court in Lagos State for allegedly stealing machine spare parts worth N800,000 from a company. Fidelis, 36, and Timothy, 38, both resident at Amuwo Odofin, Lagos State, pleaded not guilty to the two-count charge of conspiracy and stealing. The Magistrate, Mrs Joy Ugbomoiko, granted the defendants bail in the sum of N50,000 each with two sureties each in like sum. Ugbomoiko said that the sureties must be gainfully employed and have verifiable residential and office addresses. She adjourned the case until February 27. Prosecutor Ben Aigbokhan earlier told the court that the defendants committed the offences on January 15 at Maja Village, Tomato Onisuwo Island, Apapa, Lagos. Aigbokhan said that the complainant and Site Manager of Albus Construction Company, Mr Aina Olanrewaju reported the alleged crime at the Ilado Police Station, Onisuwo Island, Lagos. “The defendants conspired and stole an excavator track, control panel, compactor, excavator and some batteries,” he told the court. “They sold the parts for N25,000 and shared the money. All efforts made to retrieve the stolen spare parts proved abortive as they could not remember the buyer.” According to the prosecutor, the offences violate Sections 287 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that Section 287 carries three years’ imprisonment for stealing, while Section 411 attracts two years’ jail term for conspiracy.
