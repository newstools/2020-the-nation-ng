WNBA and Nigerian-American basketball star, Chinenye ‘Chiney’ Ogwumike has said that passion and purpose are the two elements needed to become a success in life. The basketball star who stated this while speaking to students of Avi-Ceena International School on Monday noted that both elements if effectively combined will make them unstoppable in their quest to reach the top. She told the student that combining their education and sports and other hobbies was possible if they have the ‘I-can-do-it’ spirit, adding that they can achieve whatever they want if they can dream it. The Los Angeles Sparks player warned succeeding in basketball or any other sports was more than just having the set skills: “I must tell you that one has to have a purpose and be passionate about what he or she is doing. With these two elements, one can achieve whatever he set out to do. It will be challenging but it is realizable.” Ogwumike said that she was awful on her first day on the basketball court and she stayed out of the game for one year relying on the tutelage of her elder sister Nneka to become a basketball star. Ogwumike who holds the record for the most rebounds in the history of Stanford Women’s Basketball and the Pac-12 Conference, will also meet with young female professional basketball players at the Molade Okoya Thomas Indoor Sports Hall inside the Teslim Balogun Stadium Complex.
