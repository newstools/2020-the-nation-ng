 CHAIRMAN of the Kwara State Weightlifting   Association, Dr. Steve Olarinoye has lauded the state Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrasaq following the successful hosting of the state’s sports festival for the first time in almost two decades. Olarinoye, a one-time member of the Commonwealth Weightlifting Federation (CWF), described it as ‘the rejuvenated’ Kwara Sports Festival, adding that nothing much would have been achieved without the support of the sport-loving Governor of the state. “No doubt, sports in Kwara have been in a bad state for some time,” stated Olarinoye, a board member of Nigeria weightlifting Federation (NWF) who was a Director (Sports) until his retirement from the Federal Civil Service. “But with the coming of the Sports loving Governor Abdulrasaq, we have hope for a great turn around. “You can imagine the staging of the just concluded 7th Kwara State Sports Festival that was last held about 16 years ago, the amiable Governor thought it necessary to revive it. That’s a Governor that has the youths in mind. “Because of the zeal of the Governor we had no option than to give our best towards the success of the Festival and this took us to all the 16 LGA in the state with the novel introduction of the Torch of Unity by the MOC which was not part of the original plans for the Festival.” Olarinoye said being part of the MOC has opened his eyes to the sporting needs of the state, adding the state stands to benefit from his repertoire after holding forth in varied sporting positions before his retirement including being the Executive Secretary of Nigeria Professional League.
