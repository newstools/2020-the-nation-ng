  A 50-YEAR-OLD woman, Mrs Rose Friday, on Tuesday appeared before Justice F. Riman of the Federal High Court sitting in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, charged with habouring pregnant girls. She was suspected to be a human trafficker. Friday was arraigned on a two-count charge of habouring and exploiting young expectant mothers by selling their babies. The offences are contrary to the provision of Section 13(2)(b) of the Trafficking in Persons (Prohibition) Enforcement and Administration Act, 2015. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the suspect was arraigned in charge No: FHC/Uyo/99c/2019 by the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP). The suspect, who pleaded not guilty to the charges, was remanded at a correctional centre, and the case adjourned until February 12. NAN gathered that before she was arrested, the suspect was under the surveillance of the Nigerian Naval Ship (NSS) Jubilee, Ikot Abasi for suspected human trafficking. In his reaction, Mr Nduka Nwanwenne, Commander, NAPTIP, Uyo Zonal Command, said that there would be no hiding place for human traffickers in the zone.
