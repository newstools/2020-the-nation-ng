The Baale of Osun Egbado, Chief Ayuba Olabintan, on behalf of the community, hailed the chairman’s populist style of governance, which he said, had eased their challenges. He listed some of the chairman’s other gestures to include the building of the police divisional headquarters at Ilogbo, construction of health care centres, provision of two patrol buses for Morogbo Police Station, periodic grading of roads, provision of writing materials for pupils in public schools and poverty alleviation packages for the aged and widows. Olabintan said: “It is in the light of this that we have endorsed the Chairman, Olatunde aka Mr. Project, for a second term. “We’re thanking you and asking for more. Our community needs schools, health care centres, grading of the road that leads to the community for easy access, reconstruction of our market and creation of polling units.”
