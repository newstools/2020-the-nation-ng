Nasarawa State has been selected as one of the agro industrial zones by the African Development Bank (AfDB). Governor Abdullahi Sule stated this at the weekend during the 2019 Banker’ Committee dinner and award night in Lafia. Sule said officials of the bank have confirmed that Nasarawa is among the six states selected to benefit from the project. He appealed to the banks to partner the government to make this a reality since with the agro processing zone will attract Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), and subsequently major players will be part of the agro-industrial zone. The AfDB recently said it has earmarked $500 million loan for the development of agro-industrial zones across various states.  Called the Special Agro Industrial Process, the bank said it will be similar to the free trade zone, where thousands of direct and indirect jobs will be created for Nigerians. This is coming on the heels of recent achievement recorded by the administration in agriculture, particularly with the Dangote Group already working in Tunga, Doma and Nasarawa Local Government Areas; with Azman Farm and Rice Mill having completed arrangements to cultivate 14,000 hectares of land for rice production in Toto Local Government Area. “Few days ago, we also received the Flour Mills of Nigeria, which will also establish its own 20,000 hectares of land around Umuasha for cassava and sugar plantations,” the governor added. He, however, said these successes will not be possible without the support of the bankers.
