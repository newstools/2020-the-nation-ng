The 2020 GTBank  Lagos International Polo Tournament galloped off on an exciting  note yesterday  with Lagos Wontra bagging a 6-5 win over Lagos Almina Group while Golden Alchemy outplayed Lagos Dania A+ 10-4 in Silver Cup encounters. Wontra, formed by Charles Oluwole, Altaf Abubakar, Yemo Alakija and Aliyu Tijani, underlined their intentions from the start with Tijani scoring with an inside shot with barely 20 seconds inside the keenly-contested Stream A game. The second match of the day was contrasting to the preceding match as Alchemy outplayed Dania A+ to lay claims as one of the favourites for the Silver Cup Khalifa Adams was the stand out performer scoring a handful of Golden Alchemy’s goals while Sadiq and Bilal Dantata as well as Musadiq Tahir also played crucial roles in securing the vital victory in Stream B. Action-packed Matchday 2 will see five matches to be played in the Silver Cup while an enthralling Open Cup tie is anticipated between  Lagos A+ Bluechip and Lagos Shoreline to round off the today’s activities.
