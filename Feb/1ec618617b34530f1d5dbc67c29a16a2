 Labour in Kebbi State has directed workers to begin indefinite strike on March 3 following the government’s inability to pay the N30,000 minimum wage. Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) Umar Alhassan, who addressed reporters after the State Executive Council (SEC) meeting yesterday, said workers had been directed to prepare for strike on March 3. He said: “We are here to discuss the ultimatum given the government on our demands, which will expire by March 2, at 12am. That is why we summoned an extra large meeting to inform our members about the situation. “There has not been positive response from government in respect to our demands. We have directed members to mobilise ahead of Tuesday’s industrial action.” Chairman of Trade Union Congress (TUC) Hussaini Yelwa said all unions under the congress had been mobilised for the strike. He added that all members of the unions have been mobilised to take part in the strike.
