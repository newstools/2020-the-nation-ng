By Tony Akowe, Abuja  Members of the House of Representatives on Tuesday rejected a motion calling for the evacuation of Nigerians in Wuhan, China over fears of contacting the dreaded coronavirus. Wuhan is the city where the dreaded coronavirus emanated from with Nigerians resident there reportedly sending in a Save Our Souls message to return home. Hon. Ben Kalu had sought the permission of the House to move a motion of urgent public importance on the need to evacuate Nigerians from the city.
