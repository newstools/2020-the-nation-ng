The names of nominees for the event slated for May 2020 will be announced later. “Deedee Records decided to expand its scope by honouring those fighting for the needy with their resources and arts. We will be focusing on humanitarian works now that we have a foundation in place. So the DDEA Humanitarian Award USA is coming to Nigeria for the first time. Our goal is to thank those helping the needy and encourages others to do the same. We will be hosting the Face of DDEA competition on May 29 as part of the final event.”  Describing the scope of the award ceremony, Amed-O, the ‘No Woman, No Man’ crooner, who is in charge of the local organising committee lauded the management of the recording company for stepping out to spur people to support the needy in the society. “This event is coming to Africa for the first time,” he said. “It is special because we will also be crowning a queen in Nigeria, who will participate at the Face of DDEA contest in USA in September.
