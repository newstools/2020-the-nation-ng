Our Reporter  Afropop singer and songwriter, Yemi Alade has released a new jam titled Shekere, featuring four-time Grammy winner, Angelique Kidjo. The song, which has been well-received by fans of the singer, was shot in Narok County, Kenya. It pays tribute to African music and its accompaniments like the tambourine and the shekere. Speaking on the new collaboration, Yemi Alade, who shared the news on her Instagram handle, wrote: “Super excited about this record, we have been working back and forth for two years on this song, #SHEKERE. The video is out now. @angeliquekidjo thank you Mami.”  Expectedly, Angelique Kidjo brought her strong vocals to bear in the song as she drops some lines from her 1996 monster hit track, Wombo Lombo. Directed by Ovie Etseyatse, the video for the new song is choreographed by the Sarakasi Dancers.
