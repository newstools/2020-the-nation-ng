Nigeria’s Oyinlomo Quadre along with her Cameroonian partner Cameroun’s Anna Lorie Lemongo Toumbou has won the doubles event at the ITF/CAT African Closed Junior Championships 18 & Under that ended yesterday in Pretoria, South Africa. Quadre put behind her setback in the singles even  where despite being the number three seed became the first casualty as she was bundled out by South Africa’s Delien Kleinhans in the first round. That defeat must have fired up the Nigerian in the doubles where she partnered Toumbou and their journey to the podium was a smooth ride. From the first round, they lived up to their status as the number two seed as they edged out the duo of Zimbabwe’s Chelsea Chakanyuka and Benin Republic’s Gloriana  Goreti Nahumhse 6-0, 6-1. They continued their good run with another win over Algeria’s Ines Bekrar and Tunisia’s Wiem Boubaker 6-2, 7-5 to berth in the semifinal. They were then pitched against the number three seed Egypt’s Maria Charl and Kenya’s Angella Okutoyi in what turned out to the their biggest task. Quadre and her partner won the first set at 6-4 but their opponents restored parity to win the second set at 6-1.However, the deciding set became the toughest of the sets and they fought well to win the tie at 10-5. The final witnessed the battle between two giants as the number one and two seeds pairs slug it out for the title. Number one seed, Morocco’s Sara Akid and Yasmine Kabbaj who also had a smooth sail to the final wanted the title but Quadre and her Cameroonian partner had the tactic to demystify their opponents.
