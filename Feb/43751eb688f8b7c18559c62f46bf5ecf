 THE Nigeria Taekwondo Federation (NTF) has named a four-man team for the World Taekwondo (WT) African Qualification Tournament for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games scheduled for February 21 to 23 in Rabat, Morocco. 2019 African Games gold medalist, 25-year-old Chinazum Nwosu will lead the team which include, African Games bronze medallists – 24-year-old Benjamin Okuomose and 20-year-old Elizabeth Anyanacho as well as Nigeria Open gold medalist 21-year-old Ifeoluwa Ajayi. The team has been training for several weeks in Abuja coupled with competing at the World Taekwondo (WT) sanctioned tournament in United Arab Emirates (UAE). Earlier reports have indicated that the team was yet to secure funds to make the important qualification event, which is the only chance left for Nigeria to secure Olympic tickets for the Taekwondo event of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. But  Olympian Chika Chukwumerije has  warned of dire consequences  should the  Nigeria miss out of the  qualifying tournament for Tokyo 2020. He however expressed his optimism that the National taekwondo team will arrive in Rabat Morocco on time to compete at the African Qualification tournament for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic to be held between 21 and 23 February 2020. Chukwumerije, who is currently the technical director, allayed the fears of the team missing out on the Olympic qualifications while noting how important it is for Nigeria to be at the qualification event. “This qualification tournament is very important and the sports ministry knows this and has affirmed their support.  They are on top of issues and I am hopeful that the team will depart and arrive in time for the Olympic qualification tournament. The leadership have been very gracious and supportive of our preparations so I am sure it will be sorted it ASAP.”
