 THE House of Representatives has directed its Committee on Population to investigate the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) over the various challenges being encountered in the registration of Nigerians for the National Identity Number (NIN). This was sequel to a motion of Urgent Public Importance presented by Rep. Ben Igbakpa during plenary yesterday. The motion was titled: “The Need for the PTDF to Suspend the National Identity Number as a Precondition for Scholarships, and Related Matters”. When the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila, who presided over plenary, called for a voice vote, the motion was passed by majority members. Igbakwa, while presenting the motion, said the Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF) announced that applicants for its 2020 scholarship for Masters and doctorate degrees, must have a NIN and verify before applying for the scholarship. According to him, the registration of the NIMC was “laborious and slow nationwide” and attributed it to inadequate facilities and manpower. He said: “The Director-General of NIMC, Mr Aliyu Azeez, recently admitted in a national daily that they are overwhelmed with work because, whereas they need about 4,000 centres nationwide, they make do with only 1,000 centres at the moment.”
