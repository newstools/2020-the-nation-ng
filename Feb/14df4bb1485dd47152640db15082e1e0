The 32-year- old small forward moved on to London Lightning in Canada where he averaged 5.3 PPG, 3.0 RPG and 1.5 APG. Baptist, an undrafted pick in the 2011 NBA Draft has also played for Baxi Manresa and Unicaja Malaga in Spain, Merlins Crailsheim in Germany and Keflavik in Iceland.

The 26-year-old power forward was one of nine Egyptian-born players on an NCAA team, seven of whom played an NCAA Division 1 team. Mohamed also averaged 5.9 PPG and 3.8 RPG while shooting 47.7 percent as a junior at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) and helped the Rams as they are fondly called to a 26-9 record as he played in 33 of 34 games and nine starts in the 2016/2017 season.
