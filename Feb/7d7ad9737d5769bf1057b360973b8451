Nigeria’s Elizabeth Anyanacho has qualified for the taekwondo event of Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games after she defeated former African Champion, Gabon’s Urgence Mouega 12 – 5 at the African Qualifiers holding in Rabat, Morocco. Anyanacho will be going to Tokyo as the first Taekwondo female to qualify for the Olympics since Athens 2004 Olympics and second ever Nigeria Taekwondo female practitioner, after Princess Dudu, to qualify for the Olympics. Benjamin Okuomose arrowly lost 16 – 19 to Olympic Silver Medalist & former World Champion, Gabon’s Anthony Obame. For the technical director of Nigeria Taekwondo Federation, Chika Chukwumerije the loss of Okuomose was unfortunate. “My heart was broken. He was leading all the way until 12 secs to end of match. The lad did well. “Sometimes, one cannot explain the anxiety and pressure an athlete feels. I feel sorry for his shattered Olympics dreams, but it is ok. He now has to fight for the bronze medal,” he lamented. According to the rules, the winner of the bronze medal match will be on standby in case there is a doping violation by any of the finalists. Chinazum Nwosu and Ifeoluwa Ajayi will compete today February 23.
