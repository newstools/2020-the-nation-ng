No de-radicalised Boko Haram member has been enlisted into the military, the Coordinator, Operation Safe Corridor (OPSC), Maj.-Gen Bamidele Shafa, has said. Maj.-Gen. Shafa made the clarification on Thursday in Abuja during a chat with reporters after a visit to the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development. He said that the military is a professional body adhering strictly to rules and regulations governing its activities, including enlistment. Gen. Shafa said: “None of the 280 boys that graduated from the OPSC is recruited into the Nigerian military. “We have our criteria for recruitment. To be recruited, you must be a Nigerian, must not have been convicted of any offence, and must not have been a member of any proscribed organisation. “So, considering the criteria, none of these boys has been recruited into the military. “OPSC just finished its follow-up into the communities and these boys are doing very well. None of them is in the military. “So, I want to assure Nigerians that none of these boys has been recruited and I am not sure any one of them will be recruited in the future,” he stressed.
