 IT is no longer news that the President of the Senate, His Excellency, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, on Thursday raised a 56-man Constitution Review Committee. One characteristic of the composition of the committee is that about 53 senators were left out, leading to some grumblings by those not opportune. The real secret about the jostle for a seat in the committee was not about the assignment but the allowance attached to it. Sentry eavesdropped that each member of the committee is to earn about N1.2million per sitting. The mere hearing of the siatting allowance unsettled some senators, who are already cash-strapped. Members of the 9th National Assembly have been finding it tough to survive and meet the financial pressure from their constituents. Unknown to the aggrieved senators, only N1billion has been voted for Constitution Review, which is not even enough, going by the activities of the committee.
