 THE Lagos State Government will from 8pm today close down Jonathan Coker Street at Fagba area till 6am the next day to allow the installation of the rubber panels on the Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge rail project. Alternative routes have been provided for road users to utilise during the construction to ensure motorists reach their destinations with ease. Motorists plying Jonathan Coker axis will be diverted to the Ashade, Toyin and Adejobi level crossing to reduce the inconvenience of the ongoing construction and aid road users to get to their destinations. The closure has been slated at this time, to ensure there is smooth and uninterrupted flow of work on the rail tracks. Lagos State Government is hereby appealing to residents, especially motorists that ply the corridors to bear the pains, as the project is aimed at achieving a seamless multi modal transport system that will meet the transportation need of a larger population.
