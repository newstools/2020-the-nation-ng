By Akeem Lawal  Organisers of Nigeria’s most vibrant and biggest cricket league, Club Cricket Committee (CCC) League is providing new ways to help young cricket players get ready for the future aside playing the sport. The CCC organised a career talks at the Tafawa Balewa Square recently where close to 100 young players were mentored on career choice, self-improvement, skill acquisition and networking to help prepare them for the future. In a chat with NationSport, a cricketer and chairman Media Committee of the Club Cricket Committee, Seun Odeku, said the idea of the programme is to let the young ones know that beyond sports that they play, they need to ensure that they also take care of themselves on the career side. Afolabi, who spoke about personal branding, explained how the players could better market themselves, their products and businesses and how they can reach the right customers and clients in future. “Social media is important as regards their brand and the businesses they want to build in the future. This is because most of their customers are on social media and for a marketing person, there is no business without paying clients. It means that we have to go to where they are and so social media is where they are and that is why it is important.
