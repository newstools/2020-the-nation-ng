 THE Lagos State Safety Commission has advised motorists to be safety conscious “during this harmattan season.” Director-General Lanre Mojola said on Thursday in a statement in Lagos that motorists should be extra careful when driving, as visibility is poor early in the morning and late in the evening due to the dry and dusty Northeast winds synonymous with the haramattan season. He said that the current weather conditions might reduce the vision of a driver by 200 metres, thereby creating hazardous driving conditions. Mojola said: “In severe weather conditions, road signage and markings may be difficult to see, as drivers need to use fog lights or low beam lights and not the high beam, as it may cause glare hindering possibilities of seeing what is ahead.” He said that as a standard, motorists should head out early to their destinations to avoid speeding while on the highways, adding that they should maintain significant distance between other road users and vehicles ahead, to prevent sudden braking that might lead to accidents due to poor visibility. Mojola advised motorists on the need to use hazard lights in extreme cases of very low or poor visibility, adding that motorists should desist from usage of windscreens with cracks, as these may also reduce visibility when driving during harsh weather conditions. He stressed the need for fire extinguisher, extra tyre, torch light, jack, spanners, C caution sign and other basic tools, saying these should be in their vehicles in case of unforeseen circumstances.
