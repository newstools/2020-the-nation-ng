 THE police in Lagos on Thursday rescued a 28-year-old man Princewill David who jumped into the lagoon at Third Mainland Bridge in a suicide attempt. The incident occurred about last midnight, less than two weeks after another young man jumped into the lagoon for yet to be ascertained reasons. It was gathered that David, a resident of 42, Tajudeen Balogun Street, Igando, took the dive after his lover broke up with him. The foreign exchange dealer was said to have requested a hailing taxi service only to tell the driver to stop midway through the bridge for him to urinate. The Nation gathered that the driver turned down his request following the new trend of passengers asking drivers to stop for them to pee only to jump into the water. It was learnt that the driver accelerated until he sighted operatives of the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) before he slowed down. As soon as the driver slowed down, David was said to have jumped off the car and into the lagoon where he landed on logs of wood. It was gathered that the policemen quickly went after him, rescued and rushed him to hospital. David was said to have fractured his legs and sustained other body injuries as a result of the jump.
