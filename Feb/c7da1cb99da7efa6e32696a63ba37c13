 NIGERIA Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) has denied alleged tampering with the January salary of its personnel. In a statement on Sunday in Abuja by its spokesman Emmanuel Okeh, a copy of which was made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), NSCDC said some of its personnel accused it of pilfering with their salary following observed shortfalls in the January pay packet. But Okeh explained that the deductions were made by the office of the Accountant-General of the Federation (OAGF) through the Integrated Personnel and Payroll System (IPPIS). The spokesman said the affected employees were overpaid in December 2019 due to a “system error”, hence the deductions to recover the over-payment. He said: “The attention of the corps management has been drawn to diverse allegations of fraud and misappropriation of funds by a number of aggrieved personnel who felt short-changed due to some deductions in their salary. “This is coming barely one week after the payment of January salary by the office of the Accountant-General of the Federation, through IPPIS. “The corps wishes to set the records straight that the business of salary payment is that of the Accountant-General of the Federation, and not the management of the NSCDC. “It is unfair to accuse the corps’ leadership of tampering with salary of personnel at a time the management is making concerted effort to ensure better welfare packages for the personnel. That has consistently been the priority. “The deductions were carried out exclusively by IPPIS to recover all funds overpaid by them to some workers in December due to a system error. “Now, IPPIS has deducted the over-payment in full and returned same to government coffers in January.”
