 INVESTMENT in water transportation as a component of the multi- modal transport system is key to meeting the mobility needs of Lagos State, its Commissioner of Transportation, Dr. Frederic Oladeinde, has said. He said meeting the transportation needs of a city like Lagos with an estimated population of over 22 million required solid investments by both the public and private sectors. Speaking in Lagos, during the launch of waterways cleanup campaign by the Lagos State Waterways Authority (LASWA), Oladeinde said investment in Lagos waterways was imperative as part of strategies to unlock traffic gridlock in the metropolis.
