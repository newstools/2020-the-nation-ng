A High Court in Nyanya, Abuja on Thursday jailed one Obinna Echanu, 42, for killing an Uber driver identified as Edwin Ali. Ali was killed in Abuja on December 26, 2016. Justice Peter Kekemeke, who delivered the judgment, convicted Echanu for armed robbery and culpable homicide. However, Echanu’s co-accused, Everly Nnorom, 27, was acquitted for lack of evidence. Convicting Echanu of the offences, the judge held that the police proved counts of armed robbery and culpable homicide against Echanu beyond reasonable doubt. The judge also ordered that a Sienna car and the revolver recovered from the convict be forfeited to the Federal Government. He also ordered that the deceased person’s phone recovered from him should be returned to his family.
