The Deputy Governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the November 16th Bayelsa state Governorship election and a serving Senator, Biobarakuma Degi-Eremienyo has given a seven-day ultimatum to a People’s Democratic Party (PDP) Chieftain in Bayelsa state, Miebi Bribena, to retract a defamatory statement he made against him. Bribena had alleged that Distinguished Senator Degi-Eremienyo faced court litigation on grounds of falsification and forgery of Certificate in 1990 while featuring on a popular current affairs programme on a national television, ‘Focus Nigeria’. A Media aide to the Senator, Mr. Ebinimi Omubo, in a statement, expressed regrets over the manner in which some politicians have become extremely desperate without iota of moral in their accumulation of lies just to appease their pay masters. According to the statement, “to keep the records straight, it will be recalled that Senator Degi’s victory at the said election Bribena referred to in 1990 was not challenged in any court of law by the candidate, (now) Late Michael Inemo John”. The statement added further that, “Degi has never faced any criminal charge in his career; both in public or private life. Bribena by this statement should be ready for the worst legal battle of his life as this will model his mind to speak only the truth but not lying for political patronage”.
