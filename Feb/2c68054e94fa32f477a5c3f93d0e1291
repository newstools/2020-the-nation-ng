Behind the façade called street protest by some stalwarts of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is a looming implosion to remove the National Chairman of the party, Prince Uche Secondus. And the last straw Secondus is clinging to is the street protest to prove that he has been providing a responsive leadership. Party leaders, especially governors are tired of Secondus because of the performance of the party in the last general election and standalone polls in Kogi and Bayelsa among others.  The aggrieved leaders vented their spleen at the National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting of the party when only eight PDP governors attended the session. Even at that, to save his face, the PDP national chairman was combative (like a trade union leader) at the session when it was evident he was talking to a deaf audience. But despite Secondus make-up, PDP governors and some influential leaders are already shopping for a new national chairman from the South-West. Top on the list is a former Governor of Osun State, Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola, who was disgraced out of the party as its National Secretary. It was learnt that high-stake consultations have started on the future of the party beyond Secondus. It is left to see how Secondus will weather the storm. A PDP stalwart told SENTRY: “The battle for 2023 is beginning internally within our party through massive house cleansing. We won’t take things for granted any more. If our leaders are to choose between Secondus and Oyinlola, I can tell you that Oyinlola will receive an overwhelming support. “Even the Board of Trustees (BOT) will be sanitized. Enough is enough.”
