The Ekiti State Chief Judge, Justice Ayodeji Daramola has granted amnesty to 44 immates and bail to three others who were awaiting trial in the state. Daramola who gave the amnesty during a tour ofÂ  Ado-Ekiti Correctional centres, said the excercise was aimed at decongesting the bloated facility.

The Chief Judge said 420 cases comprising 413 males and seven females were reviewed, where those charged with lesser offences ranging from stealing, burglary and others were released. Daramola expressed optimism that the released inmates would have learnt their lessons, imploring them to turn a new leaf and be good citizens. He also admonished lawyers to be mindful of politically motivated cases to avoid their images from being dented. The Chief Judge applauded the comptroller of the Correctional Services, Mr Afolabi Akinyemi, for taking good care of the inmates as well as keeping the environment clean and healthy.
