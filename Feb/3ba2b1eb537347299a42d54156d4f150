Interswitch Limited, a technology-driven company with a focus on the digitisation of payments in Nigeria and other African countries, at the weekend listed its N23 billion bond on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE). The callable senior unsecured bond, with a tenor of seven years, at a fixed rate of 15 percent, was part of a N30 billion debt issuance programme issued through a special purpose vehicle – Interswitch Africa One Plc. Group Managing Director and founder, Interswitch Limited, Mr. Mitchell Elegbe said the company was delighted with its capital raising efforts. He noted that Interswitch has evolved over the past 17 years into a technology unicorn focused on providing digital solutions to customers in Nigeria and across Africa. “We, therefore, see this listing as a first step in a new phase of our journey and we are determined to keep going,” Elegbe said. NSE Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Oscar Onyema, said the Exchange was pleased to be a partner to Interswitch Limited in its quest to expand its footprints by raising fresh capital. “We see a win for Interswitch as a win for Nigeria. As a sustainable Exchange and a premiere listing destination, we are committed to supporting our issuers with tailored financing options that will place them in a vantage position to compete in the regional and global markets,” Onyema said.
