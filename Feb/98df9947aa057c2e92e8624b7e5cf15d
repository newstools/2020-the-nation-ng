Ex Big Brother Naija house mate Nina Ivy over the weekend got married and has taken positive measures to keep her private life off social media by refusing to post pictures of her husband. Though the reality star and actress tweeted on January 1st, 2020 that one of the best things that happened to her in 2019 was finding love, her fans were not expecting her to get hooked so soon. Nina’s wedding post came to her fans as a bombshell as she posted series of pictures from her wedding on her Instagram, she however tweeted “People been working overtime to see my hubby, sorry darlings you all would never. Yesterday was the best day of my life,” she wrote. Some fans congratulated her while some trolled her tagging the wedding as an ‘audio wedding’. “I traditionally wedded the love of my life,” she captioned one of the pictures. She added that fans can now address her as a married woman using the title “Mrs A.”
