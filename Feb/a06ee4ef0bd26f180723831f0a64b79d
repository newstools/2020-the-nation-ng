By Gabriel Ogunjobi President Muhammadu Buhari has established a committee that will study and address the recent United States travel ban on Nigeria and five other countries, with a view of expunging the country from the list. The US had on Friday announced travel restrictions on six countries, which included Nigeria, alongside Belarus, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar, Sudan and Tanzania. For Nigeria came in spite of the country’s failure to comply with its established identity-management and information-sharing criteria. In reaction to this development, Femi Adesina, the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, revealed in a press release signed on Saturday afternoon that the Nigerian President ‘has established a committee, to be chaired by the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola to study and address updated U.S. requirements relating to the assessment of compliance with certain security criteria by foreign government.’ ‘The committee will work with the U.S Government, International Police Organisation (Interpol) and other stakeholders to ensure all updates are properly implemented. ‘Nigeria remains committed to maintaining productive relations with the United States and other international allies especially on matters of global security’, Mr Adesina noted.
