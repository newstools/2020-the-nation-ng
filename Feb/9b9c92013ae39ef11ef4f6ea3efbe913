 THE leadership of Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba-Akoko (AAUA),  Ondo State  has unveiled a scheme on alleviating the hardship of her students. This was made known to CAMPUSLIFE during an interview with the university’s Head of Counselling Unit Mr Mapayi Victor. According to him, the scheme would target three categories of students – the indigents, indigenes and physically challenged. He said: “The first category is for the physically challenged students while the second category is based on merit, as students who are on four points above or the best student from each department. The third category is for the indigent students. These are the categories we work with. Also those who are not buoyant to pay their institution fees and do not fall under any of the mentioned categories can also request for loans which has also be programmed by the management.” Mapayi said interested student across the three categories could to visit the university website and fill a form online. “There is a website where you visit to fill the form and after filling, you print it out. Students can also visit the site to get information and scholarships offered by the school.” Further, Mapayi noted that management had set up a committee that oversees the scholarship programme. He berated students for exhibiting impatience in going through a rare piece of information such as scholarship scheme. He, therefore, urged the students to pay attention to highlights and information on notice boards. “The link to the site is well written at the front door in the counseling unit but students don’t pay attention to what is important. “The only thing that interest most students is night clubs which shouldn’t be. They ignore programmes that have to do with their future. They hardly pay attention to them,” he said.
