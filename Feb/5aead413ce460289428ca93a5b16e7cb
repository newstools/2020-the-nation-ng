BRITISH supermodel, businesswoman, and philanthropist, Naomi Campbell, was recently honored by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) with the Global Advocacy Award at the 19th annual Greater New York Gala. The event held last Saturday at the New York Marriott Marquis, New York. Campbell was recognised based on her global relief efforts which support homelessness, poverty, HIV/Aids, world hunger and equality for all people.  While accepting her honour, the 49-year-old activist who donned a draping gown by Lebanese designer, Zuhair Murad, said: “This journey that I am on gives me a sense of fulfillment. When I committed to doing this work, I was not aware of the difficult tasks ahead but I did realize one thing, I wanted to give back to communities of all various circumstances, all the things that I had to fight for in my own life – to be seen, to be heard, to be included, to be accepted and to be given hope when it seems there is none.”
