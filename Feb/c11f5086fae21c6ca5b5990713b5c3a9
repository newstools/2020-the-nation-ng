The Patriotic Forum of Niger Delta (PAFOND) has called on the governors of the six states in the South-south zone to emulate their counterparts in the Southwest zone, who put in place Amotekun, by establishing their special security outfit. It noted that the security outfit by governors in the South-south zone in the hitherto volatile Niger Delta region would go a long way to protect lives and properties of people in the strategic zone. PAFOND, yesterday in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital, in a six-point communique issued at the end of the National Executive Council (NEC) meeting and signed by its national chairman, Owo Udoh, and the national secretary, Richard Monday, insisted that urgent steps must be taken on the security outfit for the South-south zone. It said: “Security of lives and properties of people of the South-south zone is more important than other interests and cannot be compromised. “The current security structure in Nigeria cannot address the security challenges in the South-south zone. It is time for governors of the six states in the South-south to start working on security, economic and infrastructural joint projects, for the growth of the zone. State governments in the South-south should pay more attention to empowerment of the people and capital-intensive projects that will boost economic activities and create jobs for the people, especially the youths.
