Suspected thugs on Friday disrupted an orientation programme for youths in Owan East Local Government Area. The programme was put together by the lawmaker representing Owan Federal Constituency, Professor Julius Ihonvbere, as part of his zonal intervention programme for his people. It was a sensitization programme on drug abuse for youths in constituency which was holding at the Michael Imoudu College of Physical Education and being carried out by the National Institute for Cultural Orientation (NICO), Federal Ministry of Information. Friday, which  was the final day of the programme,  saw suspected thugs invading  the venue and driving  the participants and organizers away. Some persons sustained injuries. A legislative aide to Ihonvbere, Mr. Ekundayo Bright, said, “It is quite unfortunate that Owan has become experimental grounds for the practice of executive rascality. Despite the total neglect and marginalization of Owan by the Godwin Obaseki administration through his actions, he ensures Owan Federal Constituency remains backward in terms of infrastructural development and  do not benefit from policies and programmes that will better the life of the constituents”. Chairman of Owan East Local Government, Andrew Osigwe, who was fingered as being the brain behind the activities of the thugs, said he sent policemen to shut down the place. Speaking on phone yesterday, Osigwe said: “Is it proper for them to organise such a programme without informing me? What if something went wrong? It was security agencies that drew my attention to the presence of people in that place, they did not inform us. Am I not supposed to even attend with my executive and add colour to the event as the chief security office of the council? Is that how things are done?”
