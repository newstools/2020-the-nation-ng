The National Business and Technical Examinations Board (NABTEB) on Wednesday released results of the 2019 November/December Ordinary and Advanced levels certificate examinations. The board said it had maintained credible examinations by strengthening its quality assurance mechanisms to checkmate malpractices. Its Registrar/Chief Executive, Professor Ifeoma M. Isiugo-Abanihe, announced the release of the results at a media briefing in Benin, the Edo State capital. She said 32,349 out of 50,040 candidates who registered for the examination scored five Credits and above, including English language and Mathematics. Isiugo-Abanihe said a total of 40,605 candidates, representing 91.52 per cent, scored five Credits and above, with or without English and Mathematics. The NABTEB boss said this yearâ€™s performance was statistically the same with the 2018 November/December results. She said 603 candidates, representing about 1.22 per cent out of a total 49,302 candidates, were involved in malpractices during the conduct of the examination. Isiugo-Abanihe added that the principal objective of TVET was to train youths and adults as well as prepare them for the labour market and academic progression. She called for the establishment of more Federal science and technical colleges (FSTCs) while ensuring that existing ones are adequately equipped.
