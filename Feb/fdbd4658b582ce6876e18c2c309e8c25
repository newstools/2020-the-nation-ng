Procurement officers should be committed to the T.H.E.M.E.S agenda of the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration, the General Manager, Lagos State Public Procurement Agency (LSPPA), Mr. Fatai Idowu Onafowote, has said. Onafowote, who spoke at the opening of a three-day procurement planning clinic, organised by the agency, said that the programme was an annual event designed by the agency to fine-tune the annual procurement plans of each of the Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), to ascertain that they are in tandem with the approved budget. He said: “As the regulator of public procurement in the state, LSPPA has the responsibility of ensuring that the procurement plans prepared by the MDAs are in tandem with the approved budget, thus it is determined to ensure that the MDAs procurement plans are prepared in such a way that the objectives envisaged by the government, as reflected in the budget, are achieved.” Onafowote said this year’s planning clinic would not be different, adding that it was designed to scrutinise and review the procurement plans of each ministries, departments and agencies. He said within the three days, the procurement officers would present the procurement plans of their MDAs for scrutiny and review by resource persons appointed by the agency. “I wish to acknowledge the unflinching support the agency has been receiving from Governor Sanwo-Olu and I assure him that the agency is committed to his T.H.E.M.E.S agenda. We will ensure best practices in all public procurement processes of the government,” Onafowote said
