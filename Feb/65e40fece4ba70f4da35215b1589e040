Four officers of the Kogi State Command of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC) were reportedly kidnapped on Thursday around Ajegwu, Ofu LG, by unknown gunmen. The officers were said to be on their way to Benue State, to attend a promotion examination. A source close to one of the victims said that the officers were traveling in an official vehicle when they were cornered and kidnapped around the Ajegwu Junction, along the Itobe-Anyigba. The source who pleaded anonymity added that a fifth person escaped while they were being marched into the bush. He added that the kidnappers have already established contact with the families of the victims, and are demanding N30 million ransom for their release. It would be recalled that 10 persons were abducted along the same axis, on Sunda, while six persons including a student of the Nigeria Law School, were similarly kidnapped along the Obajana-Kabba road. When contacted, the Corps Commandant of the state command, Mr. Peter Samuel Maigeri said he could not confirm the development. He said that he will get back to our correspondent as soon as clearer information on the incident is made available to him. The State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Williams Ayah, however, confirmed the development. Ayah, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), said that more than four persons including the NSCDC fell victims to the abductors, just as he promised to update our correspondent on the development.
