It plans to honour them for their commitments towards uplifting and caring for people living with disabilities. The group’s Coordinator, Comrade Kehinde Oshilaja, in a statement said that the event would hold on February 14. He said his group deemed it fit to honour Asiwaju Tinubu and others because they had distinguished themselves as people with large hearts, who prioritised the welfare of people living with disabilities. Oshilaja said the award was a way of reciprocating the feat achieved “by these people and organisations.” “We as a group thought it incumbent on us to show our appreciation by bestowing on them these honours and awards.” He hailed former governor Fashola for his achievements in Lagos, saying during his tenure, he not only catered for the less privileged, but also established an agency, the Lagos Office for Disability Affairs (LASODA), saddled with the responsibility of taking care and monitoring the welfare of people living with disabilities.
