Ericsson has launched AI-powered Energy Infrastructure Operations, a new energy management solution that leverages artificial intelligence and advanced data analytics to optimize energy consumption across network infrastructure for communications service providers. Integrated into the Ericsson Operations Engine, the company’s AI-based, data-driven approach enables service providers to reduce OPEX and CO2 emissions from their networks while maximizing site availability. Speaking via a press statement, SVP and Head of Business, Peter Laurin said the technology creates energy efficiencies on the radio network, where most savings can be achieved. “The new solution not only addresses site-related energy savings, but also operational efficiencies to enable less site visits to be performed, ultimately resulting in CO2 emission reduction across multiple layers. “Deployment of AI-powered Energy Infrastructure Operations can achieve 15 percent decrease in energy-related OPEX; 15 percent reduction in site visits related to passive infrastructure; and 30 percent reduction of energy related outages,” he said. Saying that the Energy Infrastructure Operations solution has been trialed with customers in Europe Asia, Europe Middle East and Latin America Laurin said it is currently live in Telenor Myanmar’s network. “We see a strong focus from our customers on reducing energy consumption as they look to make their operations more efficient and improve their carbon footprint. “Our Energy Infrastructure Operations offering is an innovative solution with different efficiency scenarios to address different needs,” he noted.
