 The Ekiti State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has rejected plan by  former governor Ayodele Fayose and some elders in the party to pick a consensus candidate ahead of the coming congress slated for April 2. It was gathered that Fayose’s camp were making an arrangement to scheme in favour of anointed chairmanship candidate, Bisi Kolawole, to emerge as a consensus candidate in order to take over the party’s structure ahead of the 2022 governorship election in the state.  PDP has for some time been polarised over leadership issue between Fayose and Senator Biodun Olujimi. The Oguntuase-led SWC, in a statement yesterday by the party’s Publicity Secretary, Mr. Jackson Adebayo, said the plan was ill-motivated and ill-conceived, describing it as unacceptable. Fayose and his loyalists were said to have met on February 21 at the home of one of the party’s leaders, Senator Clement Awoyelu, in Ado-Ekiti, where the arrangement of a consensus chairmanship candidate was conceived.
