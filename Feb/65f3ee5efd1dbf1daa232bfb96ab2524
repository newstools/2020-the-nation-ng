From Adekunle Jimoh, Ilorin Kwara State All Progressives Congress (APC) has warned those it described as agents of destabilisation the party. Therefore, the party urged its members to disregard any call from any quarters for the composition of a new set of party executives. In a statement, the APC chairman, Bashir Bolarinwa, described an impostor and agent of destruction “as anyone tinkering with the list or engaging in the composition of party executive members in the state APC”. There has been no love lost between the APC executives and Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq.  The unsavory relationship has made some loyalists of the governor to call for the resignation of Bolarinwa as chair. Bolarinwa said: “Nobody is empowered at any level to tinker with the list or compose any new party executives of APC as of the moment as there was no need for such. I Bolarinwa as the state chairman reaffirms that all executive members of the party at all levels, ward, local and state remain sacrosanct and undisputable. “I therefore call on those who are on the mission to destabilise the party to have a rethink, retrace their steps and succumb to party rules in accordance with our constitution which remains supreme in running the party. I remain, for the purpose of emphasis, the only source for the authentication of exco members of Kwara APC.”
