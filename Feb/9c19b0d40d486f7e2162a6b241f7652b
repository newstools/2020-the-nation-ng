 A YET-to-be identified police officer is on the run after his lover died while they were allegedly making love in the room of the deceased in Ado Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital. A source who craved anonymity told The Nation that the incident happened Wednesday night. The suspect, who was a lover to the deceased was said to have visited Ekiti from Lagos, where he works as a policeman. Confirming the incident, the  police spokesman Sunday Abutu said one of the neighbours to the dead lady reported the case at the Oke Ila Divisional Police Station, and his men swung into action. “The lady died inside her room and one of her neighbours reported at our office at Oke Ila in Ado Ekiti. “Our detectives immediately visited the house and saw the lifeless body of the lady. The body has been evacuated and taken to the morgue of the Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital,” he stated. He added that the suspect has been arrested and detained in the police custody. Abutu, however, clarified that the identity of the man and his profession remained sketchy. “We are yet to know whether he is a policeman or not. Let us wait for the outcome of our investigation, it will reveal all that,” Abutu said.
