AMERICAN musician ElizabethX, whose real name is Rahaile Foday, is set to release her debut single “Xsistence” in February. On why she named her debut EP “Xsistence” and how she came up with the name ElizabethX, the 26 year old singer/songwriter who turns a year older on February 6, said: “Initially a few names bounced around, from XZENA to Victory Cruise, but ElizabethX. was settled on.” According to the artiste, it was in the memory of her aunt whose middle name was Elizabeth and who also enjoyed singing. ElizabethX’s music is influenced by her childhood trauma, poor relationship with her parents, her dreams, world travels, heartbreaks, inner exploration, and abstract thoughts of the world around her. “The songs on my EP are a mixture of my life experiences, dreams and my existence here in this world in my adult life,” she said, set to take her audience on a music journey which she believes would be timeless. “Xsistence is a play on the word existence using X instead of E since I’m ElizabethX.” The musician whose dad is from Ghana and mom is from Liberia, has a strong background which is linked to music as her mom plays the violin too.
