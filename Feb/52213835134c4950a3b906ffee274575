 THERE is no on-going recruitment of cadet assistant superintendents and cadet inspectors, the Police Service Commission (PSC) said on Wednesday in a statement by its Head, Press and Public Relations, Ikechukwu Ani. The commission cautioned Nigerians against falling for conmen who may want to extort them by promising to assist in job placements. Ani said: “The Commission notes that it is in possession of messages and requests to notable Nigerians informing them of a phantom recruitment exercise and asking them to send three names for recruitment. The messages were purported to have originated from the Honourable Chairman of the Commission, Musiliu Smith, a retired Inspector General of Police. “The fraudsters according to information in the Commission’s possession, are requesting from their contacts, payments to some account names and numbers of different Nigerian banks. “The Commission is deeply embarrassed that fraudsters associate the name of the Commission’s Chairman with this fraudulent disposition. “It is also instructive to note that recruitment in the Commission is handled by the Commission as a body and not by individuals. The Chairman only chairs the meetings where decisions of the Commission, including that of recruitment, are taken. “The Commission warns that Nigerians should beware of these fraudsters who are on the prowl to dupe unsuspecting citizens.”
