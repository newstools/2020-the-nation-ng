American Pop Super Star, Lady Gaga, while dropping her first solo single and video in nearly three years, says she has quit smoking. The single, titled `Stupid Love’, was released at midnight on February 28, in a return to her eighties electro-dance pop glory. In “Stupid Love,” the star sang about unwillingly wanting love; the music video opens with dramatic music and a card that reads, `The world rots in conflict’. The pop superstar, 33, opened up about her forthcoming album and one of her personal demons she’s been battling for years while promoting her new song later in the day. “I’m not smoking anymore, but I’d smoked 40 cigarettes all day long,’ she said during an interview on New Music Daily with Zane Lowe on Apple Music. The star was last seen smoking as recently as February 18. She then tried to use her personal experience as a serial quitter to deter fans and listeners not to pick up cigarettes. “If you don’t smoke, don’t smoke! Because quitting is worse and brutal. “I will never smoke again because I think I saw Jesus for an entire week. “This was very emotional for me making this album and I cried constantly and I was writing poetry constantly,’’ Gaga said. According to her, “I put all my heart, pain and messages from the other realm that I hear into music; I want people to dance and feel happy. “I will like to put out music that a big chunk of the world will hear, and it will become a part of their daily lives and make them happy every single day.” The upcoming album will be her first solo effort since 2016’s `Joanne’ which leaned on country and soft rock elements. Born Stefani Germanotta, Gaga is considered one of the world’s best-selling artist. She has 11 Grammy awards over her career dating back to her debut album `The Fame’ in 2008, which was reissued the following year as The Fame Monster. (NAN)
