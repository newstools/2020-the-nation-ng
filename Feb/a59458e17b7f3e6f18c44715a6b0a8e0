From Sanni Onogu, Abuja, AbdulGafar Aalabelewe, Kaduna  Deputy Senate President Ovie Omo-Agege has described Kaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai as a consistent and reform-minded performer. In a letter he personally signed on El-Rufai’s 60th birthday, the senator noted that many Nigerians appreciate the governor’s noble qualities within and outside his state. El-Rufai’s lawyer AbdulHakeem Mustapha (SAN) said the governor has 83 certificates from Harvard University in the United States of America (U.S.A).  The lawyer said he was shocked the day he saw the governor’s certificates. “There was a time El-Rufa’i was dragged to court for not having certificates. And as we were about to get to the court that day, he dropped me in his car and handed me a bulky envelope. “When I opened the envelope, I discovered he had 83 certificates from Harvard. And when I asked him how? He said: ‘A.U, when my peers were busy buying exotic cars, houses and other luxurious things, this is what I was doing with my money,’” he said. Also, Oba Ogunwusi yesterday said Nigeria needs leaders like El-Rufai. He described the Kaduna State governor as a small-statured man with massive engine that can pull anything to achieve result. The monarch added that Nigeria needs leaders who can take tough decisions to achieve great results.
