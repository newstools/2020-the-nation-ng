Most people know Segun Adebutu as Chief Executive Officer of Petrolex Oil and Gas, and a son of billionaire businessman, Chief Kessington Adebutu, better known as Baba Ijebu. But he is more than that. Through Oladiran Olusegun Adebutu (OOA) Foundation, he has found a way to touch the lives of orphans and kids with special needs. His belief is that every child deserves a chance to succeed in life regardless of his or her background. He is set to feed 300 children through OOA Foundation, founded in 2014 but officially launched in 2016. Last December, the oil mogul brought smiles to the faces of orphans and vulnerable children, and renovated the School of Special Needs in Kwara State. Tagged the Impact Investment Network, the gesture was in partnership with Petrolex Group and it was was aimed at empowering 245 persons. Motorcycles, deep freezers, generators, water pumping machines, hairdryers, barbing equipment sets, and farming equipment and other items were given out. It was also gathered that, in partnership with Jump Africa, OOA sent a top representative to New York to purchase books and learning materials, which were distributed to orphans and other vulnerable children.
