By Damisi Ojo, Akure Ahead of October 10 governorship election in Ondo State, the lawmaker representing Ondo North Senatorial District, Prof. Ajayi Boroffice, has said the Unity Group in the All Progressives Congress (APC) will present a consensus governorship aspirant for the primaries. Boroffice, who is also the Deputy Senate Leader, spoke at the weekend in Akure during an empowerment for women in Ondo Central and South senatorial districts. The Unity Group is an aggrieved forum formed as a result of the last governorship primaries that produced Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu as the party’s standard-bearer in 2017. Boroffice said: “We in Unity Group of APC in Ondo State will have one person to vie for the primaries. It may be Chief Olusola Oke, Jimi Odimayo, Ife Oyedele, Olusegun Abraham, Bukola Adetula or anybody in the group since we have a common goal of presenting a credible candidate for the party in the coming election.” He, however, urged the women to remain resolute and firm to the party, saying better days would soon come. The Special Assistant to Governor Akeredolu on Media and Publicity, Ojo Oyewamide, said last night that the governor was not bothered about whoever or whatever group that desired to present a consensus candidate. He said: “The issue is simple and it is… Governor Akeredolu will return to office and spend another term in office as governor.  The same God that made it possible in 2016 will make it still. No gang up of whatever form will stop the governor. Our focus is clear and the mission is unwavering. The entire infrastructural space in the state has changed and the people of the state know the difference. We wish them good luck.”
