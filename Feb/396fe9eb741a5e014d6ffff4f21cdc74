The ousted Bayelsa State Governor-elect, Chief David Lyon, has rejected the judgement of the Supreme Court that stopped his swearing-in. He said it was wrong for Senator Douye Diri of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to have been inaugurated as the state governor saying he did not meet the constitutionally electoral requirements for inauguration as directed by the court. Speaking through a member representing Southern Ijaw Federal Constituency in the National Assembly, Preye Oseke, described the judgement as shocking and procured. He said the APC and the people of Bayelsa totally rejected the judgement and called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) not to issue certificate of return to Diri. Lyon argued that even based on the pronouncement of the court, Diri was not qualified to be sworn-in as he failed to meet the constitutionally required geographical spread in the election. He said: As a people and party, we are rejecting the judgement completely. It is a procured judgement. While we have our respect for our revered justices, we believe that this is not the wish of Bayelsans. “We are calling on INEC not to issue certificate of return  to the candidate of the PDP because the candidate of the PDP was unable to score the required 25 per cent in the two third of the local government areas. “As a party, we are law abiding. Our properties had been destroyed even in the midst of the judgement. But we are calling on all our party supporters to remain calm while our leaders, stakeholders meet and come up with the next line of action. “We  believe that the right thing will be done and the the rule of law will be upheld”.
