 The beneficiaries of the Badagry Local Government free Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) forms of the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB) in the local government area have been advised to strive towards excellence in the forthcoming university admission examination in order to qualify for admission. The chairman of the local government, Hon. Olusegun Onilude, gave this charge during the week, while presenting the forms to qualified indigent students in the secondary schools in the area. The council boss, who reiterated the resolve of his administration at improving the standard of education in the council area, said his administration would continue to give free UTME forms to qualified indigent students in the council area from time to time. “This exercise is a continuous one. The last time we were here, we gave out educational materials that will help you in your forthcoming General Certificate Examination (GCE) and West African Examination Council ( W A E C)  examination. Today again, we are giving out free U T M E, J A M B forms because not all parents can afford the cost implications, “ he said. Onilude assured the students of his administration’s support to those who perform excellently well in the examination to secure admission.
