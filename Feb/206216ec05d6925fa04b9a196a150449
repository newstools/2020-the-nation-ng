Bassey Anthony, Uyo A former Deputy Inspector General of police, Udom Ekpoudom, (rtd.) has said that Nigeria’s Armed Forces and the police are not well equipped to tackle the raging insecurity in the country. In an interaction with journalists Monday in Uyo, the ex-DIG, said the calls from some quarters for the removal of service chiefs were misplaced as it won’t solve the security challenges. “I don’t think that removing the service Chiefs is the problem. That might be part of it, but our biggest problem is that the Armed forces and the police are not well equipped. “If they are not well equipped, you done expect them to perform magic. Let us copy from what other countries are doing and equip our security agencies adequately. “If you remove the Service Chiefs one hundred times and fail to give them the necessary equipment you have not changed anything,” he said. He called for a review of the salaries and allowances of the parliamentarians, insisting that if this was not done peace would continue to elude Nigeria He said; “The problem we are having in Nigeria is that we are laying wrong emphasis on wrong things. How do we spend most of our resources on National Assembly members? “The money they take home every day is just too much. If the salaries and allowances of these parliamentarians is not cut down to fund security issues, Nigeria will not see peace. “I worked with the Nigeria police for many years and I know that our problem is lack of equipment,” he said.
