 LAGOS State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has reiterated his readiness to make nurses and midwives excel in their professions with constant training and retraining. He spoke yesterday in Lekki, Lagos at a retreat organised by the Lagos State College of Nursing, Midwifery and Public Health Nursing, Igando. The theme of the event was: “Collegiate Nursing Education, Prospects, Implementation, Challenges and Way Forward”. The governor, represented by his Special Adviser on Education, Mr. Tokunbo Wahab, said that as part of his administration’s determination to achieve its desired goal, training and retraining of workers was one of its cardinal points. He urged the beneficiaries to reciprocate government’s gesture because, according to him, to whom much is given, much is expected. The Provost, Mrs. Oyefunso Orenuga, said that the training was the first they were having since their relocation to Igando, adding that it was aimed at preparing them for the journey ahead. She said the health sector should be manned to yield the desired result, adding that the government should engage nurses in leadership position, including policy formulation and implementation. Orenuga said it had been estimated that the world would need nine million more nurses and midwives if it was to achieve universal health coverage by 2030, noting that strengthening the nursing profession would have the additional benefit of promoting gender equity, contributing to economic development and supporting other sustainable development goals. Head of Service Mr. Hakeem Muri-Okunola, represented by the Permanent Secretary, Public Service Office, Mr. Segun Ajibade, said that the government would provide subventions to be augmented by the authorities of the tertiary institutions to meet specific needs in the three cores areas, namely teaching, research and community service. He advised the participants to take advantage of the opportunity provided by the retreat to learn, unlearn and relearn.
