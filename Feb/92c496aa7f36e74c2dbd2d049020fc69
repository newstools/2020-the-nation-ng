The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) has launched a $683 million appeal to assist about 48 million women, girls and young people in 57 countries affected by conflict or natural disasters. “Women and girls pay a high price in conflicts they had no role in creating. It is time to prioritise their rights, safety and dignity in humanitarian action. During crises and conflict, violence against women and girls is staggering. Women do not stop getting pregnant and having babies when crisis strikes. We must provide them with the services and the support they need,” said Dr. Natalia Kanem, UNFPA Executive Director. UNFPA’s Humanitarian Action 2020 Overview outlines how women and girls face unique challenges during humanitarian disasters, including increased risk of death from complications of pregnancy and childbirth, and increased risk of gender-based violence (GBV).
