 THE Presidency last night described the Northern Elders’ Forum (NEF) as a mere mouthpiece of one man, Prof. Ango Abdullahi, devoid of any credible membership. Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr Femi Adesina, in a statement said Nigerians know better and “don’t need a paper tiger’ to tell them anything”. The statement said: “Professor Ango Abdullahi on Sunday signed a long-winding statement on many issues relating to the North, and purportedly to the country. “The former vice chancellor signed the statement under the banner of Northern Elders Forum (NEF). Hearing that title, you would think the body was a conglomeration of true elders. But the truth is that  NEF is just Ango Abdullahi, and Ango Abdullahi is NEF. It is a quasi-organisation that boasts of no credible membership, and its leader is akin to a General without troops. “Before the 2019 presidential election, the one-man army called NEF had shown its anti-pathy against President Muhammadu Buhari, and its preference for another candidate. They all got beaten together. “NEF is merely waving a flag that is at half-mast. President Buhari steadily and steadfastly focuses on the task of retooling Nigeria, and discerning Nigerians know the true state of the nation. They don’t need a paper tiger to tell them anything”, the statement said.
