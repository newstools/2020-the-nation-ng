The Director-General of the Directorate of Technical Aid Corps, Dr. Pius Osunyikanmi, has commiserated with Ondo State Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, and the Jegun of Ile-Oluji and Jegun in Council, Oba Oluwole Adetimehin, over the robbery that occurred in the town last Thursday. Robbers had invaded Ile-Oluji in Ile-Oluji/Oke-Igbo Local Government and attacked two banks, leaving four people dead. In a statement, Osunyikanmi described the incident as unfortunate, saying Ile-Oluji had been part of the communities that enjoyed peace. He said Governor Akeredolu had since assumption of office prioritised people’s welfare and security of life and property. The governor, he said, provided regular support for the security agencies and ensured that workers smiled to the bank every month through prompt payment of salaries, adding that the one-off incident in Ile Oluji could, therefore, not define his administration. Noting that Governor Akeredolu had made the people happy through his monumental strides in all sectors, Osunyikanmi urged him to keep up the good work. He said the reign of Oba Adetimehin had also witnessed unprecedented development, adding that “this robbery, though painful, will not affect the resolve of the community to march forward.”
