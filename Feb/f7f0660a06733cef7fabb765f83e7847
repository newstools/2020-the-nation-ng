 THE new Director-General/CEO, National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), Mr. Kashifu Abdullahi, has identified the Information Communications Technology (ICT) sector as key enabler of economic diversification. Abdullahi, who was Technical Assistant to Communications and Digital Economy Minister, Dr. Isa Pantami, who he succeeded at NITDA, said he played a crucial role in the development of a strategic plan built on seven pillars to turn around the IT sector, that also identified ICT as a key enabler for economic diversification. According to the first edition of eGovernance Nigeria Magazine published by Technology Times Media Limited, the DG  said he hoped to leave a legacy of digital transformation on completion of his duty at the regulatory agency. “I was very instrumental in implementing the strategy. So the strategy was developed for the agency for 2017-2020 and the strategy was about seven key pillars. “In 2016, my mentor and boss, Dr Pantami was appointed by the president as Director-General of NITDA, and he requested for me to join his team as Technical Assistant. Then I joined NITDA in March 2017, and worked with him to develop the strategy for the agency on how to transform the Nigerian IT sector. That time was very formative to my career because it exposed me to a lot of challenges in terms of administration and dealing with different stakeholders.”
