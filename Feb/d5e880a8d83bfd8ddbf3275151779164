By Dupe Ayinla-Olasunkanmi  Afro highlife artiste, Kene, last Friday, dropped his debut EP, titled, Ote the EP. The EP which has five tracks – Ote, Eledumare, Ada, Egwu Amala and Jide Ofor  – features artistes like KCEE, Ceeza Milli and Nationwize. The artiste whose real name is Anidiobi Kenechi Leonard hails from Udi, Enugu State. He signed a contract with Tonic Music Entertainment (TME) in 2019. Kene found love for music while in primary school where he was the go-to-child when it was time to sing folklores. He had his grandfather who told him lots of stories to thank for that. He later attended secondary school in Makurdi, Benue where he lived with an uncle who was a Roman Catholic priest. While there, he joined the choir.  After his secondary school, Kene decided to focus on his music even though his parents wanted him to be a medical doctor or lawyer. He graduated from singing with the choir to singing and performing with music groups like Achikolo, Uwaoma Boys and Palmy Udu Bunch, all in Enugu State. It was while doing a show in Udi that he was discovered by Tonic Music Entertainment (TME) in 2016. He trained at Tenstrings Music Institute in Lagos between 2017 and 2018 after which he was signed on by TME as an artiste in 2019. During all of this, he perfected his skills in playing the piano and self-taught himself to play the saxophone, using YouTube videos. While Kene said he loves Afro highlife because “it is rooted in sounds created by our fathers” and enjoys listening to Celestine Ukwu, Osita Osadebe and Oliver de Coque, his songs have been likened to those of highlife star Flavour whom he refers to as “my big bro in Naija music.”
