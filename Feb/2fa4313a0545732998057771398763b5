 THE Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) is set to validate the capacity of the Lagos University of Teaching Hospital (LUTH) to test for the novel Coronavirus. NCDC’s Director-General, Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu, announced this in his Twitter handle. NAN reports that LUTH is one of the five functional molecular laboratories for testing samples from the Southwest. The centre said the five laboratories have the capacity to diagnose Lassa fever and that each laboratory costs about N100 million to equip initially and millions of naira to maintain functionality. “We have set up capacity to make diagnosis of Coronavirus in Abuja and would do the same in Lagos this week. Lagos and Abuja are our main points of entry,” Ihekweazu said. He also said the centre had agreed on an initial national case definition to identify suspected cases. The NCDC, Port Health Services and State Epidemiologists are aware of the process for identification and confirmation. “We will review these criteria as additional information on nCoV2019 when it becomes available,” Ihekweazu said. The director-general said NCDC had given advisories to Nigerians on the novel Coronavirus and how to protect themselves. The centre has also published frequently asked questions on the novel coronavirus to keep Nigerians informed. “Since the emergence of the novel Coronavirus, we have been working everyday to learn as quickly as possible about this new virus. “Ongoing research on its transmissibility and virulence will determine our response across Nigeria,” he added.
