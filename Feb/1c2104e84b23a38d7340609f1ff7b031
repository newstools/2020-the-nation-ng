A new strategic investor, LeapFrog III Nigeria Insurance Holdings Limited, has acquired 38.83 per cent major equity stake in AIICO Insurance Plc. The acquisition was consummated through a private placement. AIICO Insurance offered 4.4 billion ordinary shares of 50 kobo each to LeapFrog at N1.20 per share. The additional shares issued under the private placement increased AIICO Insuranceâ€™s issued share capital from 6.93 billion ordinary shares of 50 kobo each to 11.33 billion ordinary shares of 50 kobo each. The newly issued shares have been listed at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), formally concluding the acquisition process. Shareholders of AIICO Insurance had at the annual general meeting in 2016 authorised the board of directors to raise new capital to bolster the operations of the insurance company. The new equity fund will boost the capital base of AIICO Insurance as the Nigerian insurance industry sets deadline of December 31, 2020 for new minimum capital base for various insurance functions. Insurance companies are in a hot race to raise new equity capital to meet new minimum capital requirements for various insurance functions as directed by the National Insurance Commission (NAICOM). NAICOM had in May 2019 released new capital requirements for insurance businesses with a 13-month compliance period for operators to shore up their minimum capital base to the required level. The minimum paid-up share capital of a life insurance company was increased from N2 billion to N8 billion, non-life insurance from N3 billion to N10 billion, composite insurance from N5 billion to N18 billion while re-insurance companies were directed to raise their capital base from N10 billion to N20 billion. Many insurance companies had recently raised new equity capital in what was regarded as the first round of the capital raising session for the industry.
