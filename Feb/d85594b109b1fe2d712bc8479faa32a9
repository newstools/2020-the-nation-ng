No fewer than seven internet fraud suspects have been arrested in both Rivers and Abia states, the Port Harcourt zonal office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has said. A statement from the anti-graft agency in Port Harcourt said three of the suspects were arrested at their hideout in Port Harcourt in the early hours of Tuesday, February 4, while four others were picked up at a hotel in Umuahia on Monday. The EFCC noted that the “operation was based on actionable intelligence on their alleged involvement in internet fraud which was supported by surveillance on their hideouts.” The Commission further stated that “preliminary investigation has  indicated that the suspects, particularly those arrested in Port Harcourt were neck-deep in bitcoin scam.” The EFCC listed the items recovered from the suspects to include one Apple laptop, one Lenovo laptop, one Infinix Hot 6 Pro, two Infinix Hot 6, one Intel P31, one iPhone 5, two iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 11. They affirmed that the suspects will be arraigned in court as soon as investigation is concluded.
