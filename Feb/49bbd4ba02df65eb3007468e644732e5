Odion Ighalo made his European debut from the bench in Manchester United’s 1-1 away draw to Club Brugge in the Europa League on Thursday. Super Eagles forward, Emmanuel Bonaventure Dennis opened scoring in the 15th minute with a brilliant chip over United’s goalkeeper Sergio Romero while Anthony Martial, who Ighalo replaced in the 67th minute, equalised in the 36th minute. The former Nigeria international arrived at Old Trafford on loan from Chinese Super League side Shanghai Greenland Shenhua earlier last week and made his United debut as a substitute in the 2-0 away win at Chelsea on Monday. United acquired Ighalo on the last day of the January transfer window to help offset issues up front. Those issues relate to a lack of experienced cover behind centre-forward Anthony Martial, as well as Marcus Rashford who is injured.
