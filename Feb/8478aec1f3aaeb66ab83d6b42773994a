 At least one person was killed and others injured in violence that broke out on Friday following the convention of the Ijaw Youths Council (IYC) held in Sagbama Local Government Area, Bayelsa State. It was learnt that the unidentified youth was murdered at the venue of the convention, which was organised to constitute an electoral committee for the forthcoming IYC Worldwide election. Sources said crisis broke out during the convention after some youths opposed members of the electoral committee chaired by a lawyer, Bekewei Ajuwa. Confirming the incident, the Chairman IYC, Central Zone, described it as unfortunate and blamed it on the activities of cultists. He said the convention was already rounding off when some youths began a violent protest against members of the electoral committee. He condemned the incident and warned some stakeholders against bringing cultism into the activities of the IYC. He said: “Apart from the killing, which was caused by activities of some cultists, the convention was concluded and the eleco was also constituted. “Some persons felt they were not comfortable with the eleco members and instead of being civil in their grievance, they went violent. “In IYC, we have warned repeatedly against turning our activities into a theatre of war. We have also warned stakeholders against bringing cultism into our activities.”
