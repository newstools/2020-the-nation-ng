 A Non Governmental Organisation under the auspices of Equity Alliance has expressed concern over the slow pace of some federal government road constructions awarded in Zamfara, Kaduna and Katsina states, citing the rising insecurity in northwest. The group mentioned those roads to include Zaria-Hunkuyi-Kafur-Gidam Mutum daya Malumfashi Road in Kaduna and Katsina states. The other road is Birnin Gwari-Dan Gulbi Road in Kaduna and Zamfara states respectively. The group’s coordinator, Magaji A. Baba, in a statement issued in Kaduna, expressed shock over the rate at which the work is going, particularly Birni Gwari-Dan Gulbi road. According to him, ?”We are surprised to discover that the road construction slowed down due to lack of proper security in Birnin Gwari in Kaduna to Dan gulbi in Zamfara State. We urge the federal executive arm of government and the legislative to work together and provide maximum security for the company staff working around these areas.” Magaji also called for urgent release of funds to the companies to re-mobilise them to site because some construction companies absconded from the sites. He explained that the group believes SKY, which was one of the companies working on the roads, may not be able to undertake the construction due to poor rate of total value of the contract compared to the one given to another company named Proportion Construction & Dredge Works Nig Ltd. He urged the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing to review the contract and quickly fund it, so that the company could be more proactive and complete the road as quickly as possible.
