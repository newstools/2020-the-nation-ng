 A pan-African platform, Innovation Festival (IFest), was  launched on Tuesday in Lagos as an empowerment platform curated to harness talents that will advance the course of humanity and address the societal problems and challenges facing the continent in critical sectors. Its inaugural edition, which had: Exploring the possibilities of innovation as theme is powered by Maxxconnection, an experience marketing company. Speaking on the challenges plaguing Africa, at Radisson Blu, Ikeja, IFest Chairman, Prince Dapo Adelegan stated that, for long, the continent has been struggling with major societal issues ranging from insecurity, power, health unemployment, food scarcity etc. To get solutions to these issues, government institutions and corporate organisations have been taking steps in addressing these issues by orgainsing conferences, seminars, summits and meetings without a major action in proffering solutions. He said technology events, summits and hubs, have also been created in areas of IT and financial services, yet none of these have been able to address these challenges as technology remains just a driver. Prince Adelegan said: “IFest is an empowerment platform created to showcase and incubate African talents/ideas and to harness those talents to full potential while solving our societal issues. “Africans are talented and it is evident in the way and manner African youths have been able to advance the course in other western countries. Young talented Africans and Nigerians are all over without necessary support, exposure and capacity building to unbundle their hidden talent.” According to him, IFest as a platform will encourage and collate great innovative works from young Africans, especially in key areas that would assist to drive the continent out of poverty, and create jobs for millions  through the convergence of all stakeholders- government, venture capitalists, businesses and innovators.
