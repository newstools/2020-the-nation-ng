The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Football Association Chairman Mohammed Abba Mouktar has rewarded the FCT Football Team with Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Naira for qualifying for the football event of 2020 National Sports Festival from the North Central Zone in Ilorin, Kwara State. Mouktar while rewarding the players,  promised to surprise them in Benin, Edo State during the 20th Edition of National Sports Festival if they  defend  the men’s football gold medal gold won at  the 19th  National Sports Festival held in Abuja. “Apart from taking them to German for a playing tour, I will equally reward them financially on individual bases,” he said. “ I am more interested in developing and encouraging young players to grow; sending them to German for exposure will surely encourage them and motivate them to  focus more on reaching the top of their career. “ The Former Vice-Chairman of FCT  F.A, assured the players that on arrival from the festival they will have a Ministerial hand shake with FCT Minister Mohammed Bello if they retain the gold medal during the games in Edo.  He added “You all know that football is the  mother of all  sports and you must give your best to achieve the result. Don’t go for bronze or silver as they are not acceptable to FCTFA. Football is our industry in FCT. You must prove it.”
