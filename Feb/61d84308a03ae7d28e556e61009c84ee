Students of the Ambrose Alli University, Ekpoma on Friday staged a protest on the streets of Ekpoma, demanding prosecution of a policeman that slapped President of the Student Union Government, Comrade Osamagbe Eghobamien. The protesting students blocked the Benin-Auchi highway and sat in front of the Police Division in Ekpoma. A source said trouble started when some policemen attempted to arrest some students staying off campus. The source stated that some executives of the SUG were present at the scene and an attempt to intervene led to a policeman slapping Comrade Eghobamien. Spokesman for the institution, Mr. Edward Aihevba, said the police have apologised to the students. Aihevba said the campus was peaceful and no hitch in academic activities. He said the SUG executives have accepted the apology and traffic congestion has been eased.
