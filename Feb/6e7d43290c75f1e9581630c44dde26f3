Seventeen-year-old Blessing, a daughter to Mrs. Precious Okwuadigbo, who was shot and killed by a suspected naval officer in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State, has appealed to the police to unveil the identity of her mother’s killer. The shooting and killing of the victim occurred within the environment of Club 64, a popular night club located at Bay bridge, Yenagoa, the state capital. Though the naval officer was said to be at large, sources said he emerged from the club drunk and had altercation with some persons at the scene of the incident. A source, who spoke in confidence, said: “The shooter came out of the club drunk. He had misunderstanding with some persons. He pulled out his pistol and shot into the air twice. “He wanted to shoot the third time but the bullet strayed and hit the woman selling food at the area. She died before she could be taken to the hospital by sympathisers. The shooter ran away from the area”. The traumatised daughter said her late mother was the breadwinner of their family and wondered how they would survive without her. She described the way and manner her mother died as shocking and appealed to the police to investigate the incident and arrest persons behind it. She said: “I want to just appeal to the police, the Department of State Security (DSS) and every other person to help us. “We need to know the killer of our mother. We rely on the police and the DSS to tell us who killed our mother. They should fight for justice. They should find our mother’s killer and prosecute them”.
