The Special Committee on the Clean-up of Ikoyi and Victoria Island on Sundaysaid that it had impounded 215 vehicles, arrested and prosecuted 98 persons for various sundry environmental offences since the commencement of the exercise on January 10. This was made known in a statement signed by the  Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Tunji Bello, who also chairs the committee. Bello said the 215 vehicles were impounded from various areas in Ikoyi and Victoria Island for parking in prohibited zones and mechanic workshops located in unauthorised places. Those arrested included street traders who displayed their wares on walkways, road setbacks, those operating illegal car wash centers and automobile mechanics who converted public spaces to mechanic workshops as well as drivers of contravened vehicles who resisted the impoundment of the vehicles. The commissioner explained that those arrested were arraigned before mobile courts which sat at the Safety Arena Mobile court in Oshodi and another mobile court which sat in Victoria Island during one of the several raids and handed out sentences which included fines. He said that in terms of goods seized, those that are perishable were immediately dispatched to the various orphanages and motherless babies’ homes spread across the state by the Lagos State Environmental Sanitation Corps (LAGESC) while non-perishable items are being kept at the agency store at Oshodi pending when a decision will be taken The Chairman added that since the commencement of the exercise on January 10, the Special committee and its enforcement gangs have also been conducting daily raids across several streets to clear all shanties and structures on Drainage channels as well as occupants of abandoned buildings The enforcement gang is made up of operatives of the State Task Force on Environmental and Special offences, the Lagos Environmental Sanitation Corps (LAGESC), Lagos Neighbourhood Safety Corps and the Lagos State Waste Management Authority (LAWMA). He cautioned those managing liaison offices and other types of buildings, some of which have been abandoned, against serving as hiding places for Okada riders and street traders, many of whom usually seek refuge in them when raids were carried out. He also warned that if the practice continued, the committee would compile the list of such abandoned offices, publish it and may advice the state government to take legal measures to acquire such buildings.
