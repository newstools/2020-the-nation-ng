Former Golden Eaglets forward Otubanjo Yusuf is looking for a fresh start in Armenia after leaving LASK Linz. Armenian champions, FC Ararat-Armenia, signed the former Atletico Madrid starlet from the Austrian Bundesliga side last month. The 27-year-old joined LASK in July 2018 and played 33 games for the club, scoring six goals while providing seven assists. “I had little chances in the league last season and I have been waiting for new options from other teams,” Otubanjo told NationSport.” Thank God, Ararat-Armenia showed up and I decide to join then because they are one of the best in Armenia” Few seasons ago, Otubanjo made scoring headlines with FC Blau-Weiß Linz in Austrai where he remarkably scored 22 goals in 26 league appearances. Though   he has yet to produce such form due to spate of injuries in the intervening years, Otubanjo is upbeat that the good time is here again for him with the three- year old Yerevan-based side. “At least I will have playing time and get my game back together with my new team and we can take it from there” he added Otubanjo was a member of the Golden Eaglets squad that reached the final of the 2009 FIFA U17 World Cup held in Nigeria, playing as a substitute in two games against New Zealand in the second round and Switzerland in the Finals. After the tournament, he was snapped up by Atletico Madrid before spells at Red Bull Salzburg, FC Pasching, FC Blau-Weiß Linz, Zilina, SC Altach and LASK Linz.
