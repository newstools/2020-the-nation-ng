The National Oil Spillage and Response Agency, NOSDRA in partnership with stakeholders are working on grey areas in the amendment Bill that was turned down by President Muhammadu Buhari in 2018. President Muhammadu Buhari had in 2018 declined assent to the NOSDRA Establishment Act Amendment Bill. The Minister of State, Environment, Sharon Ikeazor, explained at a stakeholders workshop on NOSDRA amendment Bill held in Abuja, on Thursday, that the Agency had commenced the process for amendment of its establishment Act in 2011. She emphasised that assent was declined by Mr. President because of three observations cited on the Bill. Ikeazor said, the devastating impacts of oil spills on the environment, health and livelihoods of the rural and urban communities have led to land degradation, air and water pollution, loss of lives, destruction of habitats, loss of biodiversity, incidence of diseases, as well as the depletion of national revenue base. These illegal and inhuman practices must be stopped if we are to develop and progress as a nation. The Director General, NOSDRA, Idris Musa said it is noteworthy that the effort made so far until this point have been indeed tasking and engaging.
