 AHEAD of the rains, a team of Lagos State Government officials at the weekend inspected drainage clearance and dredging projects across the state. They promised to ensure a flood free Lagos. The team, led by the Special Adviser on Drainage and Water Resources, Joe Igbokwe and Permanent Secretary, Drainage Services, Lekan Shodeinde, visited canals and drainages under systems 6c, 5 and 4. The areas include LUTH/Itire/Daniyan in system 6c, Babs Animashaun in system 5, Alaka/Iponri/Tejuosho to Gbagada Bariga, Anthony Oke Alo and Apelehin Buxton Cole. Addressing reporters after the inspection, Igbokwe, an engineer, said in preparation for the rains, the government is paying attention to the clearing of drainage channels. He said that the tour became necessary to ascertain the level of work carried out by the contractors assigned to dredge and clear some of the canals, to reduce flood. Igbokwe assured residents that with the early clearing of major drainages, manholes and canals, when the rain starts, it will flow into its natural channels. He stressed that the ultimate goal of clearing and dredging of the drainage channels and canals was to allow easy passage of rainstorm water. The special adviser warned residents, who have erected fences that inhibit the passage way for movement of machinery that would affect clearing of silts at System 6c in Itire to remove them or have them demolished. He reiterated his appeals to those who have built on drainage alignments and setbacks to remove them or have them removed. Shodeinde, also an engineer, said it is regrettable that many of the channels that have been cleaned are being littered with refuse again by residents. He called for a change of heart, warning that the continued dumping of refuse in the canals and drains would affect the residents during the rainy season.
