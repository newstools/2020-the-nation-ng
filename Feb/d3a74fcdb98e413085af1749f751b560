Kwara State Government has begun enforcement of compliance on road setbacks in some parts of Ilorin, by ridding the state capital of illegal motor parks. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the enforcement was preceded by public enlightenment on the ills of illegal motor parks. Officials of the Kwara State Road Traffic Management Authority (KWARMA) have ridden the walkways and road setbacks around the popularly Post Office, Challenge, Ipata market and Central market, among others, of traders and hawkers. Those operating illegal motor, tricycle and motorcycle parks were also moved to the bus terminus built by the government at the old secretariat of the Kwara Council for Art and Court. KWARTMA officials were also seen enforcing evacuation of displayed goods on the pedestrian ways and under the overhead bridge at Post Office. A passerby, Mr. Taiwo Alabi, hailed the government for taking the necessary step to address the challenge.
