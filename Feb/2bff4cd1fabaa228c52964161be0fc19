Danish prosecutors on Monday called for a prison sentence of at least eight years for a woman charged with stealing millions from a Danish state welfare agency. According to prosecutors, Britta Nielsen, 65, cheated the National Board of Social Services and transferred at least 117 million kroner ( 17 million dollars) to her own accounts over a 25-year period. One of the two prosecutors, Kia Reumert, said that it was one of the most serious cases of financial crime that the country had experienced. Reumert urged the Copenhagen city court to consider a prison term of more than eight years for Nielsen, noting that over 300 transactions took place and that Nielsen had abused her position of trust at the social services agency. When the trial opened in October, Nielsen admitted to some of the crimes, but could not recall all the transactions covered in the charges which were from the period 1993 to 2018. The swindled agency supports local authorities and funds programmes for vulnerable groups including children and youth.
The scam was detected at the end of Sept. 2018, during an audit. However, some of the embezzled funds were used to buy property in South Africa and expensive cars. Nielsen was extradited to Denmark from South Africa in Nov. 2018. Nielsenâ€™s lawyer, Nima Nabipour, on Monday argued that only transactions from 2009 should be considered, citing the statute of limitations. Nabipour said Nielsen should at most be sentenced to four to six years in prison.
Sentencing was due on Feb. 18. (dpa/NAN)
