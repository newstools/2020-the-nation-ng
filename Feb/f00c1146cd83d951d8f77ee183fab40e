 FORMER Captain of Super Eagles Joseph Yobo has said that his appointment as assistant coach of the senior national male team is to add value and be involved in the building confidence in the young squad. Yobo, who disclosed this in a chat, said he acknowledged the good work of Gernot Rohr has done with the young team by refocusing and building confidence in the players. He said the team’s outing in major competitions and qualifiers have been wonderful and only needed á little push to get to the top. “I have been there before though as a player but now as a coach which is entirely a different thing. I hope to learn because my mission is to add value to the team.  The current team is fantastic and full of energy. With just a little push the team will be Africa Champion. Every player and coach wants to win the Nations Cup. “I have won it as a player and I want to win it as a coach. Also you know that at this stage it is about managing the players not teaching them the rudiments of the game. I believe that the Eagles can win the next Nations Cup if properly guided and we hope to guide them right. “Also since my appointment many of them have called to congratulate me and have been talking on how to move the team forward as one united family.  Musa and I have been talking too. The former Everton defender thanked the leadership of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) especially the President Amaju Pinnick and the entire board for finding him worthy to serve in the senior team as an assistant coach. “You know whatever we do in life, God first. I give glory to God and millions of football fans who congratulated me and I pray that God will be us to achieve the desired results in all our competitions”. Yobo added.
