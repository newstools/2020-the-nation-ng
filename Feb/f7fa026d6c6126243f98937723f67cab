 The Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) Boss Mustapha on Tuesday criticised those calling for the sack of Service Chiefs. Mustapha declared the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari will not sack the Service Chiefs now. He said there are processes that must be followed to effect their sack. According to him: “We are in a very difficult time now. We need everybody to be on board. We need synergy within intelligent community, within the military formations that will help fight this war. “We are in a very difficult situation and when we begin to create cracks and divisions, who will be the beneficiaries? “The adversaries are the ones that are going to exploit those deficiencies and further the cause of destabilising the nation”. He spoke with reporters in Abuja after a book presentation titled CAN, Religion, politics and power in Nigeria by former General Secretary of Christian Association of Nigeria(CAN) Engr Samuel Salifu. The SGF said what government needs is for: “At this moment, what we need is for everybody to be on the same page, fight the battle of securing the nation for protecting lives and property and ensuring that every Nigerian has the opportunity to live a prosperous live. I think that should be our main focus”. He added: “You don’t sack people like that. There are processes and I believe that at the opportune time, those processes will be followed. You don’t just wake up and say sack people, it doesn’t happen like that”. Details shortly…
