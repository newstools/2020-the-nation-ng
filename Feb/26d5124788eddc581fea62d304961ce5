 The House of Representatives on Wednesday summoned the immediate past Postmaster-General of the Federation, Bisi Adegbuyi and the past and present management of the Nigeria Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC). They are to explain why they failed to render accounts for the funds their agencies generated from 2014 till date. The House Committee on Public Accounts took the decision when both agencies appeared at a public hearing on refusal of non-treasury funded and partially-funded agencies to render their audited accounts covering 2014 till date to the Auditor-General of the Federation, as required by law. The Postmaster-General, Dr Ismail Adebayo Adewusi, had told the committee that he just assumed office and was making efforts to get the audited accounts ready for submission. But the committee was not pleased with the excuse. It said Adewusi’s predecessor should be summoned to account for his stewardship. The committee’s Chairman Oluwole Oke said: “This is strange. This is not a private entity but a public one in which several billions of naira are being budgeted for every year. I think the former Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST) boss must appear before this committee to account for his stewardship.
