The House of Representatives has unanimously moved for the creation of the Southwest Development Commission. The lawmakers said the proposed commission became necessary in view of the region’s strategic importance to the nation’s overall socio-economic development. The Bill for the establishment of the commission was sponsored by about 80 lawmakers from the six geographical zones of the country. It scaled the second reading in the House and was referred to the Committee on Judiciary for further legislative action. Sponsors of the Bill include Abdulrazaq Namdas, Nkiruka Onyejeocha, Sada Soli, Nduyok Francis Charles, Kabir Alhassan Rurum, Victor Nwokolo, Nzoma, Nkem Abonta, Bashiru Dawodu, James Faleke. Lead sponsor Olufemi Fakeye said due to the slave trade that took place in its coastal areas of West Africa centuries ago, the Southwest was exposed early to and embraced Western education. According to him, it was natural that the region’s government would be the first to develop and implement a free primary school education policy in the mid-1950s, even before the country attained Independence in 1960. Tahir Mongunu urged other members to support the Bill, saying when the North East Development Commission Bill was brought before the House, it was passed without any opposition. Onyejeocha said the Bill was a wake-up call for the legislature. Yusuf Buba described Lagos as the Commercial Capital of Nigeria, which does not belong to anybody but all Nigerians. Ossai Nicholas Ossai said Lagos and the Southwest have the biggest sea port in the country with a lot of pressure on facilities in the area. Other contributors to the Bill stressed the need to pass it into law. Henry Nwawuba said beyond ensuring the Bill’s passage, the House should also ensure that the President quickly signs it into law.
