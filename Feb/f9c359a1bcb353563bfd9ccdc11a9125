Sanni Onogu, Abuja  All the highways in and around the Federal Secretariat in Abuja have been cordoned off by soldiers and policemen. The action has led to a massive build up of traffic as motorists have been prevented from movement. This has caused a huge spillover of traffic to adjoining roads in the Central Business District of Abuja. It was learnt that the roads were sealed off because of the launching of an AirBus by the Air Force at the Eagle Square.
