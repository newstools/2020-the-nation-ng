The wife of the prisoner, it was gathered, was said to have harboured the suspects in her house when the police raided the place and arrested the suspects. It was gathered that the monarch’s wife was kidnapped before her husband and other domestic staff on Sunday, January 26, 2020, barely one month after she and her husband celebrated their 50 years wedding anniversary. Prince Paul Okoro, younger brother to HRH Eze Dr. Emmanuel Okoro Oha 1 of Ihitoha Uratta, who confirmed the incident described it as sad, saying the death came after the family had paid the ransom demanded by the kidnappers. He said before the woman was taken away, there were sporadic shootings, which left the woman panicking before she was moved away.
