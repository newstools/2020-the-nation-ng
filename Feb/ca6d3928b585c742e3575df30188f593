Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on School Feeding Programme, Dr. Dotun Adebayo, has reiterated the Federal Government’s commitment to the home grown school feeding programme. He said this during the distribution of plates and spoons to public primary school pupils in Lagos State at the St. Agnes Primary School Hall, Maryland Ikeja, last week. Primary 1-3 pupils will benefit from the initiative of the Federal Government in collaboration with the Lagos State Universal Basic Board (LASUBEB). Adebayo said the distribution became necessary after it was discovered that some pupils do not come to school with their plates. “In order to avoid an unhygienic presentation of the meals, we took a step further to make sure that every child has a decent plate to eat,” he said. In his address, the Executive Chairman of LASUBEB, Wahab Alawiye-King, praised the Federal Government for the laudable initiative, which he said would increase enrolment, improve nutrition, and enhance learning. “With the commencement of the home grown programme, malnutrition will be greatly reduced and enrolment in primary school will increase,” he said. The Chairman expressed his delight in the distribution of plates and spoons, while urging the food vendors to ensure that the plates are kept clean at all times and used solely for the pupils.
