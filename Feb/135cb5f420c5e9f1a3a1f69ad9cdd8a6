Chibok Local Government Area of Borno State on Tuesday came under heavy attack by the Boko Haram terrorists, who stormed Korongilum Community in a heavy convoy of gun trucks and motorcycles. The heavily armed insurgents stormed the community around 6pm when the villagers were returning from the dayâ€™s work and opened fire on the hapless residents, killing scores and wounding many others in the process. Many houses were also razed by the rampaging terrorists who operated for hours unchallenged. Meanwhile efforts to get the Army Spokesperson, Colonel Sagir Musa, to confirm the attack on the community, were abortive as he did not respond to the several calls by our Correspondent. The spokesperson of Operation Lafiya Dole, Colonel Isa Ado could not also take his calls as at the time of filling this report. According to the report, the insurgents came into the community around 6pm, shooting sporadically and setting many houses on fire. But a reliable source within the Military hierarchy, said that the military is on top of the situation and has restored normalcy in the community.
