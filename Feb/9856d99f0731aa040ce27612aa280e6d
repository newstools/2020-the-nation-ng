Although it’s has been five years since noted businessman Chief Molade Okoya-Thomas passed on, he is still fresh in the minds of family and friends. A colourful remembrance ceremony event was held recently at Oriental Hotel, Victoria Island, Lagos, and it was attended by top personalities, including First Lady of Ogun State, Mrs. Bamidele Abiodun, Segun Awolowo, Hajia Abbah Folawiyo, Senator Daisy Danjuma, Senator Florence Ita-Giwa, Dame Abimbola Fashola, Abike Dabiri-Erewa and Oba Saheed Elegushi. While Okoya-Thomas’ daughter, former Rep Jumoke, gave a short welcome address, his son, Deji, handled the vote of thanks. The major highlights of the event were Bible reading, tributes, special renditions, exhortations and prayers.
