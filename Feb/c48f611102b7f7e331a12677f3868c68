All pupils in public primary schools at Apapa-Iganmu Local Council Development Area (LCDA) in Lagos State have received free school bags. Three hundred indigent secondary school leavers also got free JAMB forms. The Chairman of Apapa-Iganmu LCDA, Dr. Funmilayo Akande-Mohammed, who gave out the materials, said they would complement the council’s effort in improving the standard of education. Akande-Mohammed added that the gesture would assist parents in giving their children a quality education. “Today, we are fulfilling part of our promises to increase the number of literates in our council. We are determined to see the youth excelling in their studies. “I want to implore parents, on their own part, to rise up to the challenges of monitoring, supporting and encouraging their children to study hard and be of good character,” she said. She said the beneficiaries of the free JAMB forms will be enrolled for special tutorials. “It has become a yearly tradition for us to reduce illiteracy and embrace literacy by presenting JAMB  forms to assist and motivate our students to study and achieve their goals,” she said. The council boss said she would soon disburse bursary to students in tertiary institutions. “I want to implore the students and parents to take advantage of this gesture and always support our party, the All Progressives Congress (APC),” she said. The students, she said, should utilise the golden opportunity to study hard and proceed to higher institutions of their choices.
