Our Reporter Horoya’s Nigerian striker, Bolaji Simeon Sakin, has predicted a win for his Guinean side when they meet Enyimba in the CAF Confederation Cup quarter final first leg tie in Aba. Horoya FC remains unbeaten in the last eight matches from the playoffs to the group stage after they dropped from the CAF Champions League to Africa’s second tier club competition. They further showed their determination with a remarkable 14 points out of 18 to top their Group B section. Sakin said that he respects Enyimba but do not fear them because his team actually prayed to be drawn against Nigerian side as against the North Africans. “I can say that the game with Enyimba will enable me come to Nigeria again after some time that I last visited,” Sakin said in an interview. “I was actually praying that we were drawn with Enyimba because it won’t be too difficult dealing with them as against playing against the North Africans at this stage. “We have a lot of respect for Enyimba; I have played against them too while with Abia Warriors and Rivers United but we do not fear them. “We are hoping to play the game of our lives in the first leg and probably have most of the job done so that we will play with ease before our fans in the second leg,” he added. Enyimba who finished second in Group D behind Hassania Agadir of Morocco will host Horoya first on March 1 before the return leg in Conakry on March 8.
