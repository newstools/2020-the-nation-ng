From Sam Ibok, AKSCOE Acting Provost, Akwa Ibom State College of Education (AKSCOE), Afaha Nsit, Dr. Daniel Udo, has inaugurated a security structure in the institution. The structure is made up of well- experienced security personnel to address insecurity threateninng the peace of the college. Speaking at the kick-off, Udo assured his administration would ensure evils have no foothold in the college. This, he explained, triggered the institution’s partnership with a viable security outfit in the fight against insecurity. On the latest security development in the institution, he said, “The security frame is meant to provide security for staff and students and the entire community. He added: “Of late, we’ve been having issues of insecurity ranging from burglary, cultism, phone snatching. No responsible parent would want to send his/her ward to a place that is insecure; that is why we are taking security headlong. “We are doing everything to ensure that whosoever is having  legitimate duty, carries it out without fear of being harrassed or molested. So, the security frame is to  buttress the point that we have taken responsibility to ensure maximum security in the college.” Udo assured both staff and students of the college continued protection of lives and properties. He added that aside security, management would also prioritise their welfare. On his part, the manager of the security outfit, Elder George Okon, thanked the management for the partnership. “We have trained them (personnel) in combat and in many other ways. The same training we give to them here is the same we give to the police, SSS (State Security Service) even Civil Defence. With this team on ground, the school will experience a great change in security.” Highpoint of the event was inspection of parade by the Provost.
