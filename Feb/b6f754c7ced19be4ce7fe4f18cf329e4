THE Ewutuntun Grammar School Old Students’ Association has donated 100 units of desks and benches to Ewutuntun Junior Grammar School, Mafoluku, Oshodi, Lagos state. Making the presentation to the parents, staff and students of the school was Mr. Adekunle Jaiyesimi, the President of the association, who advised the students to make good use of the furniture in order to encourage the association to be more committed to the development of the school. He said: “We were here last year September to make our humble donation to the Senior Section of the school. Then, we promised to do what we are doing today. I am happy that we have fulfilled our promise.” Mr Jaiyesimi appealed to the students to behave morally and face their studies squarely in order to be good ambassadors of their school, families and communities. He expressed the gratitude of the association to Alhaji Wasiu Balogun, a prominent old student, for contributing largely to the advancement of the school in different aspects of life. Alhaji Balogun told the students to keep away from vices and embrace virtues, so that they would grow up to become responsible, intelligent and successful adults. He called on parents to support the government in taking care of the school because “the government alone cannot do everything.” Hon Femi Mustapha, who commissioned the furniture on behalf of the Chairman of the Oshodi Local Government, Alhaji Muse Ariyoh, advised the school to approach the local government for help on projects that would add value to the school. Mr. Femi Adenola, representing the Parent-Teacher Association, thanked the old students for the presentation and appealed for their help on other urgent needs of the school. The Principal of the school, Mrs B. M. Abiiba, who expressed her happiness at the presentation, thanked all members of the association and prayed for them for remembering their alma mater.
