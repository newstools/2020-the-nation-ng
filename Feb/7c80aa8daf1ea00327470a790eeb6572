 HOODLUMS have burnt the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) offices in Orlu, Imo State and in Idemili North, Anambra State. The Orlu incident followed the declaration of the Peoples Democratic Party candidate, Jerry Alagboso, as the winner of the re-run Orlu/Orsu/Oru East Federal Constituency election. The fire, which razed the secretariat, began in the early hours of yesterday and continued until 6.30 am. The supplementary election was fraught with violence following the invasion of the collation centre by hoodlums. They stopped the collation process and tore result sheets. INEC completed the collation three days later at its state office in Owerri, the state capital, and declared Alagbaoso as the winner. It was learnt that the inferno destroyed INEC’s sensitive documents but no life was lost. No firefighter was seen at the scene, a resident told our correspondent. Police spokesman Orlando Ikeokwu said the Commissioner of Police, Olaniyi Fafowora, had ordered an investigation. “I can confirm the incident to you but the cause of the fire outbreak is unknown for now. “The Commissioner of Police has dispatched operatives to the scene.”
