 The Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) has postponed its local government congresses scheduled for Saturday, February 8. It held its ward congresses last week but some members led by Hon Sylvanus Eruaga kicked against the processes and secured a restraining order from an Edo State high court. The court presided over by Justice Joy Okeaya-Inneh granted the prayers of the PDP members and barred the party from conducting today’s local government congresses. Edo Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Mr. Chris Nehikhare, who announced the postponement in a statement said the party was embarrassed and disappointed by those behind the court processes. Nehikhare said the PDP members failed to exhaust the internal conflict resolution mechanism of the party before resorting to taking legal action. He stated that the National Working Committee of the PDP has constituted a Congress Appeal Panel to resolve all disputes arising from the Ward congresses. Nehikhare said the ward congresses was planned, organized and executed from Abuja saying members of the state working committee were not party to the process. According to him: “It is pertinent to note that some of the Governorship aspirants who had earlier praised the conduct of the ward congress have started singing a new song. They are now condemning the process, conduct and even results of an exercise they earlier adjudged free, fair, transparent and credible. “It is important to state here that the sale of forms to all the positions were sold to interested party members at the Party Headquarters in Abuja. It is therefore disingenuous and mischievous for someone to sit down in his ” hell conditioned” room, formulate a list in an attempt to breed contempt and incite. “As a law abiding party, we will obey the court order when duly served. “Consequently, the LGA congresses scheduled for Saturday, 8th February is postponed.”
