Workers of Ifako-Ijaiye Local Government have praised the Acting Chairman, Usman Akanbi Hamzat, for approving the payment of Christmas bonus and prompt payment of their increased welfare package. The Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE) Chairman in the local government, Comrade Kayode David, who spoke at the maiden thanksgiving service and prayer session organised by the acting chairman, noted that Ifako-Ijaiye was the first local government to pay workers 13th month salary and enhance their welfare packages.

He commended the workers and management of the council for their commitment to the objective of the administration. Hamzat tagged 2020 ‘Year of Progress’ for Ifako-Ijaiye residents, adding that the local government would consolidate on the previous achievements.
