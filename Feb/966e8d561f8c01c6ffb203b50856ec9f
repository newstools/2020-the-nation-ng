Operatives of the Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences Unit on Wednesday arrested two men for impersonating security officers at Oshodi, Lagos. Chairman of the agency, Olayinka Egbeyemi, a chief superintendent of police, said that while one of the suspects, Monday Job impersonated a police officer using his commercial motorcycle to scout for passengers on restricted routes, the second, Rasak Oloyede, presented himself as an army officer using his commercial bus for fraudulent acts along Lagos-Abeokuta Expressway. Egbeyemi stated that after their arrest the two suspects confessed to the crime, saying that they indulged in the act in order not to be accosted by security officers on patrol. He said, “Our intelligence reports revealed that some dubious-minded motorcyclists are now using fake Nigerian Army/Police uniforms to scout for passengers on restricted routes as well as indulging in various forms of fraudulent acts across the state”. He reiterated the directive of the state government which stipulates that all security personnel on official assignment with motorcycles must be fully kitted in uniform with their identity card conspicuously displayed. The chairman also reiterated that motorcycle operators must desist from plying all 475 restricted routes, adding that they must wear their crash helmets and must possess riders permits for proper identification of the park they belong while plying other routes. One of the suspects, Monday Job, said he bought the uniform from a police officer who was deployed from Lagos to the northern part of the country for N7000, adding that he has since been using the uniform to carry out illegal arrest and extorting money from both motorists and motorcyclists plying restricted routes along Lagos-Abeokuta expressway. “I was hawking before I joined Okada business over a year ago and I have been wearing this police uniform to arrest and defraud Okada riders and making at least N30.000 to N35.000 daily,” he added. The second suspect, Rasak Oloyede, who impersonated a sergeant in the Nigerian Army, said he had been using the uniform he got from a dismissed Army officer to escape check.
