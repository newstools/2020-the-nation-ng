Shareholders of AXA Mansard Insurance Plc has approved a divestment plan that involves sale of the insurance company’s real estate investments and pension management subsidiary. At the extraordinary general meeting in Lagos, shareholders unanimously mandated the board to divest from AXA Mansard Pensions Limited, the group’s pension management subsidiary. Shareholders also authorised the directors to divest from real estate investment, without necessarily outlining the specific real estate assets. The meeting authorised the directors to appoint such advisers, professionals and parties that they deem necessary, upon such terms and conditions that the directors may deem appropriate with regard to the sale of the subsidiary and real estate assets. According to shareholders, the board of directors is “authorised to take all steps and do all acts that they deem necessary for the successful implementation” of the above resolutions on sale of AXA Mansard Pension and real estate assets. Insurance companies are in a hot race to raise new equity capital to meet new minimum capital requirements for various insurance functions as directed by the National Insurance Commission (NAICOM). NAICOM had in May 2019 released new capital requirements for insurance businesses with a 13-month compliance period for operators to shore up their minimum capital base to the required level. The minimum paid-up share capital of a life insurance company was increased from N2 billion to N8 billion, non-life insurance from N3 billion to N10 billion, composite insurance from N5 billion to N18 billion while re-insurance companies were directed to raise their capital base from N10 billion to N20 billion. Most analysts agreed that the recapitalisation would open up opportunities for mergers and acquisitions, putting the top insurance companies with large capital base in good stead to acquire other companies and build up their base.
