 THE Ekiti State government has raised the alarm over the high rate of defilement of public secondary school students across the state by their teachers. The Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Olawale Fapohunda said the ministry of Justice and the police command were investigating the allegations of sexual violence in state-owned public schools. He spoke in Ado-Ekiti, the state capital, at the weekend during a meeting with the state executive council of the Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT). Fapohunda said preliminary investigations by his office revealed that some members of the NUT in at least three secondary schools were indulging in the heinous act. He pointed out that the establishment of the sex offenders register in the state raised awareness among the population and helped victims to report any cases of sexual violence to the ministry. He further said that the preponderance of allegations of defilement in schools compelled his office to formally advise the police and other security agencies on the need for a thorough investigation of the matter. The Attorney-General stressed that the state government had zero tolerance for sexual offences. He said the government will do everything possible to prevent the state from being tagged a thriving land for violence against women and the girl-child. “Majority of teachers in the state are hard-working, many working diligently under difficult conditions to ensure that their students excel. It is therefore important that the NUT take immediate and urgent action to identify the very few who are bringing the name of the union into disrepute,” he said. In his response, the NUT chairman, Samuel Olugbesan, who frowned at the alarming cases of sexual violence perpetrated by teachers, reiterated the Union’s commitment to eradicating sexual violence in schools. He noted the union will take urgent measures in responding to the situation, stressing that any teachers found culpable will face the full wrath of the law.
