If you think all Executive Director of RevolutionPlus Property, Tolulope Onalaja, knows how to do best is work, it is a huge mistake. She loves dancing and she is quite good at it. At her 40th birthday celebration on February 14, she didn’t just dance for long hours; she demonstrated a good understanding of the popular Nigerian dance steps. It was as if she and her husband, Bamidele Onalaja, Managing Director, RevolutionPlus Property, rehearsed the dance steps before the D-day. They danced to music from Naira Marley, Burna Boy, Zlatan Ibile, Teni, among others. The all-white party held at Landmark Event Centre, Victoria Island, Lagos, was attended by Ayo Makun, Adekola Odunlade, Teni and other society personalities. Dressed in a sparkling white gown with beautiful accessories, she became the cynosure of all eyes the moment she stepped into the hall. Colleagues and family members also used the opportunity to speak on Onalaja’s kindness and care for people around her as well as society at large.
