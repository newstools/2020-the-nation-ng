From Nwanosike Onu, Awka  Ahead of the 2021 governorship election in Anambra State, one of the aspirants on the platform of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr Godwin Ezeemo, says the only way the party will get it right is by conducting a transparent primary. Ezeemo made the observation in Awka, the Anambra State capital, after donating 15,300 membership cards to the state secretariat of the party, to help his party members. Speaking with reporters at the venue, after handing them to the PDP Chairman Sir Ndubuisi Nwobu, Ezeemo said the membership cards would stop them from the stress of securing more cards. The PDP chieftain said Nwobu had already assured all the aspirants of free, fair and transparent primary and that he was he hopes to get the party’s ticket for the election. He said whatever problem the PDP is going through is an internal affair. He added that it happens everywhere and that it would eventually be sorted out.  Ezeemo added: “Power belongs to God, but we are hopeful of winning the 2021 election in Anambra State and the major thing is for us to get it right during our primary. Party is a family; I didn’t buy the cards because I’m aspiring for any position. It is my own little way of helping our members. Other people can equally donate; I’m a party man. I did the same when I was in the ACN too. “I’m working with my team in making sure the ticket comes to me. Power belongs to the people and they are the ones to decide. But, what makes me better than others is that I’m not a diaspora aspirant, rather a local man who has endeared himself to the grassroots. “What the aspirants need from the party during the primary is transparency which the chairman has already assured.” However, he gave kudos to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for deregistering many political parties in the country. He said it was one of the good things the electoral body has got right.
