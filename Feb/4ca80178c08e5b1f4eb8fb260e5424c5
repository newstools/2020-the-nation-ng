 With the confirmed case of Coronavirus in Lagos State, the Kano State Government has mapped out strategies to ensure that the deadly virus does not find its way into the state. The Nation gathered that the state governor, Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, upon getting wind of the case in Lagos, summoned an emergency meeting consisting of stakeholders in the health sector at the Government House to deliberate on the best way to protect Kano residents from the dreaded disease. A source close to the governor told our reporter that the governor is leaving no stone unturned over the development. The source who asked not to be named because he is not the governor’s spokesperson, said: “You are aware that Kano is a cosmopolitan state. It is also a commercial city people from different parts of the world enter on a daily basis. “So, I can tell you that Governor Ganduje is worried. He has held series of meetings to ensure and assure the people that everything is under control. “In fact, as I speak to you, the Commissioner of Health is planning a press conference designed to sensitise the people on the symptoms and inherent danger associated with the virus.”
