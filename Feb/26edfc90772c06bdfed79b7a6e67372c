The excitement at the National Secretariat of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) over alleged protest during President Muhammadu Buhariâ€™s condolence visit to Borno State was nasty. It confirmed speculations that the party and its leaders/ members are ready to cling to any straw to bounce back to power in 2023. A few minutes after the slight protest under a pedestrian bridge, PDP members started tweeting the video in thousands amid celebration of likely electoral fortunes at the next poll. But the analysis of the tape showed that the protest was restricted to the same spot contrary to the impression created that most residents shunned and stunned Buhari. The findings of security agencies may reveal more than meets the eye.
