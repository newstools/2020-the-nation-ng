Lagos State Government has advocated an education system that provides a strong foundation that will prepare students for the future. Secretary to the State Government (SSG) Mrs. Folashade Jaji gave the advice at the opening ceremony of a two-day Southwest Education Summit organised by the Development Agenda for Western Nigeria Commission and United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DFID), at Continental Hotel, Victoria Island, Lagos. Mrs. Jaji, the chief host, said education raises people’s productivity and creativity in addition to promoting businesses and technological improvements. She said today’s education system must be fashioned out to give students tools that would make them effective in whatever they chose to do. Highlighting the Lagos State commitment to sound education, Mrs. Jaji said that the government kick started the revolution of getting the expected learning outcomes from the students by making education and technology the third and fundamental pillar of the T.H.E.M.E.S development agenda to deliver a greater Lagos. She said: “Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has also doubled the budgetary allocation on education to boost the state’s human  capital and rehabilitate public schools statewide.”
