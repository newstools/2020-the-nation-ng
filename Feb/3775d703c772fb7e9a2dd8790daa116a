Leaders of the Oyo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) across the three senatorial districts yesterday expressed confidence in the leadership quality of the former National Interim Chairman of the party, Chief Bisi Akande, who has been appointed to head the party’s national reconciliation panel. The party leaders also reaffirmed their support for the National Leader of the party, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and the National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole. They urged them to continue to allow justice and fairness to guide their decisions for the good of the party. The APC had dropped the Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, from its National Reconciliation Committee and appointed the former National Interim Chairman, Chief Akande, to head the reconstituted 12-man committee. Excited by the development, the APC leaders, after rising from their meeting in Ibadan yesterday, thanked the National Leader, Asiwaju Tinubu and National Chairman, Comrade  Oshiomhole for responding to the request of members of the party. A former state party secretary and senatorial chairman, Hon. Lasun Odebunmi, while addressing reporters in Ibadan after their meeting, implored the new reconciliation committee to pay attention to members’ grievances in Oyo State by allowing the stakeholders to express their grievances with a view to bringing lasting peace to the party. Speaking about the controversy that trailed the alleged nomination of former governor Abiola Ajimobi as the National Deputy Chairman (South), Odebunmi, who served as House of Assembly member during the administration of Chief Kolapo Ishola, said that the stakeholders were not concerned about the Osogbo meeting, but the failure of the leaders to consult the state elders before the nomination. He said the national leaders of the party are highly respected by stakeholders in the state, adding that in making the nomination, they should have carried the stakeholders along because the nominee is there to represent the people of the state.
