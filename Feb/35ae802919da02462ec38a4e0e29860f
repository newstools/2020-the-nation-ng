Capital market experts are scheduled to meet on Thursday to brainstorm on the Federal Government’s 2020 budget and its implications for the capital market. At the fourth Budget Seminar Series being organised by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), experts will brainstorm on the theme, “Leveraging the 2020 Budget and Finance Act for the Growth of the Nigerian Capital Market”. In a statement, the Commission stated that the seminar series has been established as a forum for evaluating the connection between the Nigerian capital market and the annual Federal Government’s budget. According to SEC, a major aim of the seminar series is to identify how the capital market can contribute to and in turn benefit from the budget and its implementation. Experts with insightful knowledge and experience on various economic activities will deliberate extensively, with the aim of enlightening participants on the area of focus for the seminar. Experts will discuss the budget within the context of the overall national economic growth plan and domestic investors’ base. Nigeria’s Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP), launched by President Muhammadu Buhari, plans to improve Gross National Savings (GNS) steadily to 15.53 per cent, 18.19 per cent and 21.31 per cent in 2018, 2019 and 2020.
