 THE Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG) has hosted a panel session at the 2020 social media week in continuation of its ‘Nigeria 2050: Shifting Gears’ discussion, which focused on the policy framework that can help transform Nigeria into a modern and globally competitive economy by 2050. The discussions focused on human capital productivity, sustainable peace and security, managing demography and rapid industrialisation. Head of Corporate Communications and moderator of the session, Yinka Iyinolakan, said for Nigeria to become an economically viable and globally competitive country, there is a need for Nigerians of all ages to partner and get involved in the discussions surrounding the country’s development. Senior Economist at the NESG Wilson Erumebor, who hinted that Nigeria’s population is projected to be 401 million by 2050, stressed it will affect infrastructure, social amenities, education, health and food security. He mentioned the three scenarios that the NESG projected for Nigeria in 2050 – as Nigeria rises, Nigeria stagnates and Nigeria fails. He said much work needs to be done to ensure the best-case scenario for Nigeria. Founder of Flying Doctors Nigeria Dr. Ola Brown said if Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is shared among all Nigerians, each will get about N30,000 in comparison to the United States of America (U.S.) where each citizen will get about US$60,000. She opined that for Nigeria to develop, there was need to increase investments and exports.
