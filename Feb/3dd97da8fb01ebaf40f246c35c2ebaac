The Certificates of Occupancy of some choice properties belonging to Governor Godwin Obaseki, former Deputy Governor, Dr. Pius Odubu, the member representing Owan Federal Constituency, Prof. Julius Ihonvbere have been revoked. The properties are located in the Government Reservation Area. Others whose propertìes the C of O were also revoked are Chief Oseni Elamah, Mr. Oghogho Akpata, Susan Itemuagbor, Aigboje Ehidero, AIG Imuokhuede and Noggie Megisson. Affected corporate bodies in the revocation are CA Aliyu and Company Limited, Bimseg Venture Limited and Sharon Properties. A document sighted by our reporter showed that the properties were revoked because they are required for the services of the Government of Edo State. Prof. Ihonvbere said he has completed the building he is erecting on his plot. A top government official, who confirmed the revocation, said the Governor was also affected. The source said more lands within the GRA would be revoked because all government lands and accommodation have been allocated to individuals. According to the source: “You can see Governor Obaseki has built quarters for judges but it is not enough and there is the need for more land to build more quarters for the judges. “Individuals and politicians just allocated government lands to themselves so the Governor decided to revoke his own and others. More land will be revoked.” Odubu said he only read about the revocation on the social media as there was no newspaper publications yet. Odubu said would wait for the Governor to carry out the revocation before commenting.
