  THE Alake and Paramount Ruler of Egbaland, Oba Adedotun Gbadebo, has disclosed that the Egba people in Ogun State have concluded plans to construct N600million Abeokuta City Hall in memory of late Lisabi Agbongbo-Akala,  the liberator of Egbaland, who died mysteriously over ten decades ago. Gbadebo made this known at a press conference  in preparatory for  the 34th Lisabi Festival with the theme, Culture: A Panacea for Sustainable Socio-Economic Development of Egbaland. This year edition of Lisabi Festival is slated for February 24 through to March 1. The monarch, who affirmed that the family house of the late Egba warrior is located in Igbein area of Abeokuta, declared that the history of Egbaland is incomplete without reference to the late warrior who he said liberated the Egbas from series of wars launched against them by the Old Oyo. The traditional ruler also expressed satisfaction with the erection of 18 feet statue of Lisabi at Adatan roundabout, designated as Lisabi Avenue in the town. The Alake said on completion of the N600m hall, it will accommodate 3,500 seats adding that the over 100 years Centenary Hall would soon be turned to a tourist centre, hence, the need for the proposed Abeokuta City Hall, which will be located on 7 hectares of land in Ewang Estate axis of the town, disclosing that the foundation laying ceremony comes up on Saturday. “Those who initiated the construction of the Centenary Hall over 100 years ago are gone, so we should let our impact known, and therefore all Egbas both at home and in diaspora have concluded that a multi-million naira Abeokuta City Hall will be put in place,” Gbadebo said. The Alake commended his subjects resident abroad for their regular support towards developmental growth of the land, and still on the forthcoming Lisabi Festival, disclosing that about 10,000 members of the Odua Peoples’ Congress, (OPC), are to participate. The monarch said there would be exhibition, cultural display, booming of guns, debate, indoor games competitions, concert and hero award among others during the festival.
