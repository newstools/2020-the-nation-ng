The pioneer old students of the Ekiti State Government College, Oye-Ekiti in Oye local government area have donated a building for tuck shop as a way of giving back to their Alma Mater. The school, formerly Unity Secondary, was established in 1985 and graduated its first set of 55 students in 1991. Speaking during the official commissioning of the project, the coordinator of the alumni body, Mr. Niyi Osinkolu, noted that the school contributed immensely to their careers, which informed the gesture. He said that the multi-million naira building would further add value to the school where teachers and pupils would have the opportunity to buy all needed products and materials within the school premises. He added that government alone must not be left alone in the area of helping to public schools in the state, saying all stakeholders must be ready to contribute their quotas in completing government’s efforts in the area of education. According to him: ” We will continue to give back to this school because we all pass through here years ago and we are proud of this. We are the first set and it is necessary for us to set the pace for other old students to follow suit and come back to assist the school.” Osinkolu called on Governor Kayode Fayemi to ensure more teachers are recruited into primary and secondary schools across in the interest of the students. The school Principal, Mrs. Modupe Adelabu, commended the pioneer alumni for the gesture , advising other old students to look back and contribute to the uplifting of the school. She assured the alumni body that the school would make judicious use of the building.
