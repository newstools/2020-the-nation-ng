Our Reporter Super Eagles wonderkid Samuel Chukwueze will make his 50th La Liga appearance for Villareal if he takes part in their crunch away game against Atletico Madrid at the Wanda Metropolitano Stadium tomorrow. Chukwueze has scored eight goals and five assists in 49 games since he made his debut for the Yellow Submarine in a 1-1 draw with Levante on November 4, 2018. Chukwueze joined Villarreal youth setup in 2017, from local side Diamond Academy. After being initially assigned to the club’s Juvenil A squad, he made his senior debut with the reserves on April 15, 2018, coming on as a second-half substitute for Sergio Lozano in a 1-1 Segunda División B away draw against CE Sabadell FC. Chukwueze made his first-team debut on September 20, 2018 in a 2–2 UEFA Europa League home draw against Scottish giants Rangers, coming in for Nicola Sansone in the 79th minute. The 20-year-old was in action for 14 minutes after replacing Paco Alcacer in Villarreal’s 2-1 win over Levante in last Saturday’s La Liga tie. So far in the 2019/20 season, he has played 23 times for the Valencia-based side, finding the back of the net three times and making three assists.
