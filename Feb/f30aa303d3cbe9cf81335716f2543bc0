A 30-year-old man was on Sunday caught with what is suspected to be an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) at the Sabon Tasha branch of the Living Faith Church, (aka Winners) Chapel in Kaduna. It was learnt it was not the first time the suspect was coming to the church, having been sent away just last week. The Chief Security Officer of the parish stated that the suspect was monitored on a CCTV Camera carrying the bag into the church auditorium. According to him, the suspect successfully gained access and was already seated before his bag was searched and the explosive device was found. Edet, who said he was not in a position to hand out details to the press, appealed to our correspondent to wait to get details from the presiding pastor when the service was over. He, however, said the suspect had been handed over to the police and moved to the Sabon Tasha Division of the Nigeria Police Force. According to Daily Post, an officer at the Sabo Police station confirmed that the suspect had actually been brought to the Police Station.
