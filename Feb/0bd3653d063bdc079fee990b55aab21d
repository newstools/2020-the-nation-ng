Telecoms giant, Globacom has unveiled Glo Cloud, a cloud storage service for the benefit of its teeming subscribers. The service affords its customers the opportunity of backing up their photos, videos, music and documents, among other expressions of their digital lives. A statement from Globacom’s head office in Victoria Island, Lagos said the app was provisioned to assist Glo data users to safely and privately store, back up, retrieve and share their digital content from their cloud account. Customers are able to purchase any amount of storage capacity, depending on individual requirements. The operator said anyone who subscribes for 50GB will be able to store up to 50GB of content in his personal Glo Cloud storage. “We are in a digital age where people develop loads and loads of personal, social and business content, which they wish to store and retrieve whenever and wherever they want. Glo Cloud provides a safe and secure place to store such content. “Apart from the problem of having enough storage space on phones or laptops, the Glo Cloud customer is assured of the safety of his documents or contents if he loses his phone or computer,” the statement said. To benefit from the service, all a Glo subscriber needs to do is to download the Glo Cloud application from Google Play or Apple store by searching with its name “Glo Cloud”. Once download is successfully completed, the customer can then subscribe to the required pack by registering for the service.
