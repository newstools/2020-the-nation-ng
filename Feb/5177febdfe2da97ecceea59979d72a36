The oaths were administered on them by the Bayelsa Chief Justice, Kate Abiri, in line with Sections 185 and 187 of the 1999 Constitution as amended. Abiri , who was accompanied by other robbed judges, referred to the occasion as the solemn function of the judiciary describing the event as unique as it fell on Valentine Day. She recalled that in 2012 when she swore in former Governor Seriake Dickson, she enjoined the people of Bayelsa to pray for his government. She further appealed to the people of the state to extend such prayers to the new government to lead a successful administration.
