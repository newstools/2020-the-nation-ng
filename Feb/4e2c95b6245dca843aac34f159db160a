Award winning film producer, Emem Isong Misodi whose work Special Jollof recently got released into cinemas nationwide, said the movie is different from her other works done in the past. Speaking at the media screening, the producer, Emem Isong said: “This movie is actually different from what I normally do and because it is a well talked about issue worldwide at the moment, causing a concern for world leaders, I just felt I should speak on it. Let’s abolish the hate and have more love. And because I was in the states for a while, I decided to do something on immigrants, in Houston, especially, where there is a large community of Nigerians. I want to believe I actually achieved my purpose.” “Special Jollof is just a love story set with immigration as the background. It dwells on problems immigrants face and this preconceived notion that every Immigrant is involved in illegal activities,” she explained. Isong noted that it was a bit challenging to get the right locations and white actors “One of the major challenges we faced was finding foreign actors, so, I had to hold an audition but thank God, the turnout was really impressive. Another challenge was finding locations and getting people to open up to you. I was new to that terrain, so, it was quite challenging for me.” “I chose the name Special Jollof because I wanted something that would attract Nigerians, and of course, it is set in the background of a restaurant and jollof rice, which has always been controversial, so, it just fit.” Special Jollof which was shot in America and Nigeria stars top actors including  Joseph Benjamin, Bukky Wright, Uche Jombo, Joseph Benjamin, Bukky Wright, Chiwetalu Agu among others. The movie tells a story of a white American journalist who after a heart break with her lover works as an undercover at a Nigerian restaurant to prove that Nigerians migrate illegally to the USA. She eventually falls in love with a Nigerian.
