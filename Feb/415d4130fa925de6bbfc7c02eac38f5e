The Delta Police Command has confirmed the killing of a Director in the Delta State Ministry of Works, Mr Ugo Onochie, by gunmen. The Command’s spokesperson, DSP Onome Onovwakpoyeya, told newsmen on Monday in Asaba that the incident happened on Sunday in Illah community, Oshimili North local government area of the state. “The man was with his driver when he was shot dead. The driver survived the attack and is currently receiving treatment at the Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Asaba. “From what we have gathered so far the attack looks more like an assassination. “The police have commenced investigation into the killing,” Onovwakpoyeya said. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), however, gathered that Onochie, who resides in Asaba, was in Illah on Sunday to inspect ongoing works in his building site when he was killed. When NAN visited the premises of the State Ministry of Works, where the late Onochie worked as an Engineer before his death, many of the staff members were seen in pensive mood. As they mourned the death of their director many described the deceased as ‘a jolly-good fellow’.  (NAN)
