It is also a universal academic tradition for any would-be scholar in pursuit of education. “Delta State University is one of the fourth generation universities in Nigeria having been established in 1992 by the late Olorogun Felix Ovuodoraye Ibru, the first Governor of Delta State.  It has grown from a modest beginning to be highly- rated citadel of research and higher learning. ‘’While I congratulate the matriculating students, l want to use this medium to advise the students to be mindful of the fact that they are the major stakeholders in the university. I therefore implore them to maintain the sanctity and esteemed image of the university. Most importantly, they should remain focused  in their academic pursuits at all times in order to achieve a fruitful academic career.” The Vice Chancellor also advised the students to shun any misconduct such as, examination malpractice, cultism, indecent dressing and other vices capable of bringing the institution to disrepute. He assured them that  the leadership and staff of the university are committed to their welfare at all times.
