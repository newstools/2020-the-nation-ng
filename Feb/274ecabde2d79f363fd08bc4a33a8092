 LAGOS State Government has trained about 4,000 people under the World Bank and Federal Government assisted APPEALS project, to empower farmers at the grassroots in aquaculture, poultry, rice production and marketing. The project, which cuts across six states, has a vote of $200million for six states, with each state focusing on areas of agriculture where it has advantage. Deputy Governor Dr. Obafemi Hamzat, who is the chairman of the state steering committee of the project, disclosed this after the committee’s meeting at his office in Alausa to approve the project’s annual work plan and budget prepared by the state coordinating office. Briefing reporters after the meeting, Hamzat said the state is focusing on its advantaged areas, which are aquaculture, poultry and rice production. He says it is to help farmers improve on their productivity. “We have varieties of Ofada rice and when it comes to processing, it becomes difficult. It is better to have one strain to improve on productivity. “Right now, rice farmers are doing two tons per hectare, but that is too small. They need to get it to 4, 5, 6 tons per hectare. This is the type of support the project is supposed to do for a lot of people,” the deputy governor said. He said those trained would from 2020 go into practical part of it, to do the real work, “and this is what will happen this year.” The deputy governor said that the people had also been trained in marketing.
