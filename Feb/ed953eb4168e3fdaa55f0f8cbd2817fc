 Bringing together security personnel to collaborate with the ministry will ensure the prevention of conflict and all forms of violence against women and girls, further institute coping mechanisms and systems for averting and mitigating disaster” These were the words of the Commissioner for Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation, Hon. Mrs. Cecilia Bolaji Dada, at a one-day sensitisation programme on Women’s Peace and Security held at Prestige Hotels, Agidingbi, Ikeja, Lagos. Dada said the conference was organised by the Lagos State government through the Ministry of Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation to sensitise security personnel on the need to align with the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 (UNSCR1325) which reaffirms the importance of equal participation and involvement of women in all processes of peace keeping, conflict resolution and management. The workshop, Dada pointed out, will help to promote gender equality and women’s participation in decision making processes within their domain. Her words: “The ministry will ensure that any violence against the girl-child or woman constitutes a criminal offence, whether committed inside or outside the home, and perpetrators prosecuted accordingly.” Speaking on ‘Security Personnel’s Role in Women Global Change’, the Chief Superintendent Civil Defence and Security Corps, Mrs. Evans-Emmanuel Olutoyin, charged participants on the need to change their perspective on what the role of women is. “Our role as women should not be such as to compete with the male counterpart but rather to collaborate with them to achieve a common goal. Rather than saying ‘what a man can do, a woman can do better’, let it be ‘what a man can do, let the woman do it if she can,’” she said.
