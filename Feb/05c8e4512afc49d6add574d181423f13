A Customary Court in Nyanya, Abuja, on Monday, dissolved a seven-year-old marriage between Ekene Odinaka and his wife Chioma Odinaka, over constant fighting. The judge, Fati Sarki, dissolved the marriage on the ground of lack of love and peace in the union. “It is on record that the respondent refused to come to court to defend herself on the allegations filed against her by her husband, despite the hearing notice effected on her severally. “In view of this, the court has no other choice than to grant the petitioner his prayer of divorce since he said he can forfeit the dowry. “The marriage is hereby dissolved and dowry forfeited, and certificate of divorce issued to the petitioner. “The petitioner is also ordered to give N10,000 to the respondent for the monthly upkeep of the only child of the marriage,” Sarki said. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Ekene, a public servant, dragged Chioma to court, seeking dissolution of the marriage on grounds of lack of love and peace in the union. “I am exhausted in this marriage. Since I married my wife seven years ago, I have not known peace. “She is always fighting me. The worst of it all is that she pours water on me to disturb my sleep. “She goes around castigating me. She tells everyone who cares to listen to her that I am a bad man. This has greatly tarnished my image,” he told the court. (NAN)
