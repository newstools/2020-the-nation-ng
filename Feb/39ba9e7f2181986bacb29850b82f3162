 THE Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) will hold the Nigeria gas flare commercialisation programme (NGFCP) bidders’ conference on Monday in Lagos. According to the DPR’s Head, Public Affairs, Paul Osu, the bidders conference is for companies whose Statements of Qualification (SOQ) have been successfully evaluated, thereby attaining Qualified Applicants (QA) status and have been issued Request for Proposals (RFP) documents. The conference will provide a platform to engage with every qualified stakeholder to provide further clarifications on the RFP and commercial agreements and other matters relating to the NGFCP programme. The NGFCP is a programme designed  by government to provide a commercial approach to eliminate routine gas flaring by creating value from flare gas through the capture and transformation of waste gas into useful products.
