Fifteen Nigerians have  won in the MTN Nigeria’s ‘Turn It Up’ campaign in  Aba. This is coming after the Information Community Telecommunication (ICT) company launched the campaign with an inspiring TVC in Lagos. At the Aba leg of the activation, 10 Nigerians received grants to boost their businesses and careers as MTN explored interesting ways to ‘turn it up’ for the exciting audience. One of the winners, Mary Thomas, a recycler who collects leather waste from  Aba market and turns them into beautiful products shared her challenge of not having the best tools to turn her business into a big enterprise. MTN Nigeria has supported her with N1 million  grant to improve her business within the next few weeks. Through the MTN Foundation, these Nigerians who were selected randomly from the audience will receive support to ‘Turn Up’ their businesses. They will also undergo a  capacity building session sponsored by the Foundation, to enhance their entrepreneurial capacity. With Turn it Up, MTN Nigeria aims to encourage Nigerians to search within, think out of the box and ‘turn up’ their businesses, personal lives, their imaginative and innovative energies with the company’s extensive portfolio of products and services. These will serve as the medium to achieve their goals and dreams.
