A septuagenarian gun maker recently arrested by the police in Delta State, Ezekiel Idoghor, has denied making guns for armed robbers. He said his clients were vigilance group members, hunters and ‘respectable’ men in the society, adding that he did not encourage any of his 45 children to learn the art of making gun. Idoghor, who was paraded at the state police command headquarters in Asaba, the state capital, said he was a hunter and farmer. As a member of the vigilance group in Patani, he said he underwent training in Jos, Plateau State capital. He said he learnt the art of gun making from a deceased artisan at Enwhe community in Isoko South Local Government Area. Idoghor said he had made over 20 guns, which he sold for N12,000 each, adding that he had been making guns since 2012. While urging the police to release one of his sons called Prosper, he denied training any of his children how to make guns. He said: “I have five wives and 45 children. I did not teach any of my children to make gun. I do not know why he (Prosper) was arrested. I want him to be set free because he is innocent.”
