Elo Edremoda, Warri  A man identified as Francis Nwabueze has been arrested by a Police team of ‘Operation Safe Delta’, over alleged attempt to purchase a gun in Warri, Delta state. The suspect who was apprehended around Marine Quarters on Saturday, was said to have called a notable personality (name withheld), on telephone, making enquiries on how to buy a gun. The person, suspecting foul play, began posing questions to the suspect on why he wanted a gun. But Nwabueze could not give good reasons. He allegedly turned off the telephone when the questions became unbearable. Efforts to reconnect the line failed, as he seemed to have barred the phone number from calling him. The Nation gathered that the OSD squad got wind of the matter, tracked the suspect through his phone and arrested him. The Delta State Police Command confirmed the development. Commissioner of Police, Mr. Hafiz Inuwa, said, “what happened was that he called someone telling him that he wants to buy a gun, so we intercepted him via their conversation. “We went after him. You know going after them is a painstaking issue. It happened since last week. We just started trailing him. At the end of it all, our men stumbled into his compound today and arrested him. “He is in the hands of Operation Safe Delta. I think they are even taking him to Asaba now. We will interrogate him to know what he is up to.”
