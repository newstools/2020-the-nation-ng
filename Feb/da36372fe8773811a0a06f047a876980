 A detachment of Mobile Police team numbering about 100 has reportedly arrived Umuahia, the Abia State capital. The Nation gathered that the policemen were camped at the Abia State Command Headquarters. It was gathered that apart from the deployment of uniformed personnel of various security agencies to various flashpoints in the state capital, some plain- clothed security personnel would equally be deployed to the venue of the commendation service and Afaraukwu community. They are to prevent any breakdown of law and order in the community and the state capital. Our correspondent, who went round the Isiama Afaraukwu Community, spotted policemen around the community with an Armoured Personnel Carrier (APC) on the road leading to the Ojukwu Bunker. Some of the village elders were seen around Nnamdi Kanu’s compound apparently to tidy things properly ahead of the burial of their monarch (HRH Eze Israel Kanu) and wife, Ugoeze Sally Meme Okwu Kanu. Residents of Isiama Afaraukwu and some residents of Umuahia, the state capital have expressed fears over the recent tension caused by the recent comments between the police and other security outfits in the state, and members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). Our reporter gathered that some Afaraukwu residents who feared that their lives may be in danger left their homes on Thursday. Unconfirmed reports have it that owners of private schools especially around the Isiama Community have declared Friday school-free for safety of their workers and students. But some elders in Kanu’s community however said there was no need for people to panic, expressing confidence the burial would be peaceful.
