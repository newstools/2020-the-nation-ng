The Academy Director of Study, CWG Academy, Mr. Effiong Emmanuel, has advised youths to imbibe the spirit of hard work and shun the idea of taking easy way to wealth. He spoke to the new intakes for the capacity building yesterday when they resumed for the 2020 academic session. He said: “Going to work does not mean you are working. When you go to work, ask yourself what you have done each day. Don’t believe in cheap money. Work for the money as success doesn’t just happen. It is a factor of hard work and patience.” In the module for the 2020 session, the students will be trained on Customer Service Management, Service Excellence and Culture Training, Foundation Training, Customer Service Essentials, Customer Care and Project Management. Others are Project Management and Project Office, Electronic Bills Presentment Payment, Unified Corporative Platform, Positive Communications and Winning Attitude, Sales and Presales Strategies and Processes, Career in IT, IT Security, Enterprise Risk Management and Point Of Sales. One of the students, Nwacheta David,  a graduate of Nautical Science from the Southtyneside Marine College in the United Kingdom, said: “I signed up for the Academy to become an IT expert and to be up to date with the current trends in the IT world. From what I have seen and learned here, it is safe to say CWG Academy can be recommended for anybody that wants to pursue a career in IT.”
