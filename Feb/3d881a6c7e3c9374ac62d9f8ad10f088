Coordinator of Presidential Amnesty Programme (PAP) Prof. Charles Dokubo has hailed President Muhammadu Buhari’s determination to deepen peace and growth in Niger Delta. Dokubo said President Buhari had done well for the people, especially with Amnesty, which trained over 3,000 beneficiaries in less than two years. Dokubo spoke in Lagos at a ceremony organised by Bradama International Skill Works Limited, a leading construction firm in the oil and gas sector. He said the programme had achieved transformed lives of  beneficiaries. “We have had more than 3,000 beneficiaries who have been trained since I took over office. We have a job placement unit that places them on jobs. The government cannot provide everything; what government does is to create an enabling environment from which people can key into to get something. We believe that with time, the training will not be wasted. They will go back into the society and attain great heights. “I believe Amnesty has done a very good work with the support of the Federal Government. The Buhari administration has been particular about the Niger Delta, and I believe that if we can use what is available to us well, the region will be in a different place from what it is now. “The Federal Government is doing all it takes to ensure we don’t have hitches in running the programme; Amnesty is priority in terms of funding. The programme has run for about 10 years, and the Federal Government is still supporting the programme. We are in the last stage… that is reintegration. We have to train our people and bring them back to health so they will have jobs and earn salaries, which they will pay taxes from…”
