 NIGERIA’S Oyinlomo Quadre won all her matches at the International Tennis Federation (ITF) Junior Grade Three tournament in Pretoria, South Africa to emerge champion. The flawless champion was at her best as tenacity coupled with her humility paid off as she claimed her fist title outside West Africa. The highpoint for the 16-year-old sensation was the way she approached most of the matches in the singles. In the final, she proved her rating as the number the two seed when she humbled France’s Nahia Berecoechea 6-2, 6-3 to emerge as only players not drop a set. But she was not lucky in the doubles as her partnership with Morocco’s Salma Loudili failed to produce a victory against Morocco’s Sara Akid and Yasmine Kabbaj. Having lost the first set in a closed encounter at 6-7, Quadre and her partner restored parity by winning the second set 6-1. But they were unlucky in the final set as their unforced errors became their undoing and they lost 12-10. Already before her departure in 2019 to the ITF High Performance Centre in Morocco, Quadre has established herself as the best female player in Nigeria winning most of the tournaments while she also made it to the quarterfinal stage of the Lagos Tennis Open in 2019.
