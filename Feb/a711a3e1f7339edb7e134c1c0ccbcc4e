 FOLLOWING the viral photograph of a pupil, Rasheed Fathia Dele, doing her homework with the illumination from an ATM facility on Yaba Road in Ondo City, Ondo State, Lumos Nigeria, the leading home solar system provider, has installed a free solar-powered system at her home to ensure access to power supply for her and her family. The installation held on February 12, about 48 hours after the photograph surfaced online, adding Dele and her family to the over 100,000 households and small businesses already connected to Lumos in Nigeria. Chief Executive of Lumos Nigeria Mrs. Adepeju Adebajo said the intervention is a testament to the company’s commitment to helping Nigerians grow and achieve their dreams. “With the newly installed solar-powered system, Dele can now do her schoolwork in the comfort of her home while the family enjoys uninterrupted access to power. “Dele’s story epitomises the Nigerian ‘Can Do’ spirit in the face of obstacles. We are pleased, as a company, to have supported Dele’s quest to seek education and will continue to do more. “We made similar gestures when we provided 100 units of our solar-powered systems to the Army as part of our contribution to tackling terrorism in the Northeast.”
