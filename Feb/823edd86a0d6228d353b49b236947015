A Kano High Court presided by Justice Ahmad Tijjani Badamasi on Friday sentenced a Kano-based house wife, Rashida Saidu to death by hanging The convict was charged following her alleged complicity in the death of her husband, Dr Adamu Ali, who was until his death, a staff of the Federal College of Education, Kano. Prosecution Counsel, Mariam Jilbrin, had told the court that Mrs Saidu engaged her husband in a fistcuff at their residence in Dorayi Quarters about a year ago during which she pushed him down from a storey building, which eventually led to his death The prosecution produced four witnesses to the court to prove their charge against the suspect. However, the suspect through her lawyer, Illiya Dauda, denied the charge and proceeded to produce two witnesses to counter the allegation of culpability in the death of her husband. In his judgement however, the judge held that the prosecution had proven their case beyond reasonable doubt and that suspect was pivotal to the death of her 56 -year- old husband. The Judge, therefore, sentenced her to death by hanging The family of the late Dr Adamu Ali has described the death sentence passed on the ex- wife of their brother as just and fair, saying it has served the course of justice. A relative of the deceased, Ali Usman, who reacted to the judgement on behalf of the family held that with the judgement of the court, the right of the deceased has been upheld observing that justice has come the way of the deceased barely a year after his death.
