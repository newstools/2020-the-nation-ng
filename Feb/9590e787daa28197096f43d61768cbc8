Bolaji Ogundele, Abuja The Federal Executive Council (FEC) on Wednesday approved contracts worth N15 billion in the Water Resources and, Works and Housing Ministries. Addressing State House Correspondents after the FEC meeting, Minster of Water Resources, Engr. Suleiman Adamu, said his ministry presented a memo seeking for the variation and augmentation of the Tada Shonga Irrigation Project in Kwara State. According to him, the project, which was initiated in 2010, was to cover 1,500 hectares of irrigation, put then at the value of N3.263 billion. He however said the project has however been augmented and increased to 2,200 hectares of irrigation and the cost variated with an additional N6.3 billion, bringing the new project cost to a total of N10.18 billion. He said “we brought this augmentation and variation for Tada Shonga Irrigation Project, which is sited in Shonga in Kwara State. “The project was started in 2010, but was abandoned along the way and because of its huge potential for irrigation and especially for rice production, we made it a priority project in our ministry and therefore brought it to Council for an augmentation and request for variation to increase the size of the project because of the potentials it has from 1500 hectares to 2,300 hectares of irrigation. “The augmentation is for N6.9 billion, of course like I said, because of the variation, the variation includes 700 hectares increase, plus 2 megawatt solar power plant to replace the diesel power plant that was in the original design because, as you know diesel is expensive now so pumping will be unsustainable, the irrigation system will be unsustainable if we continue to rely on diesel. “So for that purpose we sought for the augmentation and variation in the sum of N6.9 billion, raising the project from the original sum of N3.263 billion to N10.18 billion, with the completion period of 36 months. Council was gracious enough to approve this project because of the huge potentials that it has for the food security policy and our desire to make agriculture a focal instrument of our economy”, he said. Disclosing the approvals obtained from the FEC for roads in Edo and Ondo States, the Minister of State for Works and Housing, Abubakar Aliyu, said the Council approved a memo for the augmentation of an ongoing project. According to him, the Benin-Adumagbe-Igba-Akure Road, which was awarded in 2013 and abandoned for lack of funding, would be resumed with the project cost now put at N4, 770,189,493. “The contract was awarded in December 2013, meaning we have inherited the project and as you all know, it’s the decision of President Muhammadu Buhari to continue and complete all ongoing projects. “This project was stopped for some time for lack of funding, now that the contractor wants to continue, the bill has to be reviewed. We have reviewed the contract from the original sum of N3,297,221,221.90 to N4,770,188,497, inclusive of VAT and tax, an increase of about N1.48 billion. “It was further reviewed down through the processes of going to BPP to the total sum of N4, 770, 189, 493,” he said.
