Nigeria’s representatives at the World Taekwondo (WT) Africa Olympic Qualifying Tournament kicks off tomorrow in Rabat, Morocco said they are ready to return to the Olympics after missing the last edition in Rio, Brazil. The four-man team led by experienced Chinazum Nwosu who is the African champion said the team is united in their quest to qualify for the Olympics. Nwosu, who narrowly missed Rio 2016 Olympic ticket, will be hopeful for different outcome in Rabat, where she won the African Games gold medal six months ago. She, however, admitted being under but promised that the team would spring surprise in Morocco. “It is normal to feel pressure but I am focused on the qualifiers and putting up the right mindset. As captain of the team, I know 100 per cent that the team is ready and focused on qualifying for the Olympics.” National champion and African Games bronze medalist, Benjamin Okuomose, who won his first major international medal when he came away with bronze at the 2019 African Games, will be looking to go a step further when he returns to Rabat this weekend. The Edo-State born athlete said his performance well at the Fujairah Open a fortnight ago has boosted his confidence. “The tournament at Fujairah helped build my confidence. I have been waiting and training for the day to come, although it has not been easy. I do not feel any tension and I am very ready to make Nigeria proud. I just have to stay focused,” said Okuomose. For his teammate and fellow bronze medalist at the 2019 All African Games and Fujairah Open, Elizabeth Anyanacho, the support from the Nigeria Taekwondo Federation, the taekwondo community and media has been very soothing and a big boost to the team’s preparation.
