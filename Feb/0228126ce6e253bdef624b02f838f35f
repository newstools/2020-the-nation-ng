 Ekiti State Governor Dr.Kayode Fayemi has promised to complete all abandoned projects initiated by previous administrations. This, he said, was part of his administrationâ€™s resolve to stop the ugly trend of project abandonment. The governor said completing the projects would not stop him from doing those conceived by his administration. Fayemi said the need to stop wastage of public funds, associated with abandoned projects necessitated the transition law forbidding new administrations from abandoning projects of previous administrations. He spoke in Ado-Ekiti while inspecting major project sites: Agbado-Ode-Omuo road; Igbemo-Ire-Ilupeju road; Aramoko-Erijiyan-Ikogosi road; Ado-Iyin road; College of Agriculture and Technology, Isan Ekiti. Others were Federal University, Oye-Ekiti (FUOYE) internal road project; State Secretariat Phase 5 Lots 1&2 buildings; House of Assembly chambers and the Assembly Commission buildings; ultra-modern civic centre and Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital (EKSUTH) internal road project. The governor said he was satisfied with the pace and quality of work, adding that the contractors would deliver the projects on time.
