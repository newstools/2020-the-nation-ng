 DMW Boss, Davido, has been presented with a plaque by Sony Music for his latest album A Good Time , which sales hit platinum and his single Blow my mind featuring American singer, Chris Brown, which hit double platinum as well. Davido and his team were in Sony Music’s headquarters in Johannesburg, South Africa to pick up the award. Presenting the plaque, Managing Director, Sony Music Entertainment Africa, Sean Watson said: “I know we have one thing in common, all of us love Africa, all of us love African music and all of us are working as hard as we can to make sure we move the needle so the whole world knows who we are, why we’re here and what we stand for. But tonight, I’m standing next to a pioneer. A man who has gone ahead of all of us … I want to say, Thank you and I want to give you something which is yours because you earned it and what that is again is that we’ve come around full circle to say we have something else to give you tonight … A platinum album, a double platinum single and a platinum single… This is from us, we love you .. we are proud of you and you are special to us.” Davido dropped A Good Time last November and since then has topped music charts across the world. Earlier, Davido received plaques when his songs Fall and If were certified diamond and platinum.
