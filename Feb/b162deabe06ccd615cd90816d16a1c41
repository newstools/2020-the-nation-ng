In the spirit of Valentine’s Day celebration, the Badagry Local Government Registry in Lagos State at the weekend celebrated four newly wedded couples in a unique way. The four lucky couples were given gifts by the council registry. In a colourful ceremony, they were conveyed in a branded Limousine car to places of attractions in the town to mark the Valentine’s Day. Some of the places visited included Badagry Museum, First Storey-Building, Suntai Beach and Slave Museum. The couples were also treated to special dishes and music at the places of interest they visited. The Marriage Registrar, Badagry Local Government Registry, Mrs. Omobolanle Ojuolape, urged the couples to understand themselves and trust one another for a peaceful marital life. She said: “Make everyday your Valentine’s Day, and learn how to celebrate one another everyday of your married life. “You must know and understand that there is no perfect man or woman on earth; we need to tolerate and be patient with one another. “You should know that you are from different background and when you come together we say you are one. “The secret of a successful marriage is patience. When you are patient and tolerate one another, then, your home will be perfect.” Mr. Samson Apata, a tour operator in Badagry, advised the couples to put God first in whatever they do. Apata, the Badagry Local Government  supervisor for Education and Tourism, enjoined the couples to remain one and speak with one voice. One of the couples, Mr. Solomon Daramola, thanked the council for giving them the opportunity to visit places of interest in Badagry. He thanked the registrar for the advice she gave them, promising that they would make use of it in building the foundation of their marriages.
