The Lagos State Commissioner of Police (CP), Hakeem Odumosu and the Force Public Relations Officer (FPRO) Frank Mba have canvassed support for the forthcoming 12th edition of the biennial Police Games scheduled for Anambra State. Speaking  in Lagos yesterday, Odumosu  who made a whistle stop at a media presser held by Mba, said sports is an essential  part of policing, adding that the force want to make a big statement about the capability of its officers to excel in sporting  activities. “Police is not only about security  but over time our officers  have equally shown the stuff they are made of by excelling in sporting activities and that is why  we are all eagerly looking forward to the forthcoming Akwa 2020 Police Games in Anambra,” Odumosu, an assistant inspector-general of police,  explained.“ Incidentally, Zone 2 which comprises of Lagos and Ogun State and where I’m now is the defending overall champions of the games held in 2016 in Abuja and we are going to Akwa 2020 to win more laurels.” Speaking broadly about Akwa 2020, Mba said the force high command thought it wise to resuscitate the games after almost four years of interregnum occasioned by paucity of funds and security exigencies across the country. Tracing the origin of the games since its inception in 1946, Mba said Nigeria Police is synonymous with sporting excellence, explaining that Akwa 2020 is strategically planned to achieve a three-prong purposes including improvement of officers’ fitness; unearthing talents that could represent the country as well as deepening community policing. Mba added: “Of course, you can’t quantify the gains of this kind of event because apart from helping fitness of the officers, the host community stand to gain so much because centres to be used for the  games have been renovated  to a very good standard and I’m talking about the Rojeny Games Village, the Police Training College in Oji River , NYSC orientation Camp  and Alex Ekwueme Square.” Mba hailed the support of the sport-loving Governor of Anambra State, Willie Obiano and Inspector General of Police (IGP) Mohammed Abubakar Adamu, while the games kicks off on February 29 to march 7, with over 3000 athletes from the 12 Zonal Police Commands and the Force Headquarters in Abuja expected to compete in 31 sporting events.
