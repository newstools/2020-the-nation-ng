The Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund) on Monday told the House of Representatives Committee on Public Accounts why it submitted its 2014 to 2016 accounts reports late. The agency attributed the delay to the absence of a Board of Trustees (BoT) within the period. It said this slowed down the signing and submission of its accounts. TETFund’s Executive Secretary, Prof Suleiman Bogoro, stated this when he appeared before Oluwole Oke-led committee at the National Assembly complex. The 2017 audit report from the Office of the Auditor-General of the Federation had alleged infractions in the accounts of TETFund within the period. But Bogoro told the committee that all the accounts were submitted in 2016 and 2018. He said the agency had evidence of submission of the 2014 account on February 4, 2016, with signatures of all the auditors, while a former executive secretary of the agency, Dr Abdullahi Baffa, signed the documents for the agency. Oke confirmed the submission of TETFund’s accounts of 2014, 2015 and 2016 in 2018. But the lawmaker noted that apart from the 2017 account of the agency, which was submitted on time, its 2014, 2015 and 2016 accounts were submitted late. Also, the change in audit personnel reportedly caused the delay in auditing the books of University of Ibadan (UI). The university’s Bursar, Dr. Michael Alatise, stated this when he appeared before the House of Representatives Committee on Public Account.
