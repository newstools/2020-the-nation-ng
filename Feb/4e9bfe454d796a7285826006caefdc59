Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu says the closure of the country’s border is necessary to protect the economy against unfair actions, which run contrary to acceptable norms. He spoke on Thursday in Lagos at the Centre for Values in Leadership (CVL) 17th Annual Lecture and International Leadership Symposium on Intra-African Trade Service. The theme was: ‘Intra African Trade: Growth and Economic Development’. The governor, represented by his Deputy, Dr. Obafemi Hamzat, stressed that trade between nations thrived on the commitment of parties to the principles of fairness, integrity and equity. “If these principles are breached with its attendant negative effects on the economy of one party, then the sustenance of trade relations and the mutual benefits that should accrue from such, would be threatened,” Sanwo-Olu said. According to him, it is wrong to view the border closure as an action against the objectives of promoting intra-African trade. Sanwo-Olu said the continent and individual countries “stand to gain a lot in terms of enhanced economic growth and development if greater attention is focused on improving the current level of intra-African trade. “The African Continental Trade Agreement (AfCTA), if well implemented, has a potential to increase intra-African trade by about 52 per cent by 2020,” Sanwo-Olu said.
