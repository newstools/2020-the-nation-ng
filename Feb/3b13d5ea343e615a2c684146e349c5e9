 OUTDOOR Advertising Association of Nigeria (OAAN) on Thursday in Lagos raised the alarm that dearth of infrastructure, piling debt burden, multiple regulation/taxation and others were killing the advertising industry. Its President, Mr. Emmanuel Ajufo, who spoke in Lagos, during the Presentation of the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) of OAAN in Conjunction with Advertising Practitioners Council of Nigeria (APCON), lamented that quackery, lack of internal cohesion and others were killing the industry. “While some of these challenges (infrastructure and regulation) may take a longer time to resolve, we believe that we can at least, start from the ones we can reasonably do something about. “Based on this conviction, we have started work on areas of concern such as industry research on effectiveness of Out of Home (OoH), which first phase has been commissioned and should come out by end of first quarter; rate card that will soon be released for discussion; expanding the membership realising that we have a lot of companies out there practicing without being in our fold. “We extended a hand of fellowship, which has attracted more members into our fold. We believe control is better handled from within,” Ajufo said, adding that internal cohesion was growing stronger with the launch of the OAAN Cooperative Society. He said the body was not unmindful of the global standard of doing business in the industry, but was seeking cooperation because of the very serious and peculiar business environment it operates which posed peculiar challenge.
