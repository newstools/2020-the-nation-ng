Lagos State Government says its Eko City Farmers’ Market will upgrade the agricultural supply value chains in the state by connecting the value chains with their markets. Agric Commissioner Prince Gbolahan Lawal, who disclosed this in Lagos at the weekend, noted that the Eko City Farmers’ Markets is a platform where the best of Lagos producers will meet with consumers and end users by using the traditional and innovative development methods to showcase a well organised high quality market to meet the consumers’ ever increasing demand for farm produce. Lawal, who said that the maiden edition of the market would hold in Lagos next Sunday at the Tafawa Balewa Square, Lagos Island and subsequently hold every last Sunday of every month, noted that the market would help the rebuilding of the local food economies by providing a cost-effective, retail sales prospect for local food producers in Lagos State and across Southwestern states. “The notable objectives of the Eko City Farmers’ Market are to provide Lagosians access to a wide variety of fresh, local, in-season farm products direct from the producers; to make Lagos the most desirable destination for businesses with direct socio-economic impact and beneficial returns; and an avenue to further champion regional integration through composite economic development, leveraging on the existing relationship with the Development Agenda for Western Nigeria (DAWN) Commission to coordinate the participation of other states,” the commissioner said. He added that the market will also provide an informal social gathering place in an open-air setting for the community where the market is situated as well as demonstrate environmental stewardship. “A conspicuous feature of the Eko-City Farmers’ Market is its inclusive model, which epitomises the farmers and the final end users as its focus; a situation that promotes productivity and profitability. In addition, the Eko City Farmers’ Market is also a veritable avenue for Lagosians to buy the poplar LAKE rice on a monthly basis,” Lawal said.
