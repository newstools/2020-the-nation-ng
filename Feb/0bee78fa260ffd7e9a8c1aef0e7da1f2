Manchester United have revealed Odion Ighalo’s squad number after his shock deadline day arrival at Old Trafford. The former Watford striker arrived in Manchester from China on Sunday, following his six-month loan switch from Shanghai Shenhua. The 30-year-old, who grew up as a United fan idolising Dwight Yorke and Andrew Cole, joins the Old Trafford club for the remainder of the season. The Nigerian international will wear No 25 during his stay in Manchester. Ighalo turned down the overtures of another Premier League club to join United, where he will help address a short-term injury issue for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side. He scored 16 times in 55 Premier League appearances for Watford before moving to Changchun Yatai in January 2017, and then Shanghai Shenhua two years later. “Odion is an experienced player. He will come in and give us an option of a different type of centre-forward for the short spell he’s staying with us,” Solskjaer said.
