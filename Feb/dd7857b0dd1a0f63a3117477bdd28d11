82- year-old Mrs. Alice Fadeni, who was abducted a week ago at Ode-Aye in Okitipupa Local Government area of Ondo State, has regained freedom. Chief Sehinde Fadeni, a Lagos-based businessman and son of the octogenarian, confirmed this to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), on the telephone on Friday. The octogenarian was abducted on Jan. 28 at her residence in Ode-Aye and was whisked to an unknown destination by her abductors.
Fadeni said someone called him that his mother was at an undisclosed hospital in Ore, in Odigbo Local Government area, where she was picked. He, however, declined paying any ransom before his mother was released. “Yes, she was released yesterday night (Thursday), as someone called me that she was in an undisclosed hospital in Ore. “The police did their best for her release; I thank everyone, including journalists, who showed concern before my mother was released. “No one called me for any ransom and no ransom was paid,” Fadeni said. CSP Femi Joseph, the Public Relations Officer of the state Police Command, also confirmed the release of Mrs Fadeni to NAN on the telephone. He said that the ultimate concern of the police was that she was released unhurt, adding that investigation was still on to arrest the perpetrators of the crime and bring them to justice. “The old woman has been released unhurt, which is our major concern, but we are not closing our investigation yet; we are working to ensure that the perpetrators are arrested and brought to justice,” he said. NAN reports that the octogenarian had been taken to Lagos for proper medical examination. (NAN)
