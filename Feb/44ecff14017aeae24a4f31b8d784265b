 WEMA Bank’s ALAT has excited travellers with the ALAT airport mural. The ALAT mural sprang out of an understanding of how travelling evokes different emotions in different people – excitement, paranoia, fear, anxiety, to list a few, and the need for them to hold on to the memories that matter to them. The ALAT brand has positioned itself and been known to be the brand that no only offers Nigerians convenient banking services but that also supports their lifestyle. The bank’s Chief Communications Officer, Funmilayo Falola, said for ALAT and Wema Bank, marketing is more than just the direct sale of a product or service, it is about creating an experience for the customer. She stated that infusing conversations and storytelling into advertising and marketing communications is one of the strategies the bank is applying to engage existing customers and gain new ones. The ALAT airport mural is one of the many ways the bank expresses its interest in the stories and overall lifestyle of its expanding customer base. It is dedicated to the many and widely varying Lagos experiences across both the Mainland and the Island. The new boarding gate look at MM2 gives boarders a walk-through of iconic places in Lagos for travelers, who are often filled with a mirage of emotions at the point of leaving a place for another. At the ALAT mural, they can identify places they are familiar with in Lagos, maybe have a flash of unforgettable memories they’ve had in those places or remember what those places mean to them and have a pretty background to take one or two selfies before they board to fly out of Lagos.
