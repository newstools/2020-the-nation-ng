 Everton and Super Eagles ace Alex Iwobi has revealed what we see of him is influenced by some secrets he got from legends Austin Okocha and Thierry Henry. While Iwobi was focused on getting a buzz from tricks he did on friends, Arsenal’s French legend Henry soon told him goal output takes higher importance. “Growing up, I’d go for nutmegs, try to embarrass my friends,” Iwobi said. Thierry told me that attackers are remembered for goals and assists, and I needed to get that in my head. Something clicked.” Additionally, the player’s iconic cousin Okocha stressed the importance of expression and playing with freedom without the fear of making errors. “Uncle Jay-Jay encouraged me to enjoy it. If you make a mistake, try again. I have stuck by that and will never hide,” Iwobi added. “Now, it’s up to me to make a name for myself at Everton.” The 23 year-old joined Everton this summer after spending 11 years with Arsenal and has scored twice for the Toffees in 22 matches.
