The Osun State Police Command on Tuesday paraded a 42-year-old, Adesina Adeniyi and 58-year-old Oluwole Olapade for allegedly being possession of two human skulls and a decomposing liver. Also, the command paraded two suspected armed robbery suspects who were captured after a gun duel with police at Osu in Atakumosa West Local Government Area of the state. The Commissioner of Police, Johnson Kokumo while parading the suspects, said Adeniyi, a patent medicine shop owner, was arrested in Iwo while traveling on a commercial bus to Ibadan, Oyo State. The CP said, “The suspect who resides at Kajola area in Iwo disclosed that the skull and the liver were recovered from a Muslim cemetery and a mortuary where he was an attendant”. “Following the gruesome murder of Favour Oladele-Daley, we have pledged to rid the state of ritual elements and during one of such efforts, a suspected ritualist was caught with two human skulls and other human parts,” the CP said. “After the arrest of the suspect and upon diligent investigation, his accomplice, Oluwole Olapade, a resident of Yemetu in Ibadan was trailed and arrested”. Olapade, a native doctor, who required human skull for charm had pledged to pay N20,000 per skull to the attendant. He was said to have got a skull before which he claimed did not produce money, hence he decided another skull should be procured for use.”
