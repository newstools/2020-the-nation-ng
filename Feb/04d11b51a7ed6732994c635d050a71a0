 The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ondo state has reacted to a statement credited to the Commissioner for Information, Mr. Donald Ojogo on behalf of the government that former Deputy Governor of the state decamped to the All Progressives Congress (APC) from the PDP. A statement by its spokesman, Zadok Akintoye said “Alhaji Lasisi Oluboyo was not a member of the PDP, having left the party with the former Governor, Dr. Olusegun Mimiko for the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) from where he sought to decamp to the PDP early this year but eventually never did due to the party’s inability to meet his demands. “We wish him and others the best in their chosen adventure in the APC and assure all faithful PDP members that the party remains very committed to our collective aspiration to win the next gubernatorial election.”
