 A HOUSEWIFE Risikat Ajape on Wednesday asked an Area Court in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital, to dissolve her 13-year-old marriage to Ambali, saying she no longer loved him. “My lord, I want an end to this marriage because I no longer love Ambali. I cannot continue to make myself unhappy. “He is an irresponsible man. He does not care for our three children anymore,” she alleged. She prayed the court to grant her custody of the children and order Ambali to pay N15,000 as children’s school fees and feeding allowance monthly. Responding, Ambali prayed the court to grant his wife’s prayer for divorce. He however, said that he cannot afford to pay N15,000 monthly for their children’s school fees and feeding, Judge Abdulkadri Ibrahim dissolved the marriage and issued Risikat a certificate of divorce. The court, however, ordered the petitioner to wait for three months before remarrying.
