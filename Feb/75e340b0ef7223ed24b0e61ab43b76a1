Two men were on Thursday remanded in correctional centres on charges of having carnal knowledge of minors. Their cases were heard separately in chief magistrate courts in Ikeja, the Lagos State capital. Forty-two-year-old James Anietie was ordered to be remanded  in Kirikiri Correctional Service for allegedly defiling his 11-year-old daughter. Chief Magistrate P.E. Nwaka, who did not take Anietie’s plea, ordered that the case file be returned to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) for legal advice. Nwaka adjourned the case until March 2 for mention. Earlier, the Prosecution Counsel, Inspector Christopher John, told the court that the defendant committed the offence on January 24 at 11pm at his residence. John said the offence contravened the provisions of Section 137 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. One Adeleke Adebanjo, 59, was also remanded in Kirikiri for allegedly defiling his nine-year-old housekeeper, pending legal advice. Chief Magistrate P.E. Nwaka, who did not take Adebanjo’s plea, ordered that the case file be returned to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) for advice. Nwaka adjourned the case until March 23, for mention. The Prosecutor, Inspector Christopher John, told the court that the defendant committed the offence sometime in 2019, at his residence. John alleged that Adebanjo forcefully defiled his housekeeper when his wife was not around. ”The case was reported to the police and the defendant was arrested,” the prosecutor said. John said the offence contravened Section 137 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.
