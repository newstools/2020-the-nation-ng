Filmmakers, under the auspices of Arewa Film Makers Association of Nigeria (AFMAN), have said they were keen on dialoguing with pirates over their copyright infringement. AFMAN chairman Ahmed Kaka said the group is willing to dialogue to ensure a mutually-beneficial legal and business environment. Kaka spoke when he led a delegation to visit Director-General of the Nigerian Copyright Commission (NCC), John Asein, at the commission’s Headquarters in Abuja. While raising concern over the large scale of local and foreign piracy, Kaka listed their major challenges to include ‘rampant activities of illegal downloaders, voice-over translators and inadequate knowledge of players in the industry’. He said: “AFMAN, in appreciation of the efforts of the commission towards sanitising the film industry, is seeking for areas of partnership to boost its anti-piracy drive to protect the rights of its members.” NCC and AFMAN resolved to partner to develop the film industry in the North to ensure its sustainable growth and economic viability. Asein assured AFMAN that NCC was disposed to brokering discussions between the film makers and copyright infringers like unauthorised downloaders, ‘to structure a business plan that would allow all sides to maximise the benefits of the copyright system’. He urged stakeholders to furnish the commission with vital intelligence on the activities of suspected pirates, adding that ‘we will do everything to provide you with a conducive legal and administrative environment to grow your business; hence the need to work together in crafting appropriate solutions’.
