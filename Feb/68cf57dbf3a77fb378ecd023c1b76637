By Donatus Nadi, Lafia  A two-time Speaker of the Nasarawa Assembly, Hon. Musa Ahmed Mohammed, has explained he dumped the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to enable him support the policies of President Muhammadu Buhari and Governor Abdullahi Sule. Mohammed, who made this known in an interview with our reporter on Thursday in Nasarawa local government area of Nasarawa state, said the multi-dimensional changes recorded under President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration has proven that the All Progressives Congress(APC) has what it takes to drive the needed development in the country. Mohammed, who was Speaker between 2007–2015, explained that Governor Sule has also left no one in doubt of his ability to transform the state despite his short stay in office. “Within his limited period in office, Governor Sule has shown good signs of what we should expect. “Within the period he has succeeded in tackling the menacing security situation in the state, especially along the Nasarawa-Toto axis which was notorious for kidnappings and other criminal activities. “For the first time we now have soldiers in our communities on this axis. These are signals of good things to come and I have decided to give this move the needed support in the collective interest of our people”. Mohammed disclosed that he has officially resigned his membership of the PDP from his ward and would be formally received into the APC by Governor Sule at a date yet to be fixed.
