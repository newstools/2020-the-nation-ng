Nigeria Aviation Handling Company (Nahco Aviance), has re-affirmed its commitment to the growth and development of agricultural export. This is as the company expanded its facilities to boost the volume of export of products it handles by 68 per cent. The development became important following the Federal Government’s border closure policy, which made the  need for Nigeria to produce enough for her consumption as well as export imperative. The Group Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Nahco Aviance, Mrs. Tokunbo Fagbemi, made these known at the “Africa Agric Expo,”co-sponsored by the handling firm. At the event, which was the maiden edition, Mrs Fagbemi explained that the company’s aim was to halt the rejection of Nigeria’s export goods  over inability to meet international standards. Assuring stakeholders of a brighter and better year, the Nahco Aviance boss revealed that the handling firm was ready to partner other agencies and stakeholders in the agricultural value chain to reduce the wastage of agricultural products, especially as a result of lack of equipment to preserve them.
