By Akinola Ajibade  Nigeria would continue to operate below 5,000 megawatts (Mw), as long as the Federal Government fails to explore the opportunities for electricity generation, the Chief Executive Officer, Power Cam Nigeria Limited, Mr Biodun Ogunleye, has said. The country boasts of 7,500Mw, a figure that is far less than the total generation capacity of 13,000Mw. In an interview with The Nation, Ogunleye said the country’s power generation would increase greatly, once stakeholders, including the Federal Government, tap into every opportunity to increase generation. According to him, countries in developed markets, such as United States, United Kingdom, Russia and others, understand the need to improve generation and, therefore, make use of various opportunities available to them. Citing International Oil Companies (IOCs), Ogunleye said  they have taken good steps by supplying gas to the thermal plants, while at the same time owning their power generation companies.  Shell, Chevorn, Mobil and others, he said, have taken up the responsibility of adding to the electricity megawatts in the country, urging them to sustain their efforts. He advised the government to encourage the issue of siting power generation plants, by private individuals and firms, adding that when this is done, the country would in a better place. ” Why are we complaining that the economy is in a bad shape? The reason is that the stakeholders, especially the Federal Government, refuse to the needful, by allowing as many companies, as possible to come into the electricity generation nets in Nigeria,” he said. Off-grid electricity, Ogunleye said, would generate a reasonable quantum of electricity for Nigeria, if the government, has been supporting the idea. According to him, some countries in Europe and America provide electricity, which would meet their social and economic needs, because they do not neglect opportunities for generation.
