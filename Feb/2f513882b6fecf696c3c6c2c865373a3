 The list of players that will prosecute the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) Nations Cup qualifier double-header against Sierra Leone’s Leone next month will be released later this month. Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr said he has been in touch with the players in readiness for the qualifiers. “Yes, we are already in February and the matches are in March and we are in constant touch with all our players.” Rohr said. “We are going to make our list at the end of the month  so that we can prepare for the match,” he added. The Super Eagles will host their West African neighbours on March 23 and will travel to Freetown for the return leg eight days later. Nigeria top Group L with the maximum six points after victories over Lesotho and Benin Republic last year. Rohr however, expressed his delight following the return to action of right-back Tyronne Ebuehi after a long lay-off due to injury. Rohr added that he hopes to now see him play regularly for the remainder of the season. “We are happy with the comeback of Ebuehi, he is back now with the Benfica first team. We were expecting it and we hope to see him soon again,” Rohr told AOIFootball.com “We’ve missed him for a long time and if he is playing regularly, of course, he has all the chances to come back with the Super Eagles.”
