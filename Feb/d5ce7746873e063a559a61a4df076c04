 AS the row over restriction of okada and keke on some routes in Lagos continues, Eze Ndigbo and Chairman Council of Eze Ndigbo in Lagos, Christian Uchechukwu Nwachukwu has said the move by the government would save life and property. Eze Nwachukwu spoke yesterday at the Igbo Community Centre in Okota, Isolo, Lagos. He stressed there should be sanity in the transportation sector, arguing that “our roads have become unsafe due to the reckless manner motorcycles and tricycles operate.’’ Nwachukwu regretted the lack of decorum on the part of operators. ‘’They ride against traffic which is punishable under the Lagos State transportation guidelines.” He said government could not fold its arms and watch helplessly as okada riders take laws into their hands. “If you visit any of the general hospitals, the number of those who are being treated of severe wounds, which resulted from okada accidents will scare you. ‘’Many have died during accidents involving motorcycle operators. “The action taken by the Lagos State government by restricting the operation of okada and keke riders from some roads and areas shows that it is responsive to the well-being of residents. ‘’By that singular action, lives of residents will be secured,” he said.
