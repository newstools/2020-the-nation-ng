 More than 15 persons have been killed since Monday February 17 in renewed rival cult war across Edo State. It was gathered that the killings were to mark one year anniversary of the killing of two rival leaders in Aye and Eiye confraternities. Eight persons were killed on Tuesday at Nomayo junction, Aifuwa and Three House area along Upper Sokponba road in Ikpoba-Okha local government Witnesses described the scene as a war theatre. One man said over 30 persons hid inside his shop at Three House junction while the cult boys were shooting sporadically. At the notorious third junction, four persons were killed while others were killed in different parts of the state. It was gathered that some suspects arrested in connection to last year’s cult killings especially two leaders of eiye and aye confraternities were released last month. Policemen were later seen at the third junction arresting suspected cultists but residents in the area accused the policemen of arresting traders and artisans. When contacted for comments, Edo police spokesman, DSP Chidi Nwabuzor, said he was yet to be briefed on the cult killings. DSP Nwabuzor however said the police as an institution have a right to randomlý arrest people within the vicinity of crime, screen them and release those found innocent.
