 Ondo State Government yesterday reacted to a report credited to the lawmaker representing Ondo North Senatorial District, Prof. Ajayi Boroffice that the Unity Forum within the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) would present one candidate for the primaries ahead of the October 10 governorship election. A statement by the Chief Press Secretary (CPS) to the governor, Segun Ajiboye, said: “The perception of the pernicious outburst of the senator was to ignore him because such was misguided. “At best, empathy was most desirable for a man whose lust for excessive mischief has spurred him to paths of perfidy against his Southwest kinsmen.  “The public, especially all lovers of our dear party, the APC, deserve to know that the vituperations of Senator Borofice are fallouts of deflated hopes. “This is more so that his huge investment to destroy the party and stem the pace of development in Ondo State appears to have yielded no positive results.” It noted that Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu believes in the right of all qualified persons to aspire to be governor, it is perhaps, untoward on the part of supposed leaders to be unrestrained in the pursuit of their ambitions.
