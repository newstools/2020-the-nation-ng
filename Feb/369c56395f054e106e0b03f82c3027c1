 THE ghost of National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) discharge certificate is still haunting the nation almost 17 months after it consumed a former Minister of Finance, Mrs. Kemi Adeosun. This time around, another female head of a money-spinning agency was unceremoniously removed by President Muhammadu Buhari, following intelligence report that she did not have NYSC discharge certificate. The erstwhile CEO, who claimed to have served in Kwara State, was discovered not to have participated in the NYSC scheme. The travails of the ex-CEO began in January this year when a Civil Society Organisation (CSO) raised the alarm that she did not present discharge or exemption certificate of the NYSC for screening. And when the top official was invited to show proof that she underwent the compulsory one-year programme in 1989/90, she only claimed she lost the discharge certificate. Security agencies were said to have dug deeper and uncovered that she skipped the service. Despite her closeness to the First Family, President Muhammed Buhari wielded the big stick.
