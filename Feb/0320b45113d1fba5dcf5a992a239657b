 A 12-YEAR-OLD boy has committed suicide in Agboala Ishiala Umudi community in Nkwerre council of Imo State following the death of his parents. The boy, identified as Kasarachi Odurukwe, was a primary six pupil before his death. He committed suicide by hanging himself on a rope on an Indian bamboo tree, it was gathered. According to village sources, the boy and two younger siblings had lost his parents and had been living with their aunty in that village. It was gathered that the deceased had been complaining of how boring the world had been to him since his parents passed away. One of the villagers said the boy would “jokingly tell his mates that he wanted to die and meet his mother in heaven”. It was gathered that Kasarachi, last Wednesday, led his two siblings and two other kids to a nearby stream to fetch water. On arrival at the stream, Kasarachi was said to have assisted the other children to fill their cans while he used a long stick to check the depth of the stream. One of the sources told The Nation, “Not satisfied with the shallow depth of the water, the boy took a rope and tied it to a bamboo tree. But his first and second attempts to kill himself failed while the other kids were begging him to stop. “It was on the third attempt on a stronger Indian bamboo tree that the rope strangled him. “That action jolted the other kids, who ran back to the village to report the incident to the family and villagers elders”. When the elders quickly got to the scene, they called in the police who assisted in bringing down the hanging body and deposited it at the morgue. It was further gathered that one of the things found on the deceased were four batteries, which some villagers said he might have intended to drink as poison.
