 A Federal High Court in Lagos yesterday remanded in Correctional Services custody an Indian and two Nigerians, who allegedly forged Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) receipts. Justice Saliu Saidu made the order following their arraignment on a three-count charge of forgery. The defendants are: Omkar Shinde, Chucks Okeke and Shittu Adedeji and a firm, Everchem Paints. A Senior State Counsel, Olofindare Adeleke told the judge that Okeke, Shinde and Everchem Paints, forged 15 SON receipts on February 12, 2020 at Close 6, House 4 Satellite Town, Lagos, and at 110/114 Oshodi-Apapa Expressway, Isolo. Adeleke alleged that the defendants committed the offence “with Intent to use the false documents as genuine”. The court heard that that Okeke and Shinde forged receipts numbered: TCI/S621 of 17/10/2016; TCI/5523 (16/11/2016), TC1/5524 (16/11/2016), TCI/1008 (12/04/2018), TCI/1366 (21/06/2018), TCI/268 (22/02/2018), TCI/1161 (10/05/2018), TCI/ 1008 (04/04/2018) and TCI/SS40 (13/01/2017).

The prosecution said it was with the “intention of causing the forged documents to be believed to have been issued by SON and use same as genuine.” The defendants, said Adedeji, on February 12 at 2, Morebise Egan, Igando, “did present false documents to SON officials, which they knew or had reason to know same to be false with intent to use the false documents as genuine”. According to him, the alleged offence was contrary to Section 465 and punishable under sections 467 and 516 of the Criminal Code Act, 2004. Each defendant pleaded not guilty. Their counsel, E.O Pobeni (for the first defendant), Tiwalade Aderoju (for the second and fourth defendants) and I. C. Ituma (for third defendant) informed the court that they had filed separate bail applications on behalf of their clients. Responding, the prosecutor applied for time to respond to the bail applications. Granting the prosecutor’s prayer, Justice Saidu remanded the trio at the Ikoyi Correctional Service centre and adjourned until March 4 for hearing of the applications.
