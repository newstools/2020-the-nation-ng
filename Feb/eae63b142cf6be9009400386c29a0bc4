Ekiti State Government has promoted over 4,000 teachers in the public primary schools. The Executive Chairman of the State Universal Education Board (SUBEB), Prof. Francisca Aladejana, who made this known in a statement in Ado-Ekiti, said the elevation covered outstanding promotions of primary school teachers in the state up to 2019. Stressing that the exercise was consequent upon the approval of Governor Kayode Fayemi with the directive that all outstanding promotion exercise must be cleared, Prof. Aladejana reiterated the commitment of the present administration to the welfare of workers. She, however, said that the exercise was based on merit, adding that written examinations and oral interviews were conducted to determine the level of competence of the affected teachers. Congratulating the teachers on their promotion,  Aladejana stressed the importance of reciprocating government’s gesture by rededicating themselves to their duties.
