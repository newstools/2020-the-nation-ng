 THE high point of the public presentation of Prince Bayo Osiyemi’s book, The Charming Prince in Journalism and Politics, at the Sheraton Hotels in Lagos on February 4 was the launch of the book by a former Lagos State deputy governor, Otunba Femi Pedro. Pedro had stood in for National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu as the chief launcher of the book because the latter was “unavoidably absent.” With speakers having taken turns to admire the “boyish” looks of seventy-year-old Osiyemi at the event, Pedro also took some time to admire the author’s looks in spite of his advanced age. The former deputy governor then sent the gathering into rib-cracking laughter with his declaration that he had just found that he was much younger than the 65-year-old everyone thought he was. “I was going through some documents in my house recently, and I found one left by my father, showing that I am actually 40 years old; not 65,” he said. His comment threw the gathering into hysteria laughter, with some guests saying that no one wants to grow old, particularly when they are on the chummy side of life like Pedro.
