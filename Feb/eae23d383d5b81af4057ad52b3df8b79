 Permutations by analysts and die-hard fans alike crumbled like a pack of cards on Saturday as Watford took potential league winners Liverpool to the cleaners. The result came to many as a huge surprise and put an end to Liverpool’s winning streak. The rout started with Senegal import Sarr grabbing a brace within six minutes before Troy Deeney made it three to the delight of Watford fans and disappointment of Liverpool fans. Impressive Sarr was even on the verge of making it a hat-trick missing the target just before he was pulled out in the 82nd minute for Argentine Ignacio Pussetto
The victory is no doubt huge for Watford who beaten by Manchester United last weekend and thus look good to avoid relegation. Jurgen Klopp’s men were looking to extend their unbeaten run and continue to keep momentum going ahead of season-defining games in the Champions League and FA Cup to come but that of course failed to materialise on Saturday. Thus it will be safe to say Liverpool are no longer invincible this season after a heroic performance and sensational display from Watford. Jurgen Klopp has been gracious in defeat and congratulated the Watford players.
