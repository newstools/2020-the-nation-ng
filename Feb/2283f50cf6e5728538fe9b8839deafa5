The Federal Government has expressed its readiness to meet outstanding financial commitments to the various international organisations and bodies to which Nigeria belongs. Minister of State for Budget and National Planning, Prince Clem Ikanade Agba, stated this at a meeting in Abuja with the Country Representative of Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations in Nigeria, Mr Suffyan Koroma. Agba’s statement was a direct response to Mr Koroma’s request that Nigeria should settle its outstanding membership dues to the FAO. He directed the Department of International Cooperation in the ministry, which is responsible for coordinating the activities of international donor agencies, to produce a spreadsheet of Nigeria’s commitments to enable the government meet them. The minister called for better coordination between the department and the FAO together with other international donor agencies. Koroma had also briefed the minister on what he called “the seamless implementation of the policy on the European Union Commission-funded Food and Nutrition Security Impact, Resilience Sustainability and Transformation programme in Nigeria”.
