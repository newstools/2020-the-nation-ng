Chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Sir Marc Wabara has identified unity of purpose as the strongest element to deliver Abia State to the party in 2023. He said it would be difficult for any organisation to make meaningful progress when some of its members work at cross purposes. He urged the APC in Abia State to resist anti-progressive characters ranging from clannishness, greed to selfishness witnessed in the party during the last general elections. This, he said, will enable the party to upstage the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) that has not been people -oriented in its policies and programmes in the state. Speaking with journalists, Wabara pointed ouy the absence of unity of purpose affected the APC negatively during the 2019 election. He said there was an urgent need for the party leadership in the state to enthrone discipline to regain the confidence of many party faithfuls. He decried the fact that the PDP administration in Abia state has only succeeded in weakening its civil service and reducing workers to a people without hope for tomorrow. Wabara regretted the slow pace of development in the state, pointing out that if internally revenue generating structures were put in place, the state would be in a very good position to deliver the dividends of democracy to its citizens.
