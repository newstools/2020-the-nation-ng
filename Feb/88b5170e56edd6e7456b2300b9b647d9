 UNITED Bank for Africa (UBA) Plc has revamped its NextGen account, which targets students in tertiary institutions and members of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), with more benefits. NextGen is a suit of personal accounts designed to meet the needs of young persons, grooming and growing with them from teenage  to adulthood. The bank takes up an additional role of mentoring these young ones as well as assist with tips towards guiding their future. The benefits would confer premium services to the young account holders. UBA, which operates in 20 African countries, introduced NextGen Account to encourage active savings among young people and teach them to manage their money effectively while enjoying world-class services that effectively suit their lifestyles. Ude Anele, Group Head, Retail Banking, UBA said the importance of inculcating in youths the culture of saving and being financially disciplined, cannot be overemphasised, hence the importance the bank places on the account. “The NextGen Account is our way of putting students in charge of their money so they can do more, especially at this critical stage of their lives with an account that comes free of fees,” Anele said. “The new NextGen Account opens students and NYSC members up to several benefits and opportunities, including multiple digital channels that makes banking just another fun thing to do on their mobile phones,” the Retail Banking head added. As a plus, the NextGen Account holders stand to win pocket money, complimentary invites to prime events and enjoy zero charge on all transactions. Group Head of Marketing Dupe Olusola, who also spoke about the revamped NextGen Account disclosed that NextGen, which the bank says is more than just an account, will partner with DRBLasGidi, a three-member group to ignite the interest of young people in the offering. “DRB LasGidi have proven to be culture shapers, pioneering the popular Alté (meaning alternative) movement, which promotes self-confidence and encourages young people to embrace their individuality,’’ he said.
