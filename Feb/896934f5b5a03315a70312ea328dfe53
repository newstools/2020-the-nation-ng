 A group in the Lagos State Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the Youth Movement for Solidarity and Justice, said yesterday that peace can only return to the chapter if Dr. Adegbola Dominic is allowed to complete his tenure as the chairman. The youth advised Adedeji Doherty, a factional state chairman of the party, to sheathe his sword in the interest of peace and stability so that the party can be a “serious opposition party in the state that is capable of winning future elections, especially the governorship election, which has been elusive since 1999”. While hailing Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State and other concerned stakeholders for their intervention, the group, in a statement by Oladimeji Balogun, said it is erroneous for the other camp to claim that Dominic was elected to serve in acting capacity for 90 days, following the defection of his predecessor, Moshood Salvador, to the All Progressives Congress (APC). He said: “A lot of us believe that one of the major problems confronting our dear party in Lagos State today is injustice and the inordinate ambition of some individuals who are desperate for positions and are averse to making sacrifices for the growth and development of the party. “On the lingering crisis in the Lagos State chapter of the PDP, we as concerned youths in the party are insisting that Dr. Adegbola Dominic remains the validly elected chairman of the party and he should be given a free hand to complete his tenure.”
