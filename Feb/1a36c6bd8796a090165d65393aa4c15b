Senators on Wednesday paid glowing tributes to one of their colleagues, the late Senator Benjamin Uwajumogu. Senate Leader Yahaya Abdullahi moved a motion that the lawmakers pay tributes to their late colleague. The motion was seconded by Minority Leader Enyinnaya Abaribe. This followed the arrival of the body of the late senator, which was laid in state at the foyer of the National Assembly. The late Uwajumogu, who died on December 18, 2019, represented Imo North. Senate President Ahmad Lawan said: “His loss is a loss to all of us. He gave a very good account of himself as a human being: calm, cool and calculated. “He has left but he has left something for us – humanity. There is nothing more important for us than working for Nigeria.” Senate Leader Abdullahi said: “The late Uwajumogu was a distinguished colleague who excelled in every facet of his senatorial duties, whether to his constituency or in his committee’s duties as well as his usually articulate contributions to Senate Debates. He was usually very articulate but quiet and reserved.” Minority Leader Eyinnaya Abaribe said: “We were all here; he sat over there. He walked into the tea room and we were even joking. “I joked between him and Senator Philips Tanimu Aduda to say whose stomach was bigger. But alas that is how the thing that we call life is. “An American writer, Earnest Hemmingway, said that every man’s life ends in the same way because it is death.” Many other senators expressed sadness at the demise of the Imo senator.
