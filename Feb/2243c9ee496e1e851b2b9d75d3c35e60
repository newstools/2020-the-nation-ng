The University of Benin (UNIBEN) has released its students on vacation following renovations of hostels by the Edo State Government due to the upcoming 2020 National Sports Festival. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that students will vacate on Feb. 20, one month before the 2020 National Sports Festival hosted by Edo State. Dr Benedicta Ehanire, the Public Relations Officer of UNIBEN disclosed this in an interview with NAN on Thursday in Benin. “Before the state government started the renovations, Prof. Lilian Salami, the Vice Chancellor of UNIBEN did some palliative measures. “She repaired street lights around hostels, grasses were cleared and there was steady water and power supply in the hostels. “She also carried out massive renovation of the classroom blocks and refurbishing of desks and chairs. “Thanks to the VC and the Edo state government for the good works,’’ she said. The PRO said the students vacated due to the upcoming 2020 National Sport Festival, which would start on March 20 to April 4. She advised students to make use of the opportunity by learning a skill before the institution resumed. (NAN)
