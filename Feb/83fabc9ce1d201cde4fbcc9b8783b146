Two Nigerian Karatekas, Rita Ogene – 68kg and Rustum Francis – 67kg, have qualified for Paris 2020 Olympic qualifier. Zainab Saleh, a member of the Federation of Nigeria and African Karate Federation (UFAK) Judges and Referees, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Lagos. She said that following the bronze medals won by the two Nigerians at the just concluded African Karate Federation (UFAK), they both qualified for the next Olympic Qualifier taking place in Paris between May 8 and May 10. NAN reports that Ronke Ogunsawo (50kg), Rita Ogene (68kg) female, while Rustum Francis 67kg and Henry Aghamoh 84kg male participated in the African Karate Championship tagged “Tangier 2020’’, held in Tangier, Morocco from Feb. 7 to Feb. 8. The championship was for 19 Senior, 11 Junior and 3rd cadet karate categories. Saleh, however, said that nothing would stop the nation’s Karatekas from qualifying for Tokyo 2020 Olympics Games if necessary preparations were carried out on time. “We have not been able to attend enough Continental and World Championships that will give us the opportunity to amass points required for qualification. “However, there is nothing stopping us from trying, as the qualifiers are meant to end in May 2020,” she said.
