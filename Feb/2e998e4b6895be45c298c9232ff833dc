Our Reporter A movie production outfit, Kingsway Music and Film Academy (KIMFA) has concluded plans to release a new epic movie, Ogoso ( king of the rock). Speaking on the new movie, the brains behind the production outfit, Pastor Folorunsho Adebayo Ajayi, who is the founder of Last Days Prayer Tabernacle Alagbado Lagos, said:“ We are into showbiz, music, entertainment, promotions and modeling . We are part of the delegates that travelled in conjunction with Performing Musician Employers Association of Nigeria (PMAN) to a world music festival in Cannes, France in 1991. ”I started the outfit as Ajayi Productions until when I received the calling to become a clergyman, and it metamorphosed into KIMFA in order to reach the world for Christ through music and film productions.  In 1994, we produced the first album of winner’s choir at, Iyana Ipaja, entitled “Sing His Praise” but this coming film “Ogoso is our maiden deliverance Christian film” “Our aim and purposes is to reach out to foundational curses which majority of people are unknowingly battling with. For instance many people just bear without knowing the significance of the name(s) they bear, but this film explains many things to us there.” “Challenges are getting the act together, market is saturated with unprofessional, and professional, also we over shot our budget. Finance is another thing we faced; also we faced spiritual challenges in the course of the shooting. But in all our aim is to reach out to people because nearly everybody is possessed with one demon so the essence of the story is to go back to our foundations and tackle the spiritual problem.”
