 ACEESS Bank Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Herbert Onyewumbu Wigwe is among the speakers billed for the Harvesters’ Entrepreneurs Forum (HEF), which holds on tomorrow. Others are GMD, Interswitch Mitchell Elegbe; cofounder, PiggyWest, Odun Eweniyi and Pastor Bolaji Odun. According to the convener of the event, Idowu, who is the Lead Pastor, Harvester International Christian Centre, the event is the fourth in the series, entitled: Re-Imagining Africa’s path to prosperity through innovation would hold in four centres in Lagos. At a briefing yesterday, he said the speakers were chosen because they had demonstrated time-tested and valuable insights in their endeavours, thereby rewriting the African narrative. Idowu said: ‘’This platform was prompted by the concerns for bridging the entrepreneurship deficits that has continue to limit the unleashing of the true potential of the African continent’s opportunities hence the facilitation of civic engagements and social development initiatives like the HEF, which has been premised upon the urgent and crucial interventionist initiative primarily aimed at providing a platform for business and enterprise development as well as aimed at equipping entrepreneurs and people of similar inclinations with practical and hands on business knowledge to help them achieve and sustain business success.’’ He added: “We intend to bridge that knowledge gap by raising awareness as well as engage in conversations that will restore the dignity of sustainable wealth by pointing young people in our societies towards good modelling. By this I mean, canvassing for modelling of young people’s lives and success stories around successful models whose success stories can be traced to dignified labour as against glamorising questionable sources of wealth. This for us is the way to raise global role models and sustainable wealthy generations from the emerging African landscape.’’ Idowu announced that the church plans to launch a social initiative – the Harvesters Social Enterprise Award of US10,000 – to anyone who could initiate practical solutions to any of the myriad of social problems confronting the continent.
