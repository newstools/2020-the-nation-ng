Olalekan Okusan  Oyinlomo Quadre could not sustained her form that saw her claiming the ITF Junior Grade 3 title in Pretoria last week as she has to settle for an early exit in the singles of the ITF/CAT African Closed Junior Championships 18 & Under. But she had to compensate for her singles exit with a smooth ride into the semifinal of the doubles event. As the number three seed in the girls’ singles, Quadre underestimated her opponent – South Africa’s Delien Kleinhans to her own peril. Having won the first set easily by 6-1, the Nigerian teenager allowed her opponent to fight back in the second set at 7-6(5) to level the tie. And final set which was the deciding match started well for Quadre but several unforced errors became the Nigerian undoing as the home girl claimed a 6-4 win to cause the first upset of the competition against Quadre.  Awarew that her status was at stake in the competition, Quadre did not want to leave the tournament empty-handed as she decided to partner Cameroun’s Anna Lorie Lemongo Toumbou in the doubles and their pairing has remained unbeaten. They were seeded number two in the girls’ doubles and they have been living up to expectation from the first round to the semifinal stage. In their first round, they were pitched against the duo of Zimbabwe’s Chelsea Chakanyuka and Benin Republic’s Gloriana  Goreti Nahumhse and they wasted no time in dismissing their opponents at 6-0, 6-1. They also  overcame the pair of Algeria’s Ines Bekrar and Tunisia’s Wiem Boubaker 6-2, 7-5 to berth in the last four. In the semifinal, they will battle the number three- Egypt’s Maria Charl and Kenya’s Angella Okutoyi for a place in the final.
