Frank Ikpefan, Abuja The Federal Government will continue to improve the deteriorating infrastructural facilities in the country’s universities, President Muhammadu Buhari said on Saturday. According to the President, education would continue to be a high priority item in his government’s drive to transform the economy. Buhari stated these at the University of Abuja’s 24th convocation. His address was read by the Executive Secretary of the National Universities Commission, Prof Abubakar Rasheed. The President said that tertiary institutions needed to be with uninterrupted academic activities if they would achieve the overall objective of contributing to national growth and development. He said: “The Federal Government will continue to provide Nigerians’ equal and massive access to education at all levels such that they can fulfil their dream of participating in the nation’s socio-economic development and empowerment of our youths. “The task of overcoming the problems of the education sector is not a responsibility of government alone. It should emerge through a concerted effort of government, parents, stakeholders and the society. “The government will continue to improve the deteriorating infrastructural facilities in the universities, teacher development, and curriculum review in tandem with the needs of our society. “This is expected, in the long run, to address deficiencies in all the segments of our educational system. “The Minister of Education has since directed the NUC to initiate the process of reviewing the curriculum of universities which would, among other relevant activities, include provision for the minimum level of qualification for university teachers.” The Vice-Chancellor of the university, Prof Abdulrasheed Na’Allah, said the institution graduated 10,331 undergraduate and postgraduate students. He said 26 were awarded First Class and 866 Second Class Upper degrees.
