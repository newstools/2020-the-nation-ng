Rasaq Ibrahim, Ado-Ekiti The store section and offices at the Ekiti State headquarters of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) have been razed by fire. The incident, which started around 2:15pm on Saturday at the agencyâ€™s headquarters located at Olorunsogo area of Ado-Ekiti, the state capital, lasted for an hour before the quick response of residents and Ekiti State Fire Service. Items including unquantifiable bags of confisticated Indian hemps, chairs and other office equipment were lost to the disaster. When our correspondent visited the scene, there was a thick smoke and smell of the cannabis sativa oozing out to the public. Speaking with The Nation on condition of anonymity, one of the NDLEA officals said the cause of the fire was not yet known. He said though no life was lost but properties were destroyed in the incident. He added the inferno came as a dream as he was in the office with others when his senior colleague who was outside, raised the alarm that the building was on fire. He, however, commended the residents and men of the Ekiti State Fire Service for responding quickly to the distress call, which according to him, the inferno from escalating to other offices. Efforts by newsmen to find out the cause of the fire were rebuffed by the agency personnel as only the fire service men were allowed into the agency premise as the gate was jealously guided from the public glare. When contacted, the Command Public Relations Officer, Mr. Peter Njokwu, said he had not been briefed on the fire incident.
