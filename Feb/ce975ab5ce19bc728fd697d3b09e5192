 SOME commuters, who were stranded on the Badagry-Lagos Expressway, following the ban on motorcycles and tricycles on the highways, have urged the Lagos State Government to extend its palliative measures to them. They narrated their ordeals to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), after they had spent hours at bus stops, waiting for non-available vehicles to transport them to their destinations. The Lagos State Government on February 1 began the enforcement of the Extant Transport Sector Reform Law 2018. The law banned the operation of motorcycles, popularly called Okada and tricycles (Keke) in some local governments and local council development areas (LCDAs). The NAN correspondent, who monitored the situation, reports that commuters waited endlessly for buses and cars to take them to their destinations. Some of the bus stops visited were: Badagry Roundabout, Ibereko, Mowo, Agemowo, MTN, Oko-Afo, Morogbo, Pipeline, Ibiye, Ajibade and Agbara. Security agencies comprising the Police, Anti-Robbery Squad, Lagos State Neighborhood Safety Corps and officers of the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority were on ground at most of the bus stops visited. A commuter at Aradagun bus stop, Mr. Joseph Avoseh, urged the government to assign some of its BRT buses to the route to alleviate the sufferings of residents. “Things are really difficult for us here; we don’t have good roads, our hopes of getting Okada and ‘Keke’ to transport us have been dashed, and still we need to get to our places of work daily.
