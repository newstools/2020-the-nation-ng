Three persons died and many were injured in the attack. A statement by the governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Mrs. Mary Berje, said Bello visited the victims at the IBB Specialist Hospital, Minna. The governor Bello commiserated with bereaved families and prayed God to give them the fortitude to bear the loss. He hinted that the state and Federal Governments are working to end the carnage. The governor directed the State Emergency Management Agency (NSEMA) to provide succour to affected communities. The governor, who said strategic measures were being taken to curb the activities of bandits, urged the people to assist security agencies with valuable information about bandits and their informants. Chairman of Shiroro council Suleiman Chukuba said the bandits killed three persons and injured 50 others. He added that over 300 cattle were also rustled. According to Chukuba, the bandits invaded the community on about 100 motorcycles and shot sporadically to announce their presence. “I can’t ascertain their actual number but my people said they came on about 100 motorcycles, three on each motorcycle,” he said.
