Our Reporter Media specialist,  Instinct Wave, is set to hold the third Africa Human Resources Innovation Awards (AHRIA). The awards, which was Ghana Human Resources Innovation Awards, was rebranded to Africa Human Resource Innovation Awards to cover the sub-region and bring together great minds across Africa. According to the organisers, the event will take place at Movenpick Ambassador Hotel in Accra, Ghana on  March 27. “AHRIA in its third year will honour leading HR Professionals, organisations with top notch HR models and practices and executives who have made sterling contributions to the corporate sector over the years. AHRIA will also unveil Top 50 HR Leaders across verticals in the sub region,” the organisers said. InstinctWave CEO, Mr. Akin Naphtal said this year is indeed shaping up to be a truly generation-defining across the spectrum – from politics, to science, to the business world and beyond.  Indeed the year heralds a new focus for business leaders. “As Africa’s premium B2B event & media specialist, we are expanding some of our award schemes to cover the sub region as well as catch up with the new wave in the business sector. This is the reason behind the rebranding of the awards scheme to AHRIA. “We are also glad to have the Fair Wages Commission on Board as a partner and a jury of AHRIA 2020.” Naphtal said AHRIA 2020 is in partnership with the Ghana’s Fair Wages and Salaries Commission, a reputable government institution.
