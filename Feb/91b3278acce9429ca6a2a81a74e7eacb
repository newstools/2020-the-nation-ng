 The Ondo State Police Command on Wednesday urged residents of Akure to disregard any rumour of Bank Robbery or attempted Bank Robbery in the state capital or anywhere in the state. The clarification became imperative following a rumour being circulated on the social media that some banks were being robbed in Akure,the state capital. The information spread like a wildfire and created panic in the state capital,while many residents especially buyers and sellers at Oja-Oba area ran helter skelter. Many abandoned their goods and ran for safety. Police spokesman, Femi Joseph,a Chief Superintendent of Police(CSP)said the story is not only false and mischievous but also wicked and lacks substance. He said, “we wish to inform the general public especially the Citizens of the State to disregard any rumour of Bank Robbery or attempted Bank Robbery in Akure or anywhere in the state. “We make bold to say that the story is not only false and mischievous but also wicked and lacks substance as no such incident happened anywhere in the State. ” We urge the good People of the State to disregard this rumour, as it is nothing but a blatant lie from the pit of hell. Our men are everywhere across the State to deal with any manner of crime or criminality”.
