By Tunde Liadi, Owerri  Reports emanating from England indicate that Leicester City forward, Kelechi Iheanacho is to get another chance to impress the Super Eagles’ technical crew in the forthcoming double-header 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers between Nigeria and the Leone Stars of Sierra Leone slated for March 27th and 31st at the Stephen Keshi Stadium, Asaba and Siaka Stevens Stadium, Freetown. Iheanacho fell out of favour with the Eagles’ technical crew headed by Gernot Rohr after his indifferent showing for Leicester City and the Nigerian team that cost him a place in the 2019 AFCON in Egypt. He was also close to leaving his English club in the January transfer window before his form improved remarkably. The striker has scored seven goals from the 13 games in all competitions for the Foxes including three goals in nine matches for the 2015-16 EPL Champions in the league and this has not gone unnoticed by Rohr who has invited him ahead of preparations for the two games next month. A source stated that the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has already begun dispatching invitation letters to those that would prosecute the two games and that Iheanacho’s letter had already been received by Leicester City. Iheanacho last played for the Eagles on November 20, 2018 in the Eagles’ friendly game with the Cranes of Uganda.
