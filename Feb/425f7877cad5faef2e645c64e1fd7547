 LAGOS State Government said it shut down 309 health facilities in 2019 for non-compliance to stipulated medical standards. The Executive Secretary, Health Facility Monitoring and Accreditation Agency (HEFAMAA), Dr. Abiola Idowu, disclosed this yesterday in a statement in Lagos. She, however, noted that some of the health facilities had been reopened, adding that they had corrected the infractions and pledged to abide by set standards. Idowu said that the agency in January closed 20 health facilities for lack of compliance with regulatory standards. She said the government remains committed to sustaining the fight against the engagement of unqualified personnel in health facilities. According to her, the government will continue to insist on suitable environment for the dispensation of medical care for promotion and maintenance of good health. She warned that the government would not tolerate any form of illegal health practices and urged all health facility operators across the state to abide by the standards of HEFAMAA, to avoid sanction. “Health security is an integral part of public security, which is the primary duty of the government. “The state government is responsible and responsive and will not shy away in its efforts to ensure the health and well-being of the people,” Idowu said. According to her, HEFAMAA is poised to become a health regulatory agency that will promote quality health care delivery to Lagosians. She said that the agency would do this by enhancing its capacity to carry out accreditation and effective quality assurance monitoring of all health facilities, increase public awareness and collaboration with critical stakeholders. Idowu advised new operators to register with the agency, saying that existing registered operators should ensure prompt renewal of their certificate to avoid being sanctioned. She urged the public to support the government in its fight against quackery and illegal operation of health facilities by reporting people behind such acts to relevant government agencies, to safeguard the health and well-being of the citizens. Idowu restated government’s commitment to the fulfilment of accessible, affordable and quality health care to the residents.
