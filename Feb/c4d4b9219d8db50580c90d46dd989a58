Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, has tasked the Team Nigeria to focus on making the country proud  as  the Abuja 2020 Para-Powerlifting World Cup kicks off today. Dare urged the athletes  to avoid all distractions during his visit to their camp at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium in Abuja , adding the ministry is committed to their welfare. He however, took the time to explain the Ministry’s ‘Adopt-an-Athelete’ programme, which he said is designed to connect individual athletes to corporate institutions and private individuals for sponsorship of the athletes’ training. He said: “Once the link is done, you will be connected to the person or company and the money comes directly to you. It doesn’t come to the Ministry or anyone else. “The Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports has a responsibility to you and no Federation or President of any Federation is bigger than the Ministry. “The Ministry takes the lead and that has been the rule. I am not going to change it. The Ministry is the government and we have your best interest at heart. No matter whatever else is happening, ultimately the Ministry is responsible for you.” He commended the athletes for their service and sacrifice, promising improved welfare ahead of the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games. He said: “For the first time, we are directly supporting and working on the welfare of the athletes because they are the most important. “ If I have to reduce the team that will travel from the Ministry to get extra money to support the athletes, I will do it because you are the most important stakeholders. “ So, keep your eyes on the goal. Whatever happens, let us on this side deal with it.” Paralympic Games gold medallists – Yakubu Adesokan and Obiji loveline top the list of athletes for the tournament with Nigeria competing in the senior and junior events of the championship.
