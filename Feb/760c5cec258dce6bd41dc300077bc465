By Collins Nweze The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has committed 18 million Chinese Yuan  to Renminbi-denominated Letters of Credit needed by importers. The fund went through the spot and short-tenored forwards segment of the inter-bank foreign exchange market. The apex bank also injected $218.41 million into the retail Secondary Market Intervention Sales (SMIS), which is in continuation of its intervention in the inter-bank foreign exchange market. CBN’s Director, Corporate Communications Department, Isaac Okorafor said the interventions, like in previous exercises, were for requests in the agricultural and raw materials sectors. He further expressed satisfaction over the stability of the foreign exchange which, according to him, was largely due to sustained intervention by the Bank. He assured that the CBN Management would remain committed to ensuring that all the sectors of the forex market continue to enjoy access to the needed foreign exchange, stressing that the stability in the foreign exchange market continued to attract investors . It will be recalled that the bank last Tuesday offered authorised dealers in the wholesale segment of the market the sum of $100 million, while the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and the invisibles segments each received the sum of $55 million.  Meanwhile, $1 exchanged for N358 at the Bureau de Change (BDC) segment of the foreign exchange market, while Chinese Yuan  exchanged at N46 on Friday. According to Afrinvest report, across the forex market, the naira remained stable. At the official window, the local currency strengthened five kobo week-on-week to close at N306.95/$1. At the parallel market however, Naira traded flat all week at N360.00/$1.00. Conversely, Naira depreciated 40 kobo week-on-week to N364.97/$1 at the Investors’ & Exporters’ window.
