Our Reporter THE investigation into a deadly gun attack in Hanau is focusing on whether others knew about or helped organise it, Germany’s federal prosecutor Peter Frank said. The suspect shot dead nine people “of migrant background” at two shisha bars on Wednesday evening. He and his mother were later found dead in his flat. Frank said material the suspect Tobias R had posted online showed a “deeply racist mindset”. He had also been influenced by conspiracy theories, Frank said. Earlier, Chancellor Angela Merkel said there were many signs Tobias R, 43, had acted out of racism. Speaking in Berlin, Mrs. Merkel said: “Racism is a poison. Hate is a poison and this poison exists in our society and is already to blame for many crimes.” Turkey said at least five of the dead were Turkish citizens. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he expected Germany to “throw light on all aspects” of the attack. Nazi salutes, banned swastika emblems and even the playing of the Horst Wessel, the one-time Nazi “anthem” – all have been cropping up in far-right extremist circles as Germany struggles to contain a growing wave of home-grown extremism. The problem has been particularly acute in – but not confined to – the east of the country, in the former East Germany. There, unemployment levels have been higher than in the rest of Germany and a simmering resentment, by some, of the recent immigrant arrivals has manifested itself in arson attacks on hostels. Frank said six people had also been injured in the attack, one of them seriously. Shortly after the attacks, the suspect and his 72-year-old mother were found in his apartment, both also shot. A gun was found next to the suspect’s body. Frank said investigators wanted to establish any links the suspect may have had in Germany or potentially also abroad.
