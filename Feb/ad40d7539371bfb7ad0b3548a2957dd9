Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu yesterday appealed to the Federal Government to ensure that the ongoing rehabilitation of Lagos-Badagry Expressway meets international standard. Sanwo-Olu spoke when he hosted members of the Senate Committee on Works, who visited him at the State House, Alausa Ikeja. They were led by Chairman of the committee, Senator Adamu Aliero. The governor, who explained that the state government was working on a 10-lane road from Lagos State University (LASU) to Okokomaiko corridor, believed that the Ministry of Works should also replicate same from Agbara to Seme border. He said since the road is an international gateway, constructing two lanes will not meet the standard required. The governor said: “First is to thank Mr. President for giving the support at the budgetary level through the Ministry of Works. More importantly to thank the committee for the oversight function to Lagos.” He said that since Lagos used to be the former capital, “it has inherited both Federal Government assets and liabilities. We have to manage the assets, which is a huge responsibility.”
