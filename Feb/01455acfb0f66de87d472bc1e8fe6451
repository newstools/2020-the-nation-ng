The leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu was unavoidably absent in the February 14 burial ceremony of his parents; HRH Eze Israel Okwu Kanu and Ugoeze Sally Kanu. The burial held at Isiama Afaraukwu community in Umuahia North LGA of Abia State attracted the presence of the Senate Miniority leader, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe, Senator Victor Umeh, former National Chairman of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), former Anambra State  and Atiku Abubakar’s vice Presidential candidate in the 2019 election, His Excellency Peter Obi, former Speaker Abia State House of Assembly and onetime Umuahia/Ikwuano federal House of Representatives member, Rt. Hon.  Stanley Ohajuruka, l Chief Tony Ukasoanya; Abia State PDP pioneer chairman, Chief Empire Kanu and among others. Recall that there were rumours about the  possibility of Nnamdi attending the burial of his parents as the first son according to the customs and traditions of the community, but the fear of being arrested by the security operatives after being declared wanted by the federal government may have prevented him from being present at the burial ceremony. Some IPOB members who spoke to our reporter said that they would have been happier if their leader was able to attend the parents burial. They were however happy that they made it to Isiama Afaraukwu community to pay their last respect to the parents of their leader even though he was unavoidably absent from the event. Kanu’s brothers; Prince Emmanuel and Kanuta stood in the gap for Nnamdi at the ceremony. The event attracted IPOB members and IPOB sympathizers from different parts of the country and the world. Unlike the tension associated with the ceremony, there was no presence of military personnel around the Isiama Afaraukwu community, though there was deployment of Police personnel at different entrance and exit routes of the community in an apparent move to forestall any breakdown of law and order.
