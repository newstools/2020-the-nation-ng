The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) and the League Management Committee (LMC) have resolved to make the league better despite some hiccups experienced in the first stanza of the ongoing season. In a mid-season review held yesterday at the LMC’s head office in Abuja, both bodies resolved to deploy addition security officers at match venues, create volunteer stewards corps, ban unruly challenge of match officials by players and sustain review of match officials’ performance. NFF President, Amaju Pinnick explained that the meeting was called to discuss the progress made so far in the NPFL and to explore possible strategies that can be adopted to sustain the progress and eliminate identified setbacks such as the unwarranted security breach that occurred in the Abia Derby and the breach of public peace within in Katsina metropolis after the derby match between Katsina United and Kano Pillars He reiterated that “all parties must work together to ensure that such incidents do not occur again and we must keep our match venues safe at all times to provide fans a conducive environment to enjoy games.” The LMC Chairman, Shehu Dikko stated that the ongoing season could be described as the most competitive and successful given the results, performance of match officials and the overall conduct of fans. Dikko said, “We have so far played 193 games this season with over 1,544,000 fans attending games. There has been just one incident of breach of security on the pitch and that was the incident in Umuahia last Sunday. The other incidents in Lafia and Katsina were outside the pitch and after the successful conclusions of the game. “Though no security breaches and threat to public order should be tolerated and associated with the beautiful game, it’s noted that all three incidents had to do with local rivalries between clubs that share geographical proximity and have had running supremacy claims by their fans, Dikko noted.
