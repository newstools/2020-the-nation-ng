From Emma Elekwa  Dean of Students Affairs of the Nnamdi Azikiwe University (UNIZIK), Awka Anambra State, Prof Chinonso Achebe, has ascribed the declining cultism and other vices in the institution to the academic reforms introduced by the management. Speaking during the orientation  for the fresh students of the institution, Achebe linked the decrease in the menace to the institution’s stable academic calendar. According to him, students have been fully engaged in academic exercises that they barely have time for mundane activities. He said: “Cultism is at its lowest ebb quite unlike what it used to be in the past years. We’ve not had infighting and other vices among the students in recent times. Besides, the university has enjoyed a stable academic calendar which has contributed largely to the students’commitment to their studies.  “Lapses in academic system allow unwanted anti-social activities to breed. But if the students are engaged academically, it will be difficult for them to have time for mundane activities. Before now, students could abscond from lectures all through the semester and barge into examination halls; but with the strict adherence to 75 per cent attendance, such cases are no longer obtainable.” The dean, however, urged the students to reciprocate the university’s commitment to their security and welfare by taking their studies seriously and shunning vices. He challenged them to key into the management’s vision of ensuring that the university ranks among the top 200 in the world.
