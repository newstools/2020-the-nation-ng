It is no longer news that the immediate past President of the Senate, Dr. Bukola Saraki, is still under investigation by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). But if Saraki has any headache, it is about EFCC’s application before a Federal High Court in Lagos seeking permanent forfeiture of his choice assets in Lagos and Ilorin. If the assets are permanently forfeited, the ex-Senate President might soon be homeless. And ahead of the continuation of the hearing of the forfeiture application on April 17, the  EFCC may release more damning fact – sheet on Saraki. But the two-term Governor of Kwara State said he was not shaken. He challenged the EFCC to present concrete evidence on why he should lose the properties. He said he has nothing to fear. He said: “We hereby assure the associates and supporters of Dr. Saraki that he remains unflinching in his belief in the ability of the Nigerian judiciary to always do justice to all persons and at all times. We believe that justice shall prevail in this case, as well.” Nigerians are watching who will blink first between the EFCC and Saraki.
