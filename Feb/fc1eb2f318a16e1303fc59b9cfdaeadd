Nigeria’s D’Tigress expressed their willingness to be part of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games after blowing away their Mozambique counterpart 85-51 on Thursday in their first group match of the FIBA Women’s Olympic Qualifying Tournament, which tipped off in Belgrade. The Mozambicans were the quicker off the block as they pinned the Nigerian backwards to win the first quarter 19-18 despite the spirited effort of the D’Tigress. However, at the resumption of the second quarter, the Nigerian team with seasoned campaigners seized the initiative from the Mozambicans as the D’Tigress won the last three quarters 23-9, 25-13, 19-10 for a cumulative score of 85-51. The bravery of Mozambique’s inspirational captain Leia Dongue, who led the floor with 16 points, was not enough to save the South Africans, who shocked Senegal to book a place in the OQT. France-based Promise Amukamara led the Nigerian team with 14 points to inspire the D’Tigress to victory. She had a strong impact off the bench hitting Nigeria’s only triple of the first half, just before the buzzer, as part of a 14-point contribution, whilst rounding out her display with 5 rebounds, 5 steals and 3 assists. Nigeria next game will be against host Serbia tomorrow as the group also has world champions, United States.
