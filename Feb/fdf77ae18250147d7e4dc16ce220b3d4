 ONE person has been confirmed killed while several houses were burnt over a land dispute in Jos North Local Government Area of Plateau State. Parties to the land dispute include the University of Jos and some residents on a piece of land located in Naraguta village near the permanent site of the University of Jos. The Nation learnt that a notice was issued to those residing on the land to vacate and hand it over to the university. The university has been appealing to residents of the disputed land to quit. The Nation learnt that instead of quiting the land, the residents protested the university’s claim. In the course of the protest, violence erupted, leading to burning of houses around the community. Several cars, churches and residential houses razed. Police spokesman ASP Ubah Gabriel, who confirmed the incident to newsmen, said one person was killed and four houses burnt. He said that investigation was ongoing to bring the perpetrators to book. However, the Leadership of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in Jos North  claimed that all the houses razed belonged to Christians  residing in the community. A press statement issued on Saturday evening in Jos by Rev. Canon Nenman Isa Gowon said the violence had nothing to do with religion, but that the action of the protesters took religious dimension when Christian homes and churches became targets of attack by the protesters. “We are again being attacked in Jos North. These people came around 11:30am today, 22-02-2020 and burnt down at least 10 Christian houses in Naraguta villages, a village settlement dominated by Christians. They burnt down a church and some cars.” “ We want to make it clear to the government and security agents that while we continue to obey law and order, we call on them to bring these none persons to book” One person was said to be killed while another cut with machetes by a mob was receiving treatment at a hospital.
