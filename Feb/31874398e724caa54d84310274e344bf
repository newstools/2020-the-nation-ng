 SUPER Eagles Alex Iwobi was on the pitch for an hour in Everton’s 2-3 loss to Arsenal in a thrilling Premier League game at the Emirates on Sunday. The former Arsenal forward came off for Bernard in the 60th minute in a game that saw Bukayo Saka, who replaced the injured Sead Kolasinac on 19 minutes, provide the assist for Arsenal’s equaliser, sending in a superb cross for Eddie Nketiah to slot home eight minutes later. It was Saka’s 10th assist in all competitions this season, most of any current teenage Premier League player. Everton got off to the perfect start in the first minute with Dominic Calvert-Lewin, taking advantage of a slack defending from the Arsenal backline from set piece to acrobatically slam the ball home. After Nketiah’s equaliser Arsenal went 2-1 up on 33 minutes through Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang who ran on to David Luiz’s pass and neatly place his effort into the far corner. But in the fourth minute of first half added time, Richarlison scored to end the half 2-2 from another set piece. However, 24 seconds into the restart Aubameyang got his second and Arsenal’s third with a superb header from Nicolas Pepe’s cross. Arsenal have now stretched their unbeaten Premier League  run to seven games and are yet to lose in 2020. Also, they are now unbeaten in their last 24 home Premier League games against Everton (W20, D4) since a 2-1 defeat in January 1996 at Highbury under Bruce Rioch. The win takes them to ninth on 37 points and seven points away from fourth position in the league table.
