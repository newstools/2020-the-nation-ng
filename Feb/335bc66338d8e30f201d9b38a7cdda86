 Toyota Motor Engineering & Manufacturing is recalling 44,191 model year 2020 Toyota Avalon Hybrids, Camrys, Camry Hybrids & Lexus ES300h vehicles, and model year 2019-2020 RAV4s and RAV4 Hybrids equipped with 2.5L 4-Cylinder engines. Porosity in the engine castings may result in cracks than can allow coolant to leak internally and/or externally. A coolant leak can cause the engine to overheat and cause a vehicle stall in conventional gasoline vehicles, increasing the risk of a crash. Additionally, for all involved vehicles, the engine may suffer damage mechanically, possibly resulting in an engine oil leak, increasing the risk of a fire. Toyota will notify owners, and dealers will inspect and replace the engine including the engine block – as necessary – free of charge. The recall is expected to begin April 6. Tesla recently announced plans to recall 15,000 of the company’s Model X SUVs. The recall stems from an issue with “excessive corrosion” of bolts that connect power steering components to the steering gear. The issue has been more prominent in areas where road salt is used to combat snow and ice. The issue could result in a vehicle losing its power-steering-assist function, which would make it more difficult to turn the steering wheel, but not make the vehicle undriveable.  The electric vehicle maker issued a similar recall on Model S sedans in 2018. The Model X carries a starting sticker price of just under $85,000, a range of 328 miles between charges, and a top speed of 155 mph.
