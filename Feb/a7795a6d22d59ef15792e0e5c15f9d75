 Nigerian equities closed weekend with net loss of N190.8 billion as weak domestic sentiment and global risk concerns sustained continued depreciation in share prices in Nigeria and other global stock markets. Benchmark indices at the Nigerian equities market indicated average decline of 1.32 per cent at the weekend, equivalent to net capital depreciation of N190.8 billion for the immediate past week. The continuing price depreciation depressed the average year-to-date return for Nigerian equities to 2.04 per cent. Despite the onset of the aggressive period of the earnings season, investors in Nigerian equities remained cautious and bargain-hunters were overwhelmed by discounted open market orders by divesting investors seeking to attract deals in a supply-driven buyer’s market. Nigeria’s second largest financial institution, Zenith Bank International, released its audited results at the weekend with net profit of N208.8 billion and final dividend per share of N2.80. The final dividend represents a dividend yield of 14.1 per cent on the bank’s closing price of N19.85 per share at the weekend. United Capital also announced a dividend per share of 50 kobo, a dividend yield of 14.5 per cent on the investment banking group’s closing price of N3.45 per share at the weekend. Most market analysts remained cautious about the outlook for the Nigerian market in spite of expectations that immediate returns, in terms of dividend yields, may significantly overwhelm nominal saving rates and average yield in the fixed-income market. “Following four weeks of consecutive losses, we expect to see some bargain hunting in early trades next week. However, we maintain a bearish outlook in the near term as overall investor sentiment remains weak,” Afrinvest Securities, a major stockbroking firm, stated at the weekend. Analysts at Cordros Securities advised investors to trade cautiously and take positions only in “fundamentally justified stocks” citing the continued weak market sentiments. The All Share Index (ASI)-the value-based common index that tracks all share prices at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), closed weekend at 27,388.62 points as against its week’s opening index of 27,755.87 points. Aggregate market value of all quoted equities also declined from its week’s opening value of N14.456 trillion to close weekend at N14.268 trillion. The difference between the ASI and market value was due to the additional listing of shares by AIICO Insurance Plc.
