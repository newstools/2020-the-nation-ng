  POLICEMEN attached to the Assistant Inspector General of Police (AIG) Zone II, Onikan on Monday shot a man while attempting to disperse a mob at Magodo in Isheri-Olowora, Lagos. The incident occurred around 5pm, when the policemen went to the area to enforce a court order. It was gathered that the team met resistance from youths in the area who claimed that they were working with some influential people to chase them out. The Nation on Monday reported several appeals to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu by Gateway Zone Estate Community Development Association (CDA) to stop alleged plot by vested interests to build homes on the green belt. Residents who took to the social media to send Save-Our-Souls messages to security agencies about the fight said Area Boys went berserk as sounds of gunshots rented the air. They said that the miscreants also vandalised vehicles as people scampered to safety. Some claimed the fight started after the policemen shot a man on the hand, adding that the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) and Isheri Division intervened before calm was restored. “Isheri-Olowora community near Magodo is boiling. Omo oniles are fighting seriously and gunshots are booming everywhere. “The fight started when policemen who were sent to enforce court order on buildings shot a man which angered boys in the area,” said a source. When contacted, spokesperson for Zone II DSP Hauwa Idris-Adamu said she was not aware of the incident.
