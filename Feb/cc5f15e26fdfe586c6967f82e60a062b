Eddie Hearn has insisted that the winner of the rematch between Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder cannot avoid a unification fight with Anthony Joshua. Wilder, 34, defends his WBC world title against Fury, 31, for the second time in Las Vegas on February 22 after the pair fought for a controversial draw in December 2018. Joshua, who reclaimed his WBA, WBO and IBF straps with victory over Andy Ruiz Jr in December, has his sights set on a clash with the victor as he looks to complete the collection and become undisputed heavyweight champion. The 30-year-old’s promoter Hearn believes that a fight with the Bronze Bomber or Gypsy King must happen and repeated his assertions that he is prepared to offer an equal purse split to make it happen after seeing earlier offers rejected. The Matchroom boss told TalkSPORT: “For once I agree with my esteemed colleague [Frank] Mr Warren, the winner has to fight Anthony Joshua, there’s no doubt about it. “Fury is talking a brilliant game for this fight and he’s an excellent self-promoter. The fact is, we have made offers to Fury and Wilder of 60/40 way before they were as relevant as they are now and they both turned it down. “So we have been actively trying to make this fight, we’ve been round the houses, it’s been talked about for ages.” “60-40 to both and they wanted 50/50. Like I said in an interview the other day, maybe we will have to make that offer next but there’s no point talking about a deal until that fight is over – but when that fight is over we have got to get it made.”
