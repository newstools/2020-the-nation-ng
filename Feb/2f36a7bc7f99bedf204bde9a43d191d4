There are indications that Nigeria’s participation in the World Taekwondo (WT) African Olympic Qualification Tournament holding this weekend in Morocco may be in doubt over paucity of funds. NationSport learnt on Sunday that the team is expected to depart the country on Tuesday for the tournament but feelers from the Ministry of Youth and Sports showed that lack of fund may prevent the team from making the trip to Rabat, Morocco. Already, the Nigeria Taekwondo Federation (NTF) had secured visa for the participating athletes and officials as the team is still awaiting the nod from the Sports Ministry to be certain of being part of the qualifiers later this week. Meanwhile, the athletes that will represent Nigeria at the qualifiers will be made known later this week as over 20 athletes are at present shaping up in Abuja for the qualifiers as Nigeria is aiming to return to the Olympic Games after its last appearance at London 2012. Following the successful campaign at the Fujairah Open held in Dubai last month, where Elizabeth Anayancho and Benjamin Okuomose picked up bronze medals for Nigeria, the Minister of Youth and Sports, Sunday Dare has assured the team of his support. The African Qualification Tournament for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics for the Taekwondo event will be taking place 20 – 24 February 2020 in Rabat, Morocco. The finalists in each weight category will secure their places at Tokyo 2020.
