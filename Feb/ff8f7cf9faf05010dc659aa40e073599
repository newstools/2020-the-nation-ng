Borno Governor Babagana Umara Zulum has met with over 120,000 refuges in Niger Republic displaced by Boko Haram insurgency. The refugees, who consist of men, women and children fled from different communities from the northern part of the State, trekked to neighbouring Niger at the heat of the crisis in 2014. Zulum’s spokesman, Malam Isa Gusa, said the Governor’s idea of visiting the refuges in Niger was to see to their dignified repatriation back to Nigeria and Borno State in particular and resettle them in their various communities. The statement recalled that about three weeks ago, Zulum had hosted a high level meeting in Abuja, which had in attendance officials from Nigeria’s Federal ministries of Foreign Affairs, Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development; the National Commission for Refugees, Migrants and internally displaced persons and the National Emergency Management Agency to discuss repatriation of Borno citizens from Cameroon, Niger and Chad Zulum travelled to Bosso, Garin Wanzam and Tumur, all in Diffa province, to meet the refugees. Host Governor of Diffa, Isa Lameen led Zulum during the visits. Borno Speaker,  Abdulkarim Lawan, who is from northern parts of Borno state, was also part of the trip. Zulum travelled to Diffa from Malam-Fatori, headquarters of Abadam local government in Northern Borno, which had been a stronghold of Boko Haram insurgents until it was recently regained by the military. The visit to Malam-Fatori, the first time in more than five years by a civilian, happened the same Saturday the Governor entered Diffa province in Niger Republic. Zulum, while addressing top officials, expressed his gratitude to government of Diffa province, the Federal Government of Niger and the host communities for being hospitable to Borno citizens. The Borno Governor was particularly thankful to his host, Mr Lameen of Diffa province, for his empathy and compassion towards Nigerian refugees from Borno.
