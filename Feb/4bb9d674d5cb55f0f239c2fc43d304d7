The Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ibrahim Pantami on Thursday urged Nigerians to direct their enquiries to the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) over the 7.5 per cent Value Added Tax (VAT) deductions on voice calls and text messages by telecom service providers. The minister, whose office is said to have been inundated with inquiries in relation to the deductions, said  the Ministry had no mandate to intervene on tax issues. A statement signed by his media aide, Uwa Suleiman, also explained that Pantani had no prior knowledge of the development. “The office of the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Ali Ibrahim (Pantami) has been inundated with complaints and enquiries concerning the recent 7.5 per cent VAT deductions on voice calls and text messages, by some Mobile Network Operators (MNOs). “While we appreciate the support and efforts of well-meaning Nigerians who have sought clarifications in a civil manner, we wish to inform the general public that the issues of VAT, do not fall under the Ministry’s purview. “All further enquiries and clarifications may henceforth be directed to the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), being the proper institution for tax matters,” the statement read.
