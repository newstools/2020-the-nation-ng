A recurrent thigh injury has delayed the eventual qualification of Aruna Quadri for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games after the Nigerian withdrew from the Qualifying Tournament holding in Tunis. However, Nigeria’s trio of Olufunke Oshonaike, Offiong Edem and Olajide Omotayo have secured their places at the multi-sports championship holding in Japan. Quadri had earlier beaten Togo’s Kokou Dodji Fanny 4-0 (11-7, 11-4, 11-7, 11-3) but he managed to finish the second match against Senegal’s Ibrahima Diaw but he fell 2-4 (7-11, 8-11, 8-11, 11-6, 13-11, 7-11). The tie was delayed for several minutes for the medical team to attend to the Nigerian who later opted out of the last group match against Tunisia’s Adam Hmam. With this development, Quadri will have to wait till May to book his place in Tokyo based on his world ranking. But it was Oshonaike that was the cynosure of all eyes after the 45-year-old made history as the first African female athlete to compete at seven Olympic Games after picking one of the four slots at stake in Tunis. Oshonaike defeated Algeria’s Lynda Loghraibi, Cameroun’s Sarah Hanffou and Mauritius’ Nandeshwaree Jalim to ascertain her spot in Tokyo. Edem like Oshonaike also maintained her 100 percent record after beating Ethiopia’s Gulti Marta, Tunisia’s Fadwa Garci and Abir Haj Salah. Omotayo was in fine form to book his place in Tokyo after topping Group Two with victories over Cote d’Ivoire’s Kizito Oba Oba and Algeria’s Larbi Bouriah while his last group tie against Tunisia’s Kerem Ben Yahia is a mere formality. Also, Senegal’s Ibrahima Diaw, Cameroun’s Sarah Hanffou, Tunisia’s Garci Fadwa and Adam Hmam joined the list of athletes that qualified from Tunis.
