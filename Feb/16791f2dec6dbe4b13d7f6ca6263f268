 THE Lagos State Government has assured citizens of its continuous financial and other forms of support to the Lagos Public Interest Law Partnership (LPIP), to enable it offer free judicial services to indigent Lagosians, who desire fair legal representation. Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu gave the assurance when a four-man team from the Board of Trustees of the organisation, led by Senator Daisy Danjuma, visited him at the Lagos House, Ikeja. The LPIP was established in 2012 to expand access to justice and reduce the burden on government funded agencies. The governor hailed the board for making things easy for Lagosians, who might not have the opportunity to be heard through the provision of free legal services. He thanked the team for its role in rendering services to humanity through partnership with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and lawyers, promising that the government would raise the bar to merge the users with operators in the delivery of access to justice and judicial services. “I want to commend the initiative, and for us as a government, we will continue to raise the bar. “This platform we are talking about is important. We need to merge users and operators so that people can see what requirements, areas and skills are required and they can merge them for their benefits. As the saying goes, justice must not just be seen, but must be done. “We’ll continue to support the partnership and collaborate in whatever form for a better society. The support may be financial or any other resources required for the LPIP to achieve its mandate,” Sanwo-Olu said. He urged other lawyers to support the organisation, noting that Lagosians deserved the best. Senator Danjuma had appreciated the support of the state government with regards to the digitisation of its services and the pro bono week, saying it was developed with the partnership of stakeholders to complement government’s efforts in the provision of free justice delivery service to the people.
