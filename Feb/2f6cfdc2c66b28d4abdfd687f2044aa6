 GOVERNOR Hope Uzodinma of Imo State has advised the members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state to stop disturbing the peace of the state with their unending rallies and protest over the Supreme Court judgement that sacked Emeka Ihedioha from office as governor. Members of the PDP had on Thursday protested again in Owerri over the Supreme Court judgement, calling for review of the judgement. Uzodinma, who addressed members of the All Progressives Congress in the state who took to the streets of Owerri on Saturday to show solidarity to him, advised the opposition to wait for 2023 election if they hope to return back to power. The governor, represented by the deputy governor of the state, Prof. Placid Njoku, said “Anybody still talking about Imo State governorship election must be talking about 2023. As for 2019, the issue is over. The elections are over. The litigations are also over. On January 14, 2020 the Supreme Court gave us judgement and declared Senator Hope Uzodinma as the truly elected governor of Imo State. That day, the issue was over. The issue has been settled by the court. The issue has been settled by God. The other party had 15 SANs during the Supreme Court hearing. If there was anything to point out, they could have pointed it out if it was necessary. We wish PDP well. They can contest in 2023 and lose again.” Uzodinma commended the APC members for making a case for peace in the state, assuring them that with him, there would be an enduring peace in the state. The state chairman of the APC, Prince Marcellinus Nlemigbo, said the party members came to show the governor that the decision of the apex court was good for the state. Also speaking, a leader of the party from Orlu senatorial zone, Chief Rex Anunobi, accused the PDP of hiring crowds from the neighbouring states to disturb the peace of the state. He said the party and the state government would no longer tolerate the disturbances of the opposition party.
