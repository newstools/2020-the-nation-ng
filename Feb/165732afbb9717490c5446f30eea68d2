A 19-year-old gas attendant, Samuel Williams, is writhing in pains following a gas explosion that occurred last November 29. Williams, the son of a driver at The Nation, is calling on well-meaning Nigerians to assist in funding his medical bill. He spoke to The Nation at Munnarid Hospital, Egbe, Lagos, where he is receiving treatment. Reliving how the explosion occurred, Williams said he had closed for the day before a customer called for a refill. “After I refilled the cylinder, I noticed that one of the cylinders was leaking. As I was trying to rectify it, a neighbour, who sell moinmoin, lighted a matchstick and the next thing I heard was a loud sound. There was fire everywhere. Me and my colleague were burnt. People rescued us and rushed us to hospital. “I want Nigerians to help me because the pain is much,” he said. Williams’ father, Inyang, said that the incident had made him financially-incapacitated. He said the family had spent N250,000 for treatment so far, but more funds were still required to get Samuel back on his feet. According to him, the physician, Dr. Tajudeen, said the boy needs about N1.5 million to fully recover from the injury he sustained.
