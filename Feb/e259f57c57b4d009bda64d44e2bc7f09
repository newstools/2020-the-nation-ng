Minister of Youth and Sports Development Sunday Dare on Monday alerted the police to the alleged invasion of his hometown, Ogbomoso, by suspected thugs. He tweeted via his handle @SundayDareSD: “Reports reaching me from my hometown Ogbomoso indicate they are under siege by thugs unleashed by some powers in Ibadan. “All Progressives Congress (APC) members are under siege. There can be no justification for this. “@PoliceNG must rise to the occasion to avoid planned attacks.”
