The Vice Chancellor, Lagos State University (LASU), Ojo, Prof. Olanrewaju Fagbohun, says dismissal of former executive members of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) still stands. Fagbohun made the clarification while responding to the letter of Prof. Biodun Ogunyemi, ASUU national president, on the election of new ASUU executive in the institution. “Dr. Akinloye Oyewuni, Dr. Adebowale Adeyemi-Suenu and Dr. Adebisi Aboderin-Shonibare were dismissed from the service of LASU in accordance with the university regulations guiding the conduct of workers and in line with global best practices. “Regarding, the legality of the newly elected executive members of ASUU-LASU, it is a pure union matter in which management does not interfere,” he said. Also, Dr. Ibrahim Bakare, the newly elected chairman, ASUU-LASU, said they need to state unequivocally that the tenure of the immediate past executive lapsed in February 2018. Bakare said that between 2017 and 2019, five members of the past executive were disengaged from the service of LASU. “The former chairman, Dr. Isaac Oyewumi and his deputy, Dr. Adeyemi Suenu, were disengaged in 2017 and former secretary, Dr. Tony Dansu, Dr. Oyekan Adeolu and the Treasurer, Dr. Aboderin-Shonibare, were disengaged in 2019,” he said. Ogunyemi had in his letter to the vice chancellor, claimed that until cases of the dismissal of the five members of the former ASUU-LASU leaders are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, they remain the recognised executive of ASUU-LASU.
