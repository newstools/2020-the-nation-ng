FRANK LAMPARD has insisted there is no tension with Chelsea’s board over him dropping Spain goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga. The Spanish stopper commanded a world-record transfer fee for a goalkeeper when he joined Chelsea for £72million in August 2018. The 25-year-old has fallen out of favour at Stamford Bridge though, with veteran Willy Caballero stepping up for the last two Premier League matches. But now Lampard has insisted he is under no pressure to select the big-money signing.  Asked if he is on a collision course with Chelsea’s board over dropping Kepa, Lampard replied: “Certainly not. That fills a lot of headlines for people. “I’m absolutely together with all the club and the board, because we all want the best. “And I’m paid to make decisions. So with form I have to consider the goalkeeper position. “Recently it’s just changed, but that’s nothing final. All Kepa needs to do is train and show a great attitude, as I demand from all the players. And things can obviously change. But all I want is the best for the team.”
