 THE Academic Staff Union of Research Institutions (ASURI) has urged the Federal Government to fund research in order to address poverty and unemployment. Its National Secretary General, Dr. Theophilus Ndubuaku, made the appeal yesterday in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos. He said: “The country is faced with the challenge of poverty. “The problem now is that we have natural resources more than almost every other nation in the world, but we are not doing research to develop it and create wealth. “Research is key to Nigeria’s development and the only way we can develop is to fund it.” Ndubuaku said that many researches being carried out at the nation’s universities were not adequate for development of the country. He said the country was fortunate to have many research institutions in every sector with available researchers, “yet these institutions lack adequate funding.” The national secretary general said: “Nigeria is not funding research and we have so many research institutions, that, if we start to fund them, within one year, issues of poverty and unemployment will be addressed. “We used to be net exporters of some products in the past, but now, we are importers of those things we used to export, yet we have the infrastructure in place to do research. “We have so much capability in terms of wealth and if we start to develop our resources, we will generate money.” He said that the union was making efforts to ensure that more researches were being done in the country. Ndubuaku lamented that the government lacked the political will to fund research.
