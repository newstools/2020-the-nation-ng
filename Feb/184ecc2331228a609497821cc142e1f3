 THE Lagos State Government has appealed to residents, particularly the leisure and entertainment business operators, to be compliant with environmental laws guiding their operations during Valentine Day’s celebration. It urged them to “spread love and not noise”. Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency (LASEPA) General Manager Dr. Dolapo Fasawe and Lagos State Safety Commission Director-General Mr. Lanre Mojola, in a joint statement at the weekend, enjoined events’ organisers to consider the environment and safety of the people by obtaining permits. They warned against activities that could be harmful or sow the seed of hate, rather than love. “The message of St. Valentine is to spread love… If our deed contradicts the reason for the celebration and impose unnecessary hardship on our supposed friends and allies, then we have failed to observe the tenets of St. Valentine,” Fasawe said, adding: “We cannot separate noise from celebrations, but we can do the needful by operating within approved decibels, thereby reducing the negative effects of noise pollution on everyone.
