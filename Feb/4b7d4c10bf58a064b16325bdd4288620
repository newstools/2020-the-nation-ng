Cultists belonging to the Aye confraternity have displayed the severed heads of one of their victims on the social media. Several persons have been killed in different parts of Benin City and environs since last month when members of Aye and Eiye confraternities resumed hostilities. It was gathered the ongoing cult war began when the rival groups decided the celebrate the one year anniversary of the killings of their leaders. A special squad has been deployed to Edo State by the Inspector General of Police, Adamu Mohammed, to stop the cult killings and arrest their leaders no matter how powerful they are. In a viral video displaying the severed head, the cultists said the deceased was an Eiye member living in Upper Sokponba that strayed to Ogiso area along the Murtala Mohammed Way. They said they would behead many Eiye members and ensure they are routed out of Edo State. The severed head might belong to a headless body found last Monday and dumped at Ikpoba slope close to Ogiso area. Edo Police Commissioner, Jimeta Lawan, had on Wednesday paraded 26 suspected cultists, who he said were members of Black Axe, Aye, Eiye and Vikings confraternities. Lawan said they have confessed to being members of the criminal societies and were involved in perpetrating all sorts of atrocities and criminalities in the state.
