Enyimba’s expedition for a first CAF Confederation Cup title will continue with a two-legged tie against Horoya in the quarter-finals, while Al-Masry take on RS Berkane. This was revealed during the draw ceremony for the last eight which took place on Wednesday evening at the Hilton Pyramids Golf Hotel. And the result saw the Nigerians square up against the Guineans who finished as Group B winners without losing any of their six games in a zone that boasts Djoliba and Bidest Wits. In other pairings, surprise package Al Nasr of Libya will be involved in another heavyweight tie, as they face Moroccan giants Hassania Agadir who topped Group D. Zambian giants Zanaco beat DC Motemba Potembe to the ticket for the quarter-final, and they would be hoping to continue with their fairytale against Egypt’s Pyramid. Fatai Osho’s men host the Guineans in the first leg on March 1, 2020 before travelling to Conakry seven days later for the game billed for Stade du 28 Septembre. Elsewhere in the CAF Champions League, Egypt’s Ahly will have a chance to avenge their humiliating defeat by South Africa’s Mamelodi Sundowns last season as both sides were paired in the African Champions League quarterfinals. Zamalek, who last won the competition in 2002, will face Esperance three times in around three weeks as both sides clash in the African Super Cup on 14 February. In the other quarter-final games, Morocco’s Raja take on TP Mazembe of the DR Congo and Wydad Casablanca meet Etoile. The winners of the Zamalek-Esperance game will meet either Raja or Mazembe while the winners of the Ahly-Sundowns match will face either Wydad or Etoile in the semifinals.
