 OVER 200 residents of Wasimi Community in Ojokoro Local Council Development have benefited from a free Medical and Welfare Outreach Programme oganised by the Baale of the community, Chief Andrew Adewale Sobitan. Chief Sobitan said the gesture was part of giving back to the society and to encourage residents to take their health serious. Some of the services rendered included eye screening, blood pressure, blood sugar level and general consultation. There were also free eyeglasses and drugs for participants. Sobitan said his family came up with the initiative as part of the Sobitan’s family Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) to the community. “Going to see a doctor and taking care of your health may spare you so many things. From observation and my experience, I know people are reluctant to go and check their medical status. As a community leader, I felt it is necessary to provide an avenue for people to go for medical check-up because early diagnosis saves money,” he said. He advised Nigerians to always look after their health and live a healthy life. “Health is wealth, as they rightly say. It makes no sense to be wasting money on ailment at old age. If you already know that you have hypertension, diabetes… you will be able to manage it and you will live longer and healthy,” he said. Otun Baale of Wasinmi Chief Mustapha Muritala urged coorporate organisations to complement government’s effort in providing quality health care for the grass roots. “The government cannot do it alone; we need to support the government through this initiative,” he said. Osi Baale of Wasimi Chief Olarewaju Sobitan urged other residents to join hands with the baale to develop the area. A relation, Alhaja Sherifat Bola Adeyemi, said the outreach was aimed at ensuring that people in the community were healthy enough to move on with their lives.
