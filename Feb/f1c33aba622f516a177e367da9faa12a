There is nothing as satisfying as being surrounded by people who love and cherish you unconditionally. Founder of Chrisland Schools and Chancellor of Chrisland University, Chief Winifred Awosika, has enjoyed plenty of that from family and friends, and she is grateful to God for the rare privilege. For her recent 80th birthday, friends, family members, colleagues, well-wishers came out en-masse to celebrate her and appreciate God in her life. The birthday celebration started at the Archbishop Vining Memorial Church, GRA, Ikeja, Lagos, and ended with a colourful reception at The Haven Event Centre, GRA, Ikeja. There were enough cakes to share as the hall was decorated with different sizes and designs. Most of the cakes were given by people whose live mama had touched positively one way or the other. Alake of Egbaland, Oba Gbedebo Adedotun, Senator Remi Tinubu; First Lady of Lagos, Dr. Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu and Senator Olabiyi Durijaiye graced the ceremony.
