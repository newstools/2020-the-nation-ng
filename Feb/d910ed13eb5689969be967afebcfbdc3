 ANTHONY Joshua has hailed “gladiator” Tyson Fury following his stunning Knockout win over Deontay Wilder at the MGM Grand, Las Vegas in the early hours of Sunday. Fury dropped the American in the third and fifth rounds before Wilder’s corner threw in the towel in the seventh session. The result means Fury is now a two-time heavyweight champion following his win over Wladimir Klitschko in 2015. Wilder has 30 days to activate the rematch clause in his contract but will also need treatment on a suspected burst eardrum. That could open the door for Joshua who holds the other three belts. He is due to defend those against mandatory challenger Kubrat Pulev at the Tottenham Stadium on June 20, but promoter Eddie Hearn is keen to host an undisputed fight instead. Fury may have already started the mind games with his domestic rival by wearing a gumshield in the colours of Nigeria, where Joshua has roots. And the 2012 Olympic champion posted a picture of Fury’s mouthpiece with the caption “gladiator”. He also posted a picture of Wilder slumped in his corner with the same tribute.
