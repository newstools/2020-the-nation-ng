Tension heightened in Obiaruku and its neighbouring communities in Ukwuani local government area of Delta State when youths from Umusume and Obi-Edike communities clashed which led to the death of two youths in both communities. It was learnt that those who were alleged to have sustained gunshots injuries from both communities over the clash had led to the shutting down schools, market and other commercial activities in the area. The crises, it was gathered not unconnected with the aged-long land dispute between the people of Umusume, an Obiaruku community and Obi-Edike quarter in Obinomba community in Umukwata kingdom. The clash was said to have started when youths from Obinomba community who were celebrating Ukwata festival and encroached into Umusume community in Obiaruku. The encroachment was to have provoked Umusume community, which has led to the clash between the two communities. Close sources that confirmed the development, had revealed that security had been beefed up in the area as sporadic gunshots forced residents of the twin communities to desert their homes. One of the sources Mr. Solomon alleged that those who sustained severe injuries had been rushed to hospital in neighbouring university community of Abraka in Ethiope East local government area. â€œObinomba was supposed to be celebrating their Ukwata Festival by now but some persons from Obinomba in Umukwata Kingdom encroached into Umusume, an Obiaruku community to celebrate their festival. That angered the Umusume community. All attempt to reach the State Police Commissioner, Mr Hafiz Inuwa for comments failed but a senior police officer from the Obiaruku Police Station confirmed the development when contacted but added that relative peace has returned to the warring communities following police intervention.
