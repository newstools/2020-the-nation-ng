He said: “… having x-rayed the activities of Dr. Cairo Ojougboh in the Niger Delta Development Commission, found out he is very transparent in his work as the Acting Executive Director of projects…” Ojougboh, who thanked the organisation for the award, said: “I am delighted for this recognition because this award is coming from a country like Rwanda with very impressive record of anti-corruption efforts, a country that has zero tolerance for corruption. As a soldier of truth and National Patron of Soldiers for Truth International Advocacy, I want say that that no man is hated as much as one who tells the truth; but once you imbibe the spirit of the truth, you will be free. Therefore I am glad that people realise we are telling the truth.”
