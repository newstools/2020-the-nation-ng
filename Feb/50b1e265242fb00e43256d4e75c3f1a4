 The Ministry of Defence on Tuesday paid severance benefits of 184 deceased officers and soldiers under the Federal Government’s Group Life Insurance Scheme. The beneficiaries were those who died in active service between 2018 and 2019. Defence Minister Major.-Gen. Bashir Salihi Magashi (retd.) presented the cheques to the widows of the deceased officers at a solemn ceremony at the Defence Headquarters (DHQ) in Abuja. He said: “We cannot compensate you more than what we have done, but we will continue to pray that God will give you the strength to bear the loss and train the children these fallen heroes left behind.” On behalf of the families of the deceased officers, Mr. Casmir Ndinfo thanked the Federal Government for the prompt payment of the entitlements. He urged the government to continue to improve on the welfare of the families the fallen heroes left behind to reduce their plight.
