About 500 youths in Kogi state are expected to benefit from the empowerment scheme of popular gospel artist, Esther Osaji. The artist said she would use her mega musical concert themed “worship untamed” to unveil her plans for youths in the state. The concert will hold in Lokoja, the Kogi State capital, its Host, Dr. Tobi Bello, said in a statement in Abuja. The concert is being organised in collaboration with Pastor Alfred Owoyemi-led youth wing of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) Kogi State Chapter. According to the statement, the musician-turned philanthropist will unveil her empowerment program that will serve as a means to an end. Osaji noted that evangelism had gone beyond preaching the word alone to empowering people. Bello said it was important for youths in the country to be usefully engaged. The statement reads: “When you pray for God’s blessings, it is important for you to be actively engaged in one thing or the other. The Bible said that God will bless the work of your hands. What we plan to do is to ensure that 500 youths are equipped with different skills. “With the skills, they can work and fend for themselves and God will then be able to bless the work of their hand. It is important to worship and praise God.” Bello also said the concert would provide opportunity for Kogi people to link up and have a good time with their creator. “It is time to praise God again in a grand style. This is going to be the biggest gospel concert Kogi has ever seen. Come and worship God,” he added. Other gospel artists who will be ministering at the concert are: Lord Bishop, David G, Jonas Dan, Yohanna and TAP, Joshua Kings and many others.
