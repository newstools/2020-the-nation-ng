 The Air Task Force (ATF) of Operation LAFIYA DOLE has destroyed an Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) training camp at Kirta Wulgo on the fringes of the Lake Chad in the Northern part of Borno State under the ongoing air interdiction code named Operation Rattle Snake 3. The air strikes according to the Director Public Relations and Information, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola followed credible intelligence reports as well as series of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions which established that some structures within the settlement were being used by the terrorists to house and train their fighters. “Accordingly, the ATF dispatched an enhanced force package of attack aircraft to engage the identified locations within the settlement. The fighter jets took turns attacking the target area in successive passes taking out the training facilities. “The NAF, operating in concert with surface forces, will sustain its air campaign to shape the battlespace in the Northeast for the effective conduct of further ground and air operations,” Daramola stated.
