 The Deputy Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Uche Mefor, has advised family members of the group to be prepared to defend themselves against any aggression that may possibly fallout during Nnamdi Kanu’s parents burial in Isiama Afaraukwu in Umuahia North Local Government Area of Abia State. Mefor’s call is coming after the Commissioner of Police (CP Ene Okon) issued a strict warning to IPOB members to steer clear from the burial of Kanu’s parents which comes up on Friday February 14. CP Okon was alleged to have declared that any member of the secessionist group sighted with insignia, Biafra or Jewish flags will have his or herself to blame. The Police commissioner also warned the Afaraukwu community leaders to inform members of the group not to attend the burial or they will scatter the burial process. Reacting on his timeline, the Radio Biafra deputy leader, Mefor stated it is “sacrilege, abomination’ for the Nigeria Police, Army to had brought about what killed His Royal Majesty, Eze Sir Israel and Lolo Ugoeze Sally Okwu-kanu without remorse.” He said amidst the tears and lost the CP issuing statement to stop the family from giving them a befitting burial. Mefor called on all family units coming to the burial to be ready to defend selves against any extrajudicial murder, intimidation and aggression by the army or police. He further queried: ” Where else does the government want them to go than to remain in their land?”
