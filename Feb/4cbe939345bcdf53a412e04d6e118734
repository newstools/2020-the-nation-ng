 Former Golden Eaglets forward Terem Moffi has shifted his focus on getting KV Kortrijk to the Belgium Cup finals after scoring his second goal in three matches in the Belgium top division and being named in the Jupiler Pro League Team of the Week by Unibet. Moffi scored in the 70th minute as Kortrijk beat Standard Liege 3-1 on Friday to justify his first start in the league after his great individual goal at home against defending champions and league leaders Club Brugge last week. It was yet another solid outing by the 20-year old who got a standing ovation when he was substituted in the 74th minute and was named the man-of-the-match for the second consecutive match to crown his heroics on the field. The convincing home win has lifted Kortrijk to 12th on the table with 26 points from 24 matches and served as a great warm-up for them leading up to the second leg of the semi-final of the Belgian FA Cup. Kortrijk will host Royal Antwerp at the Guldensporen Stadion on Thursday after a 1-1 draw in the first leg last month. “It was a very good match for us, but we have to keep working hard. The match in the Cup against Antwerp is not that far anymore,” Moffi said. “In the first half we missed some chances and after the break they went in. We scored three goals in a difficult game and we can be very satisfied with that” Moffi joined Kortrijk on a three and a half year deal in January after he fired 20 goals for FK Riteriai in the Lithuanian top league last season.
