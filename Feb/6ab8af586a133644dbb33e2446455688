TWO Ghanaian university lecturers have been suspended without pay after a BBC investigation reported they had sexually harassed undercover reporters posing as students. The University of Ghana suspended Ransford Gyampo for six months and Paul Butakor for four months. Both deny the allegations made last year in BBC Africa Eye’s sex-for-grades documentary. A Nigerian lecturer was also suspended after it was broadcast in October. Four academics were secretly filmed as part of a year-long investigation. BBC journalists posed as prospective students to expose sexual harassment and misconduct at both the University of Ghana and the University of Lagos. In one scene, Dr. Butakor is filmed asking an undercover journalist if he could become her “side guy”, adding that “a side will see how best to contribute to your career”. Prof Gyampo tells another undercover reporter that he will marry her. He then asks her what school she went to. After she responds, he says: “There is a rumour that the students of that school like penis.” Some believe the punishment is too lenient. But others feel the suspensions are enough to deter others from misbehaving in future.
