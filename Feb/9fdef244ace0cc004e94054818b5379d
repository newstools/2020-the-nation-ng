Senate President Ahmad Lawan has urged Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) of government, as well as corporate bodies, to partner the Yobe State government on the Mauyi Ganga fishing and cultural festival. A statement by his media aide, Ezrel Tabiowo, said Lawan spoke at the festival which held at River Alkamaram in Mauyi Ganga. The event featured colourful cultural displays, and was well attended by dignitaries, including Governor Mai Mala Buni, traditional rulers led by the Emir of Bade, Mai Suleiman Abubakar, and others. Lawan said the festival, which is capable of developing Nigeria’s tourism potential, would provide employment and create wealth for the people. The statement reads: “We are trying to diversify the economy through the promotion of agriculture, solid minerals development and tourism. In Yobe State, we are also trying to explore opportunities. The Mauyi Ganga annual fishing and cultural festivals is a very old event. “Unfortunately, in 1993 or there about, the festivities stopped due to some reason, and now that we are pushing for diversification, the government of Yobe and indeed the people of Bade emirate decided to revive and vitalise the event for our people’s benefit in addition to sustaining our culture. “The festival is an additional way of creating employment and wealth, and generating revenue for the government.”
