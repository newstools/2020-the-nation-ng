Former president of Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) Sani Lulu has commended the outstanding leadership displayed by the FCT FA chairman Adam Mouktar Mohammed since his landmark election last year. Lulu saluted Mohammed in his short time in the office, saying it is a testament of great things to come for football. Lulu, who was a one-time director of sports in the FCT Sports Council, praised Mohammed’s ingenuity, gigantic and purposeful steps in turning around and revitalising football in the FCT. “I want to, without mincing words, commend your leadership sagacity in revamping football in the state,” he remarked. “I have followed your programmes and have seen that you do not only have the passion for this game but the willing heart to work. “Your innovative ideas and capacity to do what you have done within a short time is a testament of great things to come in FCT football.” He also used his courtesy call to the FCT FA boss to present to Mohammed and his executive committee his club Fosla Football club (FFC), who will feature in the 2020 Nationwide League One (NLO). In his response, Mouktar Mohammed appreciated the visit by Lulu and promised that the FCT FA will give total support Fosla Football Club in the NLO.
