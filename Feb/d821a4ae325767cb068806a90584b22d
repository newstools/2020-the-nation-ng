 SUPER Falcons captain Asisat Oshoala was at her best as Barcelona demolished Real Sociedad 10-1 to win their first Spanish Supercopa Femenina in their history on Sunday. The Catalonia side had already wrapped up the game in the first half, scoring through Marta Torrejón, Alexia (2), Marta Torrejón, Oshoala and Graham. The 2019 African Player of the Year bundled the ball over the line 35 minutes into the game after failing to properly connect with the ball in her first attempt, giving Barcelona a 4-0 lead in the process. A minute before halftime, Oshoala turned provider as Alexia Putellas powerful left-footed strike sailed past goalkeeper Mariasun Quiñones. Things went from bad to worse for Real Sociedad six minutes into the second half as Oshoala increased the lead, slotting past the goalkeeper after a pass from Alexia following a breakaway move.
