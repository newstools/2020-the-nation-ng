In the episode, Alex sits with host, Pearl Thusi and opens up on several issues about him, his background, and how he built the Viacom business in Africa.

Alex also shared details of his early days in America, living in a gang-infested neighbourhood. “It was like the wild wild west out there”, and he had to move out of that neighbourhood after the death of his friend. He also talked about playing basketball, living with a foster mother, and how a knee injury ended his dream of playing in the NBA. On the launch of MTV in Africa, he said the goal at that time was to have Africans appreciate Africa. Alex, who achieved a personal and industry milestone when he identified a business gap for a youth music and lifestyle channel in Africa, developed the business plan and launched Viacom’s first localised channel in Africa, MTV Base, in 2005. Alex Okosi shared some exclusive stories about the early days of MTV in Africa, the challenges faced in building the business on the continent and the people behind the scenes that have made the company successful.
