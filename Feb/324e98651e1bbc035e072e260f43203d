Our Rporter Esperance defender Chamseddine Dhaouadi has stated that his side do not fear Zamalek ahead of their meeting against each other today  in the CAF Super Cup final in Qatar. The CAF Super Cup is set to take place between the winners of the CAF Champions League and the CAF Confederation Cup. Esperance clinched the Champions League title for the second year in a row against Wydad Casablanca, while Zamalek won the Confederation Cup for the first time in their history defeating RS Berkane in the final.  “The Super Cup game will be intense against a respectable opponent. What is important is that we ease our mission and enter the game right,” Dhaouadi said. “We have the qualities to overcome Zamalek who we do not fear.” Since the  competition was launched in 1993, Enyimba is the only Nigerian club to have won the  trophy following their successive victories  in the 2004 and 2005 editions  when they beat 1-0 Etoile du Sahel  of Tunisia (1-0) and  Hearts of Oak of Ghana (2-0) respectively.
