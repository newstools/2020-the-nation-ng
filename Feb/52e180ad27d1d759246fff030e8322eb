 Bayelsa Governor-elect, Senator Douye Diri, has promised to set up a reconciliation committee to pacify politicians and other groups in the state who may have been hurt by the Supreme Court judgment that sacked the All Progressives Congress(APC) Governorship candidate and former governor-elect, David Lyon. Diri, who addressed reporters shortly after being issued with a Certificate of Return by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), said that God has brought Bayelsa State to back on track. According to him: “As we go today to take the oath of office, the next agenda we have is to set up a reconciliation committee “The committee that will reconcile us out of the bitterness and acrimony that is currently rocking our State. “We want our people to be one, we want our people to be united. So the first step we will take is to set up a reconciliation committee”.
