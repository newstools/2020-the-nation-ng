 Students of the Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University Lapai (IBBUL), have urged  the Students’ Union and the school management to alleviate the transportation challenge that has been their lot, especially when they are heading for lectures during peak hours. CAMPUSLIFE gathered that since the commencement of the ongoing semester, students find it difficult getting into lecture halls before schedule, owing to shortage of means of transportation such as motorcycles, buses and tricycles. One of the students who pleaded anonymity, appealed to the authority to review the cost of services rendered by motocyclists in accordance with respective distances covered. “The cause (of scarcity in transportation) is unknown to me; but I suggest that the school management should provide more means of transportation because they only have few tricycles which only operate between main campus to kobo axis. By this, scarcity of motorcycles would reduce,” she said.  Similarly, Amina Mohammed a 200-Level Physics Education undergraduate, attributed the development to a handful of transport operators who are officially allowed by management to operate within the campus. In line with what Amina, said, Siraj Bala, a 200-Level student of Agricultural Science, added, “The cyclist men should be persuaded to register in order to reduce the difficulties students undergo,” she said. A third year student of Public Administration, Isah Muhammad, had a different opinion. “This shortage of bike is as a result of too much of admission offered students this academic session. Suggesting a way out, Isah charged the SU leaders to provide more buses that would be help convey students to their various destination. Also, Hamza Ibrahim Abaga, a final year students of Mass Communication, urged the school management to put a modality such as inviting non-governmental organisation to invest in order to assist the school transportation system.
