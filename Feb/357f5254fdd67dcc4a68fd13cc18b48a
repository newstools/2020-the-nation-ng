 Barring any last minute change of plan, Ekiti State Governor Dr. Kayode Fayemi is expected to sign an agreement on the implementation of the consequential salary adjustment arising from the new minimum wage with the organised labour on Friday. The Nation learnt from a source in the office of the Head of Service in Ado-Ekiti yesterday that Governor Fayemi had given the sub-technical committee ultimatum to submit its report before the joint negotiation committee for perusal.  He said that the enlarged negotiation committee would meet on Monday (today) to identify and iron out grey areas in the report of the sub-technical committee billed for submission in order to harmonise the interest of the government and organised labour before transmission for assent. He said that the delay in the implementation of the consequential adjustment was as a result of conflict of percentage between the government and labour team, adding: “But for the governor’s intervention, the agreement billed to be signed on or before Friday wouldn’t have been possible”.
