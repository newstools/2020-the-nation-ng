 Zimbabwe has been barred from hosting any international matches until further notice after its main stadiums failed to meet required standards. Zimbabwe’s FA (ZIFA) says the Confederation of African Football (CAF) took the decision after inspecting stadiums in November. It means that Zimbabwe’s key 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Algeria next month will now have to be played in a neutral venue. ZIFA says it has already started the process of finding “an alternative venue in neighbouring countries” to host games. CAF asked for improvement to three stadiums – Barbourfields, Mandava and the National Sports Stadium – but none have yet been addressed.
