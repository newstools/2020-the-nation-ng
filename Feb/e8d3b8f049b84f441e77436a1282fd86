 Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun said on Wednesday that his administration would not embark on frivolous spending. He said it will rather allocate resources to projects that have direct and positive impact on the people. Abiodun spoke at the turning of sod of 14km Ijebu-Ode-Epe road that links Ogun and Lagos states from the Epe end of Lagos State and Ijebu-Ode-Ikoto axis of Ogun State. The governor noted that the reconstruction of the road would not only ease traffic on the Lagos-Sagamu-Ore expressway, but would also bring relief to people by saving ‘’Nigerians value time in traffic.’’ He said the dual-carriage road has 10 lanes – four lanes on each side with one pull-out section, while the toll plaza comprises 14 lanes for easy payment of tolls, adding that it will engender the socio-economic development of the state and communities along the road corridor. Abiodun said: “We will unveil two major roads in Ota, Ogun West Senatorial District, in a matter of days. These roads also link our state with Lagos. We should also keep in mind that Ogun State and Lagos State are still in talks with the Federal Government for the release of the rehabilitation of Lagos-Sango Ota-Abeokuta expressway and Sagamu-Ogijo-Ikorodu road.”
