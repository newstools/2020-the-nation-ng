From Toba Adedeji and Yunus Abdulrasheed, KwaraPoly Students of the Federal Polytechnic Offa, Kwara State, have campaigned against ‘sex-for-grades’ at the 20th edition of the ongoing Nigeria Polytechnic Games holding in Ilorin. At the bi-annual polytechnic games, no fewer than 3,040 athletes from 51 institutions across the country are participating in 14 sporting events. The students, who held banner and hand flyers, joined the procession of other counterparts. The campaign against ‘sex-for-grades’ which was sponsored by the host school management started last week within the campus premises both the mini and main campus. Kwara State Deputy Governor Mr Kayode Alabi, who declared the games open at the Kwara State Polytechnic Sports Complex, urged the participating institutions to abide by the rules of the games. He added that the games would further foster unity and create mental alertness among participating institutions. Rector of the host institution, Dr Abdullateef Olatunji, also reacted on the campaign. He said: “It is one thing to campaign and it is another thing to walk the talk. Walking the talk does not necessarily rely on stakeholders but involves concerted efforts among all. That is how to do it. “We also want to spread the gesture to other institutions to uplift the quality of education in the country.” He noted that the management has made up its mind to ensure that all anti-social activities that are pervasive in so many institutions become a thing of the past.
