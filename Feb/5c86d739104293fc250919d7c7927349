 BAYELSA State-born actor,  Seun Kentebe, who  starred in award-winning movies, such as 93 Days and stage plays, is not happy, following some critics’ comments on filmmakers. The actor, who is active on Facebook, took to his page to lecture on the importance of granting funds to filmmakers. He wrote: “Parasite bags awards at the Oscars,” he said. “Now, almost everyone in Nigeria who aren’t filmmakers are quick to “lecture” Nollywood filmmakers on the basics needed to bag an Oscar.”Get better scripts,” “Come up with original, power packed stories,” “Location is key,” “Stop using the same faces,” “Actors speak with unnecessary fone,” and so on and so forth.” “Fun fact: Parasite was made with $11m. Convert that to Naira. When you have invested that in one Nollywood film and provided an enabling environment: 24 hr light and a film studio or three the size of a state, then we can have this conversation. “Until then, drink water and mind your business. You have no idea what it takes to make a film in this part of the world,” he stated. So far, Kentebe has won three awards: Best New Actor, Nollywood Reinvented Awards, 2014, Best Actor in a Short Film, Real time International Film Festival, 2017 and Best Actor of the Year, MSAA 2018.
