The Presidency on Monday alerted the public to the falsehood by “purveyors of fake news” against President Muhammadu Buhari, his family, ministers and the service chiefs. A statement by the Special Adviser (SA) to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr Femi Adesina, cited a news item which claimed that the President was due for a 20-day trip to the United Kingdom (UK), as one of such fabrications. Alerting the public to the falsehood and warning the citizens to avoid consuming unverified stories, especially from the social media, the statement said this is the only way to stop new wave of attack. “Purveyors of fake and concocted information are currently on overdrive, and Nigerians are urged to be careful what they consume as news, and share with others, particularly from the social media. “An unfounded information has been making the rounds that President Muhammadu Buhari is billed to travel to the United Kingdom for 20 days, and from there proceed to Saudi Arabia, and then Austria. Fake. It is nothing but falsehood from mischievous minds. “Members of the First Family, ministers, top government officials, the military, and other key institutions, are equally objects of this orchestrated falsehood, coming from enemies of national cohesion. “We urge Nigerians to be discriminatory about what they accept as credible information, and restrain themselves from sharing what they have not authenticated as genuine. That is how we can all collectively beat the malevolent minds at their pernicious games,” the statement said.
