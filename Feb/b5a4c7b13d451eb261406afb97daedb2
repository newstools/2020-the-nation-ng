 At least 50 suspected cultists have been arrested by a police squad, ‘Operation Safe Delta,’ in Udu council area of Delta state. The suspects were reportedly apprehended by the Police team, late Thursday. It was gathered that they were nabbed at different brothels and hideouts across the council area. Before the police raid, there had been several clashes between rival cult groups which led to killings and robberies in the area, creating fear among residents. Confirming the development on telephone, the Delta State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Mohammed Hafiz Inuwa, said the arrests were made to curb the continuous cult rivalry in the locality. His words: “They were actually arrested because of the cult crisis going on. I felt I should send a team to go and bring the menace down and deal with the problem of cultism. “We are not going to relent. We will continue our war against these cultists because a situation whereby they take delight in injuring themselves, to the extent of even waging war against themselves, killing themselves, I will not tolerate that.”
