 A 32-YEAR-old woman identified as Hassana Bala has been arrested by police in Niger State for attempting to kidnap a 23-year-old man,  Umar Sarkin Turaku of Kawo village in Kontagora  Local Government Area of the state. Hassana had sent threatening phone calls to Turaku asking him to pay a ransom of  N5 million or risk being kidnapped. Luck, however, ran out of the mother of two when Turaku reported the phone calls to the police who traced and arrested Hassana. Speaking to newsmen when she was paraded in Minna, Hassana said that it was her boyfriend who introduced her to kidnapping, adding that her part is usually to make threatening phone calls to the people and arrange where the money would be dropped while the other members of the gang would pick up the money. She said, “After separating from my husband, I got a man friend who introduced me to this wicked act and that was how I started the kidnapping business. “Since I left my husband my life has changed for the worse,” she said, and then asked for forgiveness. Police spokesman  Muhammad Abubakar said the matter would be charged to court after investigation.
