Yinka Adeniran, Ibadan  The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Oyo State Command, on Monday, paraded three cyber cafe operators for allegedly extorting applicants for the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB). The State Commandant, Iskilu Akinsanya, paraded the suspects at the Command Headquarters in Agodi, Ibadan, the Oyo State capital. Akinsanya said the three suspects operated LNETWork Cyber Cafe, Value Max and GG Media Cyber Cafe adding that the suspects operates an unlicensed Computer Base Test (CBT) Centre and sold JAMB forms to applicants above the approved price of N4,700. He said, “The suspects sold the form at the rate of N5, 500 to JAMB applicants which is against the Federal government approved price. The Registrar of JAMB, Ishaq Oloyede, has made it clear that on no account should any centre sell above the approved price. “Following our intelligence, we gathered that some Cyber Cafe are selling above the price and we swung into action and the three suspects were arrested.” He lamented that the excesses in the charges would put a burden on the parents and the Federal government frowns at it, adding that it is a crime and part of the corruption being fought in the country. Calling on applicants not to patronise illegal CBT centres, the Commandant advised them to alert NSCDC whenever they notice any centre selling above the approved price. One of the suspects, the owner of Value Max Cyber Cafe, when asked told reporters that they were just assisting the students to generate codes and not collecting money from them, saying he was not aware that helping the students to generate codes was a crime.
