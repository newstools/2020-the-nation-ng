 A legal practitioner , Nelson Okedinachi, has asked a Federal High Court siting in Owerri, the Imo State Capital to declare the seats of the speaker and 19 other members of the Imo State House of Assembly, who defected from their various political parties to the All Progressive Congress (APC) vacant. The lawmakers defected from the Action Alliance (AA); Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) to the ruling All Progresive Congress (APC). In a Suit No: FHC/OW/CS/20/2020, Learned Counsel asked the court to determine whether, upon proper interpretation of Section 109(1)(g) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended), the defected lawmakers were not liable to vacate their seats as members of the Imo State House of Assembly having defected from their original political parties to the All Progresive Congress (APC). In his reliefs, the lawyer sought an order of the court to declare the lawmakersâ€™ seats vacant pursuant to 109(1)(g) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.  He also prayed the court to direct the affected lawmakers to return to the Imo state treasury all salaries, allowances and benefits paid to them as members of the state house of assembly. He further sought for an order directing the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to immediately conduct elections for the constituencies of the affected lawmakers. The affected lawmakers included the speaker, Chiji Collins (Isiala Mbano); majority leader, Chigozie Nwaneri (Oru East); Amarachi Chyna Iwuanyanwu (Nwangele); Innocent Egwim(Ideato North); Dominic Ezerioha(Oru West)and Chidiebere Ogbunikpa (Okigwe).
