 FOREMOST Nigerian sound engineer, Iloyi Oluwole Adebayo, has blasted organisers of some entertainment awards for often forgetting to celebrate sound engineers. According to Adebayo, who is better known as Indomix, sound engineers are solely responsible for the first class mixing and mastering of many songs. Indomix disclosed that Sound Engineers are one of the very important live wires in the music industry especially as they are saddled with the responsibility of putting together the vocals, ad-libs, sequence, progression, after-effects, finishing, and gloss of many songs noting that without the Sound Engineers job, you definitely would have a headache, listening to anything fresh from the artistes. “I don’t know what is wrong with organisers of awards ceremony,” said Indomix. “They give credence to the artiste alone leaving out those of us who are the brain behind their success. When they have nice beat and they voice on it, people enjoy and want to keep listening to the tracks but when it comes to recognitions, we are majorly left out.” However, Indomix reiterated that just like the movie industry where the script writer is vital and often time celebrated, there is need for same in the music industry.
