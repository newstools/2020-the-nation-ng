The failure of the Nigeria Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), to submit its audited Accounts to the Auditor General of the Federation from 2014 till date has led to the House of RepresentativesÂ  Committee on Public Accounts to decide probing the Agency. The Oluwole Oke-led Committee made the pronouncement when the Director-General of the Agency, Hon Dakuku Peterside appeared before it, on Thursday. Peterside could not give satisfactory explanations why the audited Accounts were not remitted to the appropriate quarters as at when due. The Committee, which is currently investigating the alleged deliberate and reckless refusal by non-Treasury Funded MDAs to render audited accounts to the Office of the Auditor-General of the Federation, descibed as an afterthought the explanations by the Agency that the audited report for the period under review was ready but that it has not been approved by the Board of the Agency. Peterside though maintained that the reports were yet to be approved and signed by the Board of the Agency, also revealed that he met accumulated unaudited Accounts of the Agency, upon his assumption of office as the DG.
