 A male hyena, which escaped from Imo State Zoological Garden and Wildlife Park in Nekede Owerri West Council area of the state at the early hours of Monday, has been recaptured by wildlife experts. The hyena was captured outside the zoo barely six hours after it escaped from the zoo. General Manager of the wildlife park, Mr. Francis Abioye, confirmed the escape and recapturing of the wild animal on Monday. Before the recapturing, there was heavy panic within the autonomous community, a host community of the facility. However, the GM, who led the operation, said there was no casualty as the animal was recaptured by experts through “Physical Restricted Method,”. He said the operation lasted for six hours before the animal was eventually captured. Explaining how it escaped, Abioye said the animal dug a big hole underground which made it possible for it to escape from the cage. He said after the animal broke out from its den, it fled into the community through a broken fence in the zoo which he said was allegedly vandalized by youths of the community in 2019. “I can confirm to you that a giant Hyena escaped from its cage early this morning through underground hole it dug but was latter recaptured by experts. “The animal was able to escape the the zoo premises through a vandalized part of the perimeter fence within the conservative area of the zoo,” he said. He said the operation was aided by armed personnel of Civil Defense corps who were attached to the zoo. Abioya however advised the general public to go about their normal business as the situation has been put under control.
