 Governor Samuel Ortom has urged the Federal Government not to dismiss the World Bank report on the increasing number of destitute in the country. The governor gave the advice yesterday while addressing journalists after a courtesy call on him by the Feed The Future Nigeria Agri-business Investment Activity led by Mr. Farouk Lawan, Deputy Chief of Party. The governor stated that with the regular churning out of graduates by various institutions without a corresponding employment measures, there is need for urgent action to encourage the productive sector through youth empowerment opportunities. He said production rate must be greater than consumption for the country to get things right, pointing out that it is the only way the World Bankâ€™s projection of over 80 million destitute in the near future could be averted. Governor Ortom called on the Federal Government to encourage industries operating in the country, by ensuring conducive working environment; stating that folding up of companies due to harsh economic policies is adversely affecting the economy. The governor, during the courtesy call, pledged to collaborate with Feed The Future Nigeria Agribusiness Investment to promote agricultural activities in the state through training and capacity building. Deputy Chief of Party Feed The Future Nigeria Agribusiness Investment Activity, Mr. Farouk Lawan, stated that the organisation would soon embark on capacity building and training of market women in agribusiness. He said farmers in the state would also be trained on how to access loans, ranging from one hundred thousand to ten million naira from the Bank of Industry and other financial institutions.
