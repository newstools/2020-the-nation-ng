Commonwealth and African Champion Ese Brume continued her good form this season as she set a new indoor personal best of 6.82m at the Meeting Hauts-de-France Pas-de-Calais in Lievin, France on Wednesday night. Despite playing second fiddle to Maryna Bekh-Romanchuk of Belarus in the women’s long jump event, Brume beat her last week’s PB of 6.79m to set new PB of 6.82m being her third Indoor Tour this year. At the ISTAF Meet in Berlin, Germany last week, Brume jumped 6.79m to finish second behind World Champion, Malaika Mihambo of Germany who leapt to a world lead jump of 7.07m. Brume faced a more competitive field which ended with Belarusian confirming her status as overall Tour winner in emphatic fashion as she won with a last round effort of 6.90m – the fourth best achieved this season – to move ahead of Brume, whose best was 6.82m. Third place went to Nastassia Mironchyk-Ivanova, the European indoor silver medalist, who reached 6.59m.
