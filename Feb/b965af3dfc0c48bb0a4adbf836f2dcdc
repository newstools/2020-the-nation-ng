In line with their Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability initiatives, sister insurers, FBNInsurance and FBN General Insurance, recently donated various items to homes and hospices across three geographical regions, Lagos, Abuja and Port Harcourt. The companies visited children at the Heritage Homes & Orphanage (Lagos), The Poorest of the Poor Orphanage (Abuja) and Rhema Orphanage Home (Port Harcourt). The company donated items such as food, beverages, toiletries and electrical appliances to the Homes. Also recently, both companies made similar donations to the Down Syndrome Foundation Nigeria, Lagos. Most of the items donated were largely raised through the companies’ yearly Staff Gift Drive, an in-house scheme that encourages staff members of both companies to donate various items for a common cause. The FBNI Staff Gift Drive which began in 2015 is in its fifth year.  Speaking at the presentation ceremony in Lagos, the Heritage Homes & Orphanage Assistant General Manager, Mr. Reuben Amara, expressed delight at the goodwill of the insurers. “We cannot thank the Board and Management of FBNInsurance and FBN General Insurance enough for their commitment by continually supporting the Home,” he said. In her response, the Head, Marketing & Corporate Communications, FBNInsurance, Mrs. Elizabeth Agugoh, reassured the home of the insurers’ continued commitment to support the cause of the organisation in making the society a better place. FBNInsurance is a Limited Liability Company licensed to transact life insurance business in Nigeria. The company is owned by FBN Holdings Plc (65 per cent) and Sanlam Group, SA (35 per cent) while FBN General Insurance is a  subsidiary of FBNInsurance.
