 LAGOS State Government has said that henceforth, block moulders must have their blocks stamped by the Lagos State Materials Testing Laboratory (LSMTL), as a means of identification. This, the government, said, was part of the efforts to maintain a safe built environment. Speaking yesterday at a meeting with the Block Moulders Association, Lagos State chapter, the LSMTL General Manager, Dr. Tajudeen Afolabi, said that the agency would re-register all block moulders as a means of identification. “Your association is the first set of stakeholders I am meeting upon my assumption of office as the general manager. The meeting is necessary to find solution to the causes of building collapse and structural failure. Your body is an important one because there is nobody that wants to go into construction that will not need your services,” he said. Afolabi said the agency will go on monitoring, adding that any block moulder who does not meet the laid down standard will be sanctioned. He called for synergy between block moulders and the agency, urging them to alert him on the activities of unregistered block moulders. The LSMTL boss said that from next week, illegal block moulders would be sanctioned “because as a responsible government, the safety of citizens’ lives is paramount.” The Lagos State chapter Chairman of the association, Otunba Rasheed Alesinloye, hailed the efforts of the government to reduce the number of collapse buildings. Vice Chairman Alhaji Yusuf Akinsanmi suggested re-verification of the certificates given to block moulders. “They should be allowed to retain their old numbers and LSMTL seal should be stamped on them,” he said.
