Former leaders of three African countries – Bai Koroma (Sierra Leone), Ellen Johnson Sirleaf (Liberia) and Hailemariam Desalegn (ex-Prime Minister of Ethiopia) are among eminent leaders expected at the 83rd birthday of former President Olusegun Obasanjo. Also, Chinese and Indian ambassadors to Nigeria are expected to speak on the topic: Asian Aspiration and Lessons for Africa, at the celebration that will hold from March 3 to 5 in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. The Director of Centre for Human Security and Dialogue (CHSD) of the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL), Prof. Peter Okebukola, broke the news to reporters yesterday in Abeokuta. He said the CHSD, with the support of The Benthurst Foundation, will organise an international policy with the theme: The Asian Aspiration. Okebukola said the lecture would help share lessons from that Asian continent to strengthen Africa’s integration and cooperation in socioeconomic development. The former Secretary of the National Universities Commission (NUC) explained that Obasanjo’s birthday celebrations since he left office in 2007, have been used to evolve  development agenda relevant to the growth and advancement of Africa and the world. “The roundtable will bring together former Heads of State and Governments in Africa, especially from the ECOWAS sub-region, as well as representatives of United Nations (UN) agencies, ambassadors of foreign missions to Nigeria, leaders from the public and private sector, development partners,” Okebukola said.
