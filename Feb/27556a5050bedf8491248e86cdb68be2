Kehinde OLULEYE  Hats in general-both local and imported- have left the church scene to take a place on the fashion stage. This should not be surprising. Fashion is never static, it is always evolving. A hat may not come with or come with a brim nor festooned with flowers. But one thing you can be sure of is that, it will come in a tasteful variety of styles. All over the world, most popular caps are fashioned after the traditional French and English styles, featuring sinamay, straw, fez cap, raffia, soft, cozy and flexible wool which allow a snug fit for any shape of the head.  Though worn traditionally to rest more at the centre of the head than the other parts, most caps, as for the ladies, apart from beret, can also be pulled with the help of an elastic rubber strapped securely over the ears for added warmth. Cap is very versatile, lightweight and easy to slide on. Their colours vary, cute to be ignored and the fit is great. So, go funky with one.
