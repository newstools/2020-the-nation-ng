 ODION Ighalo made his Old Trafford debut as Manchester United thrashed Watford 3-0 in their English Premier League game on Sunday. Bruno Fernandes, Anthony Martial and Mason Greenwood all got themselves on the scoresheet, while former Super Eagles striker, Ighalo, missed an opportunity to score his first goal for his new club after coming in the 80th minute for Anthony Martial. Although the 30-year old forward successfully dribbled past the Goalkeeper Ben Foster, his shot got deflected by a Watford defender on to the upright. The deadline day loanee has made three substitute appearances since joining from Shanghai Shenhua in the last two games, including United’s wins against Chelsea in the Premier League and Club Brugge in the Europa League. Fellow new man, Bruno Fernandes opened his goalscoring account at Manchester United yesterday as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side climbed to fifth place in the Premier League table with a 3-0 win against lowly Watford. United have struggled for consistency all season but the victory at Old Trafford lifts them to 41 points, just three behind fourth-placed Chelsea.
