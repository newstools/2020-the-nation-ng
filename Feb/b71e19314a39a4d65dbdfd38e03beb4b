 Forbes recently released its annual exclusive billionaires ranking with only four Nigerians – Aliko Dangote, Mike Adenuga, Abdul Samad Rabiu and Folorunsho Alakija – making the coveted list. Of the four, Aliko Dangote, President of Dangote Group, retained his spot as the world’s richest black person with a fortune of $10.1 billion. Davido’s billionaire father, Adedeji Adeleke, wasn’t on the list. However, Adeleke, who is a noted billionaire, made a major statement for his first son, Adewale’s wedding. The marriage held at the Emirate International Palace, United Arab Emirates, took the city of Abu Dhabi by storm. It was gathered that apart from providing private jets, the Chief Executive Officer of Pacific Holdings gave out free tickets and hotels rooms to family and friends. The tallest building in the world and the most expensive five-star hotel, Burj Al Arab, in Dubai, was also said to have been booked by Adeleke, family members and guests. An after-party at Dubai Marina Yacht Club was another experience entirely for people who made it to Dubai. The wedding between Adewale and Ekanem started in Calabar with a family introduction. Some weeks later, a colourful traditional wedding took place at Calabar as well.
