In a bid to ease new car ownership for Nigerians, CFAO Motors, the sole distributor of Suzuki cars in Nigeria, has unveiled its vehicle Trade-in scheme. Interestingly, the Trade is non-restrictive to car brands or models, even if it was bought as a tokunbo (used) car. According to the Managing Director of CFAO Motors, Mr. Thomas Pelletier, the process is as simple as bringing in your current car for valuation and choosing to pay the balance for a brand new car up-front or through financing. For example, a Brand new Suzuki Dzire sold at N6 million, can be traded in with a Toyota Corolla 2013 valued at N1.7 million. Balance due: N4.3 million upfront or 109,000 naira/monthly (up to 60 months). So, only 20 per cent equity is needed for the financing. The valuation of your car will be done in Lagos at the company’s Akin Adesola, Victoria Island showroom only while financing options are also available in CFAO Motors offices in Abuja and Port Harcourt.” To this end, with as little as N3.7m or N85,000 monthly, anyone can own a brand new Suzuki car! The models available in Nigeria cut across compact cars, sedans and Sport Utility Vehicles with the Alto, Dzire, Swift, Baleno, Ciaz, Ertiga, Vitara and Jimny. Suzuki Motor Corporation is a Japanese multinational founded in 1909, known for manufacturing a wide range of products which include automobiles, motorcycles and outboard marine engines. With three million cars sold globally every year, the brand is recognised for its line-up of affordable compact cars. In Nigeria, Suzuki has been quite popular with the mini-buses and compact car taxis which have been plying the roads over the years.
