 SYSTEMSPECS, a provider of financial technology and human capital management solutions in Africa, has unveiled a new corporate identity to reposition its brand to fully maximise its potentials, explore greater fields of business possibilities, and rapidly enhance the delivery of top notch technology solutions and services to diverse market segments in Nigeria and across Africa. The firm made this known at an event at its new headquarters in Lagos to herald the new season of its business. The firm also announced the release of Paylink by Remita, a new product which empowers individuals, businesses and non-profits, especially those that seek to optimise social media as a one-stop-shop, to receive payments by simply sharing a link. On the essence of the new identity, the firm’s Managing Director, John Obaro, said: “We desire that our name resonates with all our stakeholders—customers, partners, investors, talent, aggregators, regulators, among others—anywhere on the globe as the home of inspired people, innovative solutions, excellent customer service and integrity.”
