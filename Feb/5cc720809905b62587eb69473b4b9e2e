A pupil of IMG Grammar School, Oke-Bola, Ibadan was on Wednesday feared dead while some others were injured during a clash between pupils of the school and those of Oke-Bola Comprehensive High School. Students of the two schools, which are located on the same street, are suspected to be members of rival cult groups, making them clash regularly. A lawyer, whose office is located near the school, told The Nation that the pupils have been clashing daily as from 1:30 pm for several years. He said the pupils started Wednesdayâ€™s clash at about the same time but decided to attack some people whose workshops and offices are near the schools, vandalizing their vehicles. He said they specifically attacked an auto-technician workshop near their school. By the time the attack was over, over 10 vehicles have been vandalized. The eye witness said he expected a reprisal attack from pupils of IMG today (Thursday) having suffered a loss on Wednesday. The victim is thought to be an SS3 student. When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in Oyo State Mr Gbenga Fadeyi, and the Commissioner for Education, Barr. Olasunkanmi Olaleye, were unavailable for comments.
