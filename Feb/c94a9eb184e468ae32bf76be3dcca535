 Unidentified hoodlums have bombed a major trunkline belonging to the Nigerian Agip Oil Company (NAOC) in Bayelsa State. It was gathered that the pipeline linking the Tebidaba flow station at Olugbobiri, Southern Ijaw Local Area, was attacked on Monday night. A source from the community, who spoke in confidence, said the development forced Agip to shut down the major trunkline. He said the pipeline conveys crude oil to Agip terminal at Brass adding that security operations were ongoing to identify and arrest the attackers. It was, however, gathered that some suspects were nabbed by operatives of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC). A source from NSCDC, who spoke in confidence, said the outfit would soon speak in the matter.
