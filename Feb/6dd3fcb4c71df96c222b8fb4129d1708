There is anxiety among hundreds of medical students at the College of Medicine of the University of Ibadan (UI). Patients seeking clinical services at the University College Hospital (UCH) are also apprehensive with the withdrawal of services of over 300 members of the Medical and Dental Consultant Association of Nigeria (MDCAN) at the university and the hospital. MDCAN had declared an indefinite strike on Tuesday to press home its demands for the National Universities Commission (NUC) to withdraw the circular requiring clinical lecturers to acquire a PhD as a condition for career progression in Nigerian universities. The strike, which started yesterday, is taking its toll on the college and the university. Clinical lectures have collapsed, leaving medical students in suspense and despair. MDCAN Chairman at UCH, Dr. Dare Olulana, told reporters that the association was left with no other choice than to withdraw its services from UI with immediate effect. Other doctors at the media briefing included its First National Vice-President, Dr. Victor Makanjuola, representing the National President of MDCAN, Prof Ken Ozoilo; Dr. Olulana; Dr. Dayo Williams, of the Association of Resident Doctors (ARD); MDCAN’s Secretary, Dr. A. Adedapo and medical students from the College of Medicine of UI. “Having held our local chapter’s congress at the UCH in Ibadan, we resolved to comply fully with the directive of our national body – to embark of indefinite withdrawal of our services from the College of Medicine of the University of Ibadan until our demands are met,” he said.
