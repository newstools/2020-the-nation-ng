 THE Katsina State police command on Wednesday paraded a 17-year-old housewife, Rabi Rabi’u, accused of stabbing her husband Shamsu Salisu, 25, to death. The incident was said to have occurred in the village of Almakiyayi in Malumfashi Local Government Area of the state. Police said Rabi attacked her husband with a knife while he slept, stabbing him in several places, including his stomach. It was also gathered that the couple had an altercation before the incident. The command’s spokesman Gambo Isa told newsmen that the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) for Malumfashi division responded to a distress call following the couple’s  disagreement. It is unclear , however, who placed the distress call, whether it was the woman, her husband or a neighbour? Isa said a police team rushed the injured the bleeding man to Malumfashi General Hospital where he was confirmed dead. Police said they have recovered a sharp knife and a bedsheet stained with blood. “Investigation is ongoing,” Isa said. The police also arrested a 30-year-old man Samaila Musa of Yan-Nabayye village in Rimi Local Government Area of the state on the allegation that he constantly chained and tortured his two wives Fatima and Hadiza before having sexual intercourse with them. Isa said the suspect was arrested based on information obtained by an investigative police team that he belonged to a notorious secret cult group. “In the course of investigation, police discovered that the victims have marks and signs of brutalisation on their bodies; they defecate on their bodies while in chains, their hairs were cut for ritual purposes and it was also discovered that the suspect also ground pepper and put in their private parts and eyes during their menstrual periods, among other devilish acts,” Isa said.
