Certain people may see it as a publicity stunt, but it is glaring that Adepeju Olukokun, Founder of Kokun Foundation, is helping the downtrodden. He doesnâ€™t have the affluence of the likes of Aliko Dangote and Femi Otedola, yet he gives out money, food and gift items on a regular basis. On Tuesday, Olukokun shared a video where he presented a lady identified simply as Sandra a Toyota Camry car. Recall that Sandra gained popularity when she joined other Gokada riders to protest the ban on Okada and Keke NAPEP tricycles by the Lagos State government. The footage went viral and caught the attention of the founder of the non-profit organization. The young man, who is in his 30s, has dedicated his time, money and effort to see that people do not go to bed hungry. Regardless of his intention, he deserves some accolades for putting smiles on the faces of Nigeria in his own way.
