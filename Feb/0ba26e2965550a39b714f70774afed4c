 THE Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE) in Osun State has thanked Governor Gboyega Oyetola for pardoning some its members demoted for engaging in studies without approval. It said it would remain grateful to the governor for prioritising  the welfare of workers, especially for paying full workers’ salary promptly and regularly. The state NULGE President, Comrade Jacob Adedeji Adeyeye, spoke with reporters after a vote of confidence was passed in him and his team at a meeting of the state Executive Council at the union’s secretariat in Osogbo. Describing the governor as a bridge builder and a silent achiever, Adeyeye advised NULGE members not to allow “anybody or group of persons to use us to disrupt the peace of the state.”
