Our Reporter Super Eagles ace  midfielder Wilfred Ndidi  said Leicester’s coach  Brendan Rodgers has sparked a bigger improvement in his game than any other manager. The 23-year-old  defensive midfielder has made noticeable progress on the ball this season – with his passing accuracy up four per cent to 84– and he credits Rodgers for providing him with a greater understanding of the game, and with the belief to be positive in possession. “I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again, what I know now, if I’d have known it when I was growing up, I’d have been a better player,”  he said. “I’m grateful to the manager for everything he’s installed in us. “My understanding of the game is much better now. I see the game differently to what I used to. I learned from other managers as well so no disrespect to them, but this manager has made me understand more about the game, like the space available on the pitch.  “I feel like I’ve really improved since I first joined Leicester. Rodgers has given me] the belief and the understanding. That makes it easier when you find yourself in situations on the pitch. When I came to Leicester, I didn’t have much of the ball but now I find myself in situations where I have more time with the ball. That comes from the teaching and the understanding that the manager has given us. “He’s made me understand the role I play and now it’s a case of developing from there.” Ndidi is not just learning on the pitch. He’s studying for a degree in business and tourism management at De Montfort University too. “It’s going well,” Ndidi said of his course. “I did my practical essay recently so I’m just waiting. “I always wanted to study and now I can because I have more time after training. I just want to develop myself away from football. I usually have two lessons a week and I enjoy it.”
