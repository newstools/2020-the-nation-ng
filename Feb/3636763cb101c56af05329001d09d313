Agency Reporter  CHANCELLOR Angela Merkel’s plan for an orderly succession is in ruins and the chances of an early election in Germany have risen after her conservative protegee, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, gave up her ambitions for the top job. Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU) will in the coming months choose who they want to lead the party and run as chancellor in the next federal election, due by October 2021. The same person will probably, but not necessarily, hold both posts. It is too early to forecast how the situation will play out, but following are three possible scenarios. Merkel, an anchor of stability in Europe’s biggest economy during her nearly 15 years in office, has said she will not seek re-election and stood down as party chair in 2018, handing over to Kramp-Karrenbauer.  But with the new possibility of a rival as party leader following Kramp-Karrenbauer’s exit, Merkel might be forced to stand down early, which could prompt her Social Democrat (SPD) coalition partners to walk away and trigger a snap election. Pressure to get the issue sorted out quickly and to have the same person fill both posts could bode ill for Merkel. Leading contenders for the CDU party chair and to be the chancellor candidate of the conservative “Union” alliance, compromising the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, Christian Social Union (CSU), are already circling. Several senior conservatives, including CSU chief Markus Soeder, have urged the CDU to decide on its leadership soon, arguing that dragging out a contest until a party conference in December would hit the Union’s poll ratings.
