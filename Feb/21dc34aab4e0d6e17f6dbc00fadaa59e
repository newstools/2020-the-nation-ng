 THE embattled founder of the Sotitobire Miracle Centre, Oshile, Akure, Alfa Babatunde was on Wednesday absent at the Magistrate Court, Oke-Eda, Akure where he is charged over the missing one-year-old boy Gold Kolawole. The court had sent the cleric back to prison on January 17, pending the issuance of hearing notice over a kidnapping case of the toddler filed against him and five other members of his church by the Department of State services (DSS). The case was adjourned till yesterday but all those who assembled at the Magistrate Court at Oke Eda Akure waited for hours before it was learnt that the case had been shifted to the State High Court. Security men were also seen manning strategic areas at the premises of the court. It was gathered that documents of the case were being perfected for the trial to commence today at the State High Court. The case was earlier mentioned before the magistrate but there was no appearance of all parties in the suit. An official of the court, James Adetoba, said the case would not be holding at the magistrates court. Counsel to Prophet Babatunde, Olusola Oke confirmed that the case had been formally transferred to the High Court which informed why it did not come up yesterday as scheduled. He said the case would begin afresh at the Hgh Court in Akure and assured that his client would be in court to defend himself.
