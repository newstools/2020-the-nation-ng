 THE Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has denied rumour making the rounds about the appointment of former Super Eagles Captain and Coach, Daniel Amokachi as Head of its Technical Department. In a statement on Wednesday, Ademola Olajire, NFF Director of Communications, said Bitrus Bewarang still remained the federation’s Technical Director. Olajire quoted Chairman of the NFF Technical and Development Committee, Alhaji Yusuf Fresh, as saying that at no time did the body call for applications from candidates for that position, not to talk of appointing anyone. “This clarification becomes necessary against the background of wide-circulating, but totally misleading reports of the appointment of Amokachi, a former Super Eagles captain and coach, as head of NFF technical department.” “’The NFF has been bemused by this unfounded story, which no doubt must have embarrassed Amokachi himself,” Fresh said.
