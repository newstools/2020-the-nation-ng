Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Wednesday sought the buy-in of major stakeholders and Nigerians in the water and waste water service provision, to ensure the success of the regulatory guidelines in the water sector. The governor, who spoke at the 2020 Lagos Water Conference held at the Muson Centre, Onikan through the Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr. Tunji Bello, said their buy-in is essential to ensure that the water people are not only safe, but also in a safe environment. He said the call by the administration on stakeholders has become necessary because it is generally accepted that the environmental regeneration programmes in the water sector globally are now regulatory based and no government at any level can do it alone. He said the current water crisis in which almost half of the world’s population had no or insufficient access to clean water appeared to be an everyday occurrence, which was referred to as governance crisis. Sanwo-Olu noted that the people created problems for themselves with the pollution of sources of clean water; unregulated sinking of boreholes; abuse and non-regeneration of water aquifers; possible occurrence of subsidence, among others. He said good water management all over the world is one of the prerequisites of a good governance, adding that at the end of the Dutch Water Governance Centre (WGC) 2011, a brief memorandum in which five elementary building blocks for good water governance was developed. The Minister of Water Resources, Sulaiman Adamu, had said that it was imperative for the state government and Federal Government to synergise in order to ensure that there was provision of potable water for all citizens at all time. The minister, who spoke through the Executive Director, Nigeria Integrated Water Resources Management Commission, Magashi Umar, stressed that the government must ensure the implementation of water regulations law so as to find a solution to the problem in the water sector.
