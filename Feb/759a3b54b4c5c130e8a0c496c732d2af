President Muhammadu Buhari has reiterated the overwhelming importance and critical roles nurses and midwives play in the attainment of Universal Health Coverage (UHC). The president spoke in Abuja during the launch of the “Nursing Now” campaign, organised by the Nursing and Midwifery Council of Nigeria (NMCN), an initiative of the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the International Council of Nurses. The campaign is aimed at raising the profile and status of nursing worldwide. President Buhari explained that practitioners of nursing could help drive the effort to push Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Represented by the Minister of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire, he said: “The theme of this launch “Nurses: From Bedside to Board Room” is fitting because it highlights the link between these core aspects, and emphasizes the need for nurses to be involved in the development of the health system in Nigeria. “This Administration initiated the Basic Health Care Provision Fund (BHCPF), a flagship programme to ensure that vulnerable Nigerians get access to quality and affordable service delivery towards the attainment of Universal Health Coverage (UHC). I am pleased to say we have made good progress with the programme, with our commitment now attracting support from donors and development partners. “The Nursing and Midwifery Council of Nigeria (NMCN) initiated the Community Midwifery Programme to ensure that midwives are retained in their community after training and a fair remuneration is paid. This strategy will provide needed skilled manpower for safe delivery and reduce infant and maternal mortality in rural areas. “Nurses are an integral group in health care delivery, who have the potential to shape the image of their facility or even of the healthcare profession.”
