As part of efforts towards diversifying the nation’s economy to increase Internally Generated Revenue, (IGR), the President of elitist Lagos Country Club, Chief Tajudeen Akande, has called on the Government to revolutionise infrastructural development and address insecurity to boost the tourism sector. Akande, who stated this at the annual New Year party of the club in Lagos recently, noted that tourism industry will not thrive where electricity continues to be epileptic, saying that traffic gridlock is taking valuable time of people as a result of bad road network. The president said, despite God’s given resources to Nigeria which is naturally attractive to tourists across the globe, the sector has been neglected and underdeveloped over the years. Akande described 2019 as year of landmark achievement, owing to a number of projects completed during the year, saying, even when they appeared mission impossible in 2018 when they started them. “As a traveller, I see what tourism looks like elsewhere and what tourism does to the economy of other nations. I am a Nigerian, I have lived all my life here and I know what natural resources such as vegetation, climate and other things that God has given us are the things that naturally attract tourists, but they are not here because they are not developed. Where they are developed, the traffic is not there because of the state of insecurity and infrastructural decay. “For instance if you have a tourist in Lagos who just want to drive round the city to visit places of interest on a city tour, in 45 minutes you should be able to go round the whole of Lagos, but as it is now, it takes the whole day sweating in traffic,” he stressed.
