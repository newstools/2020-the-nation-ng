 Emmanuel Dennis will not take part in Belgian First Division A side Club Brugge’s crucial Europa League round of 32 match against Manchester United at Old Trafford tomorrow. The Super Eagles forward has not sufficiently recovered from an undisclosed injury he suffered in last weekend’s league game vs Sporting Charleroi prompting manager Philippe Clement to omit the 22 year-old from the list of 22 players traveling to Manchester for the second leg tie alongside captain Ruud Vormer. The player who replaced him in the last domestic fixture, compatriot David Okereke, is one of six players classed as strikers named in the travel group and he will compete with Percy Tau, Loïs Openda, Thomas Van Den Keybus, Michael Krmencík and Siebe Schrijvers for a starting shirt in attack. Needing a win or at least a 2-2 draw to progress to the round of 16, Club Brugge are undefeated in the ten matches Dennis has not tasted action this season, winning six and drawing four. The former Zorya Luhansk man has registered four goals in European competitions this term including a memorable brace against Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu in October and opened Club Brugge’s goal account in the reverse fixture last week.
