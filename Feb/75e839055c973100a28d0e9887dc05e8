Violence erupted in the Olomore Market, Abeokuta on Thursday morning as dozens of Hausa traders in the market protested the alleged shooting into their midst by the operatives of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) which allegedly left one  Hausa man dead and  two others injured. The angry traders, who sell onions, pepper, tomatoes, yam and fruits, allegedly went violent, destroying things, including the vehicle of the Ogun State-owned television station and many other properties. The SARS officials were said to have chased some people believed to be ‘Yahoo boys’ towards the market, and fired at them when they ran into them as they made good their escape through the labyrinth of the choked market. The ones in Olomore were soon joined by others from nearby Lafenwa market, who got wind of the shooting and took to the Lafenwa -Abeokuta -Lagos Expressway, disrupting traffic as they marched towards Olomore. They blocked the expressway with bonfires mounted in various locations on the busy road. Many fled in different directions seeking where to hide from harm. Business activities came to an abrupt end even as a detachment of policemen and operatives of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) laboured to keep the violent protest from escalating. Many buses, taxis, private cars whose drivers were caught unawares had their windshields, side mirrors and door glasses smashed. Some motorists abandoned their vehicles on the road and took to their heels. “The people they shot are pepper dealers in Olomore Market,” a trader said. “They are now in the hospital: one of them, Abati, is dead in the hospital. I can’t say whether the other one is dead or not.” Police spokesman  Abimbola Oyeyemi said the victims were alive and not dead, stressing that they are receiving treatment in hospital. Abimbola said the officers implicated in the shooting were operatives of the anti-cultism unit of the Ogun Police Command and not SARS.
