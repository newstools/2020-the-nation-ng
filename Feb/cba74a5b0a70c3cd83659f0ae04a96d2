NIPCO Plc has approved the appointment of Suresh Kumar as the new managing director of the company. According to the Assistant General Manager, Corporate Affairs, NIPCO, Mr. Lawal Taofeek, Kumar replaces Sanjay Teotia, now the Managing Director, NIPCO Gas Limited, with the mandate to drive NIPCO’s operations and expansion moves across the country, adding that the appointment took effect from February 1. Also appointed into the executive management cadre of the company is Roka Chiranjibi, who doubles as the Chief Operating Officer as well as Chief Finance Officer. He was formerly the chief finance officer of the company. Kumar has been a key member of NIPCO’s top management for about 15 years, serving as immediate past chief operating officer. Suresh, who has over two decades’ experience, has worked with two managing directors. He is expected to propel the organisation with innovative ways in its quest for continuous growth. The new managing director has been a major driving force in the entire operations of the company, especially in his last position as COO, which seems to have prepared him for the task as well as making him a natural next-in-line to pilot the company to greater heights. The appointments are geared towards increasing the stake of the company, especially at the retail end of the business to maximise the  benefits in the downstream sector of the industry. On his appointment, Suresh pledged to run an open administration with top notch management of resources in the interest of stakeholders. He praised the outgoing MD, describing him as a guru whose wealth of experience would give the company more fillip.
