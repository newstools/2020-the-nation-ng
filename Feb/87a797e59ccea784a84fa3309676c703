Lagos State Government on Wednesday took possession of the four theatres built at locations. It said that the theatres would provide a befitting place for young and up-and-coming artistes and performers to nurture their talents and compete favourably with their contemporaries globally. The Commissioner for Tourism, Arts and Culture, Mrs. Uzamat AkinbiIe-Yusuf, who spoke at the handing over of the theatres by the project contractor, Terra Kulture Studio Ltd, at Alausa, Ikeja, said: “These theatres now provide a place for grooming our young talents and up-and-coming artistes. By giving these younger ones a place to display and showcase their talents, we are indirectly contributing to the growth of their careers and areas of interest.” She said that the choice of Terra Kulture Studio Ltd for the construction works followed the impeccable track records of the company among other household names in the art and culture industry. Akinbile-Yusuf, a pharmacist, said the government would explore the tourism potentials of the state and enhance its economic gains for the benefits of residents. Finance Commissioner Mr. Rabiu Olowo said that the theatres would contribute to the state’s revenue. He said the project was executed to the specifications of the government, adding that the theatres had been inspected and certified fit for public use. The Managing Director of Terra Kulture Studio Ltd, Mrs. Bolanle Austen-Peters, thanked the government for its commitment towards making the project realisable and delivered in time. She hoped that the building of the theatres at locations across the state would decentralise tourism focus from Lagos Island to other parts of the state.
