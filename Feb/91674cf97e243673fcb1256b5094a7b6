By Olalekan Okusan  As the only Nigerian player seeded among the 32-man seeding list, Olajide Omotayo will lead the country’s contingent to the ITTF Challenge Plus Portugal Open which serves off today. Apart from Omotayo who will start his campaign from the main draw, the trio of Bode Abiodun, Ismaila Akindiya and Taiwo Mati will start their quest for places in the elite division form the first round of preliminary. Abiodun will slug it out against Scotland’s Niall Cameron; Akindiya will take on Switzerland’s Lars Posch while Mati will confront Guyana’s Miguel Wong. Tomorrow, Ganiat Aruna and Edem Offiong will be campaigning in the women’s singles from the first round of preliminary with Aruna taking on Italy’s Giorgia Piccolin, while Offiong tackles Kazakhstan’s Anastassiya Lavrova. In the men’s doubles, Mati and Nurudeen Hassan will be partnering and they are expected to face India’s Jeet Chandra and Snehit Suravajjula. Omotayo and Bode will take on Ukraine’s Yevhen Pryshchepa and Yaroslav Zhmudenko in the first round of preliminary.  Following the late withdrawal of Aruna Quadri, Egypt’s Omar Assar has been upgraded to number one seed in the seeding list as three African players are listed in the seeding list. Apart from Assar and Omotayo, Senegal’s Ibrahima Diaw who is competing in his first tournament in 2020 is seeded 19 ahead of Omotayo rated 22. For Omotayo, the tournament serves as the final rehearsal for the back-to-back tournaments holding later this month in Tunisia. “I am hoping that competing in this kind of competition will put me in good shape for the ITTF Africa Top 16 Cup and the Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Tunisia. There is no doubt that the quality of players heading to Tunisia are the best Africa can assemble and I am going there as contender and not competitor. Being my first time in the two competitions and I hope to my presence felt in Tunisia,” he added.
