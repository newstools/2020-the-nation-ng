 The Edo State Government, in collaboration with Neko Boli Production Limited will in May, 2019, host youths across the state’s 18 Local Government Areas (LGAs) to a football competition, as part of efforts by the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led administration to galvanize youths to efficiently contribute to the development of the state. The Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Hon. Monday Osaigbovo, disclosed this when he received the Manager of Neko Boli Production Ltd, Joshua Shaapara, on a courtesy visit at his office in Benin City. The commissioner who was represented by Princess Margret Jos-Bazuaye, Acting Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, said it was an opportunity to spot young talents and groom them to be superstars. “Our youths are future leaders; so we owe it as a duty to groom them and get them occupied with the activities they have passion for,” he said. He added that the initiative was also in line with the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led administration’s programmes aimed at empowering youths and building their capacities to compete favourably with their colleagues in other parts of the world. Earlier, Shaapero said the football competition is tagged ‘Obaseki and Shaibu Intra -Local Government Peace and Unity Cup 2020’, with the theme, ‘Edo youths, come let’s play.’ She assured that the tournament would efficiently engage the youths and make them productive, thereby reducing in the spate of crime in the state. “We decided to use this platform to mobilize support for his Excellency, Governor Obaseki’s re-election, and also engage the youths with the loving game of football to discover new talents,” she added.
