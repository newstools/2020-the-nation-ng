But for the timely intervention by fire fighters from the Lagos State Fire Service (LSFS), there would have been another fire disaster on Wednesday at the Secretariat, Alausa, Ikeja. There was a fire outbreak in the morning at the Nigeria Police Station, Rapid Response Squad (RRS) office at the Secretariat, Alausa, Ikeja, with heavy smoke billowing out of the building, which is situated close to the Bagauda Kaltho Press Centre, the office of the correspondents covering the Governorâ€™s Office. The fire caused pandemonium, with officers running helter-skelter as well as civil servants from the neighbouring offices, trying to put out the fire. But the situation was brought under control by the timely arrival of the Lagos State Fire Service officials, whose office is also at Alausa, about three poles away from the fire scene. LSFS was able to quench the fire within a short time with the single firefighting truck it came with and other gadgets in the building and surrounding offices used by the civil servants. At press time, the cause of the fire was yet to be ascertained, but it is suspected to have been caused by power surge. Officers were evacuated from the building and no casualty was recorded.
