Our Reporter  A new reality television show, ‘Date My Family Nigeria’, has berthed. The reality dating show involves a suitor/suitress going on a dinner date with three different families/friends of potential dates they are yet to meet. Eventually, the suitor or suitress must choose a date based on their experience with the date’s family members. With five episodes done, Date My Family Nigeria, will air on Africa Magic Showcase on Sundays at 06:30pm (WAT) with repeat episodes on Fridays, same channel at 5:30pm.  In the olden days in Nigeria, it was common practice for couples to go through some form of matching making. It was not strange to see two fathers and in some cases, mothers too, decide to bring their families together as a great idea to unite and further consolidate the bond between both families. The children get married and the rest is history. In our contemporary era, there are hook ups and introductions that take place daily. Friends introduce each other to their other friends; family members introduce members of their families that are single to other eligible bachelors and spinsters. Some of these relationships sometimes end up as happily ever after; which is oftentimes the main goal.
