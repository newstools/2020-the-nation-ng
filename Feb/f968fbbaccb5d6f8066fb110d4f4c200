Kehinde OLULEYE  THE Football Association will limit how often young players can head balls in training, to address growing health fears. An outright ban is not expected, rather a reduction in how many times players under 18 can head the ball, according to reports. It comes after mounting pressure on the English football’s governing body to acknowledge research linking moderate traumatic brain injury – such as that caused by heading the ball – and a higher risk of developing dementia. Last October, a landmark study found that professional footballers have a much-increased risk of dying from dementia and other serious neurological diseases. It prompted plans from The Scottish Football Association to completely ban primary school children in Scotland from heading the ball. The FA said at the time there was not enough evidence to change its stance, but appear to have backtracked. The FA confirmed to MailOnline they are finalising to confirm its plans later this month. The guidance will vary for different ages. The change comes after talks with the Scottish FA, The Times reported. Many officials and sports players believe a limit on heading is a necessary precaution in light of existing research. October’s study, which was funded by the FA and the PFA, the player’s union, showed that former players are three-and-a-half times more likely to die of dementia than normal people of the same age. The 22-month ‘FIELD study’, conducted by the University of Glasgow’s brain injury group, also found a five-fold increase in the risk of Alzheimer’s, a four-fold increase in motor neurone disease and a two-fold increase in Parkinson’s.
