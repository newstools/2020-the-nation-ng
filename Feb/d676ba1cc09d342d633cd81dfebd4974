  THE Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Ekiti State Government on the construction of the Ado-Ekiti-Ilupeju and Ado- Ekiti-Ijesha Ishu 132/33kV transmission line and associated 2x60MVA 132/33kV substations at Ilupeju and Ijesha Ishu within the state.  Governor Kayode Fayemi, represented by his deputy, Otumba Bisi Egbeyemi, expressed delight that the MoU would result in new transmission lines as well as two new substations that would help improve the poor electricity supply.
