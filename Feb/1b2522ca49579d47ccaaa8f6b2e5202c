 THE proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has vowed to resist any attempt by bandits and other criminal elements to attack any part of the Southeast and Southsouth. It urged the people of “Biafraland” to prepare to defend themselves against attacks. IPOB Media and Publicity Secretary Emma Powerful condemned the January 10 attack on Delta State Police Command personnel, who were on a stop-and-search duty in Asaba. The incident occurred around 9 pm at the popular Abraka Market area of Asaba and left about three policemen with varying degrees of injury. Their rifles were reportedly taken away by the bandits. Gunmen had also attacked Avwon, Agadama, Ohoror and other communities in Uwheru Kingdom, Ughelli North Local Government Areas of the state. At least, eight persons were killed while several others sustained injuries. IPOB said the killings were “premeditated slaughter of the defenceless.” “IPOB’s message of freedom is the only way out of the present impasse in the fight against terrorism in Nigeria,” he said. The group said it would resist every attempt by herdsmen to unleash terror on “Biafraland”. “Therefore, we are calling on our people to be prepared because we are going to take on terrorists in our land,” IPOB said.
