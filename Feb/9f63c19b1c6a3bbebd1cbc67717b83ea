 Every February 21 is set aside to celebrate the international mother-tongue day. It is a day to celebrate our indigenous languages, promoting its awareness and diversity. It was first announced in 1999 by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and has since been recognised annually. Sadly, our indigenous languages have been neglected due to modernisation. Our indigenous languages remain the most powerful way to preserve and develop culture and to promote it all across the world showing who we are and where we come from. There are several reasons why we should speak and promote our mother tongue. A few of them are:  1. Pride:  Knowing and speaking our mother tongue well gives us a sense of pride. It boosts our confidence and creates awareness in our mind while also helping us connect with our cultural identity better.. 2. Intellectual Development:  Some people grow intellectually with their mother-tongue more than they do with foreign languages. Indigenous language helps boost knowledge base of individuals. 3. Connection with Culture:  Our indigenous language helps to keep our culture alive. It helps to remember our roots. 4. Private Connectivity:  Indigenous language is sometimes helpful in shutting out unwanted interruptions from unwanted persons, especially if in a foreign land. It symbolizes the difference between people.
