Senator Ishaku Abbo of Adamawa North Zone has aligned with Reformed PDP (R-PDP), the breakaway faction of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Adamawa State. Speaking on a radio programme on Monday, Abbo alleged that the “political rigmarole being experienced in the party” is due to injustices meted on some party chieftains and their supporters during congresses. He said refusal to address the squabble in the PDP informed the formation of the R-PDP. According to Abbo: “The fact is that a political party like us is supposed to belong to everyone, especially loyal members as they all contributed in its making from the scratch. “But in a situation where after victory at the polls, then someone is using his position to enforce his principles on other party members, resistance becomes inevitable.” Abbo affirmed his support for the ‘Ardo’s faction’ (R-PDP), stressing that the R-PDP was on the right track. The R-PDP had since its formation last year been associated with a former PDP governorship candidate, Dr Umar Ardo, as its brain box but after some processes, the R-PDP formally inaugurated executive committees last week with one Alhaji Hammajoda Girei as the state chairman. Monday’s radio outburst by Sen Ishaku Abbo conforms to his long known stance of being in the opposition within his party. He had since last year been drawn in a battle with Governor Ahmadu Fintiri, whom he accused severally of predetermining PDP candidates for the local council election which took place in the 21 local government areas of the state on December 7, 2019. The R-PDP may therefore have had his blessings since the other aggrieved PDP members had been planning it last year.
