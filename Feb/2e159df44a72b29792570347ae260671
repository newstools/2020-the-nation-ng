 THE Chairman of Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE), Ifako-Ijaiye Local Government chapter, Mr. David Kayode Folorunso, has said what the Acting Chairman of the local government, Usman Akanbi Hamzat, facilitated was the payment of improved welfare and the prompt payment of Christmas bonus to all categories of workers. He said the clarification became necessary following misrepresentation in some quarters regarding the payment. Folorunso said there was no truth in the story that the acting chairman paid 13th month salary to workers in the local government. “What the acting local government chairman did for us was improving our welfare package and the payment of Christmas bonus to all cadres of workers, which ensured that we all had a happy Yuletide.” Praising the acting chairman for his administrative success and landmark initiatives since his assumption of office, Folorunso said it is clear from the steps taken by the council’s new leadership that the council is heading for greater heights. He pledged that workers in the employ of the council were committed to the success of the council and the greater strides of the acting chairman. Hamzat had thanked God for the successes recorded by the council in the previous year, and commended the workers and management for their commitment to the objective of the administration.
