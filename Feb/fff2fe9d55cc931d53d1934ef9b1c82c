 DESPITE retaining her title to move up in the world ranking, Nigeria’s Odunayo Adekuoroye has said that the victory at the African Championships in Algeria has put her in good frame of mind for Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games in Japan. Adekuoroye garnered 18 points for claiming gold in Algeria and move to the top of the world rankings in the women’s 57kg with 61 points, one point ahead of former number one Kawai Risako of Japan (60pts). An excited Adekuoroye told NationSport from Algiers yesterday that competing in the tournament with top athletes has added to her experience and put her in vantage position for Tokyo 2020. “It was not easy for me in Algeria because I did not underrate my opponents. I trained seriously for every competition although I knockout everyone in my category because I prepared well to retain my title,” she said. She added: “Even if you win a gold medal in every competition, you are still susceptible to mistake. So there is always a lesson for an athlete in every competition. I need matches before the Olympics and at least I got four matches in Algeria and this is good for me.” Meanwhile, Team Nigeria at the weekend won a record 9th consecutive title in Women’s Wrestling at the African Championships, claiming six gold and four silver medals. Apart from Adekuoroye who shot to the top of the world ranking, Blessing Oborududu (68kg) also rose to number two in the global rating. Mercy Genesis (50kg), teen sensation Esther Kolawole (55kg), Adekuoroye, Bisola Makunjuola (59kg), Hannah Reuben (65kg) and Oborududu, who won a 10th straight African title in a row, were all impressive as they accounted for Nigeria’s gold medals, while defending champions Blessing Onyebuchi (76kg) and teenager Sunmisola Balogun, who moved up to 72kg from 65kg, as well as former champions Aminat Adeniyi (62kg) and Bose Samuel (53kg) settled for silver.
