The Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdulrosheed Akanbi, has said he will abide by the suspension given to him by the Osun State Traditional Rulers’ Council last Friday. The monarch was suspended after an emergency meeting by the council presided over by the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi. The council also banned Oluwo from attending its meetings on the grounds that he disrespected Ooni of Ife, Alake of Egbaland and Alaafin of Oyo. A statement issued yesterday in Osogbo by the Chief Press Secretary to Oluwo, Alli Ibraheem expressed regrets about the face-off between Oluwo of Iwo and Agbowu of Ogbaagba. The statement reads:  “The Oluwo-in-Council regrets the unfortunate incident that transpired between the Agbowu of Ogbaagbaa and Oluwo of Iwo last week. “We will like to put it on record that the Oluwo did not at any time assault the Agbowu or any other Oba for that matter. However, we respect the decision of the Osun State Council of Obas to suspend the Oluwo from the Council of Oba’s meetings. Although the suspension was harsh and undeserved, the Oluwo will abide by it. “Once again, we express our gratitude and respect to the Council of Obas and the leadership under the imperial majesty, the Ooni of Ife, Oba Enitan Ogunwusi.”
