A woman Mrs Fatimah Jimoh on Thursday prayed an Area Court in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital, to nullify her marriage of eight years to Amosa on the ground that he beat her and did not provide food for her and their four children. The petitioner alleged that her husband beat her for no just reason. “My husband beats me every time. Every argument will prompt him to beat me. “He does not provide money for feeding. He is not taking care of me and the children. He is not playing his fatherly role as expected, ‘ she told the court. She also prayed the court to grant her custody of the four children and sought an order of court compelling Amosa to pay N20,000 monthly as feeding allowance for the children. The defendant was absent from court to respond to the allegation. The Presiding Judge, Mr Abdulhameed Aliyu adjourned the case until March 25, for continuation of hearing and for the defendant to appear in court.
