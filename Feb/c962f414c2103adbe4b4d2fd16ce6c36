Three heavy-duty vehicles laden with goods on Wednesday crashed at the Obosi, Anambra State end of the  Owerri-Onitsha Expressway. One person was confirmed dead, while six were seriously injured. The crash caused a prolonged traffic snarl around the Obosi flyover where it happened about 6.30am. State Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) Andrew Kumapayi said the injured were rushed to hospital, while the remains of the dead were deposited at the mortuary. Kumapayi said, “Three vehicles and six male adults were involved in the crash which claimed the life of one person while three others sustained different degrees of injuries. “The vehicles involved were Daf truck with registration number NNE733XA, an Iveco truck with registration number RRN733XA and a Dangote truck, whose plate number was removed before the arrival of FRSC rescue team.” Kumapayi said the crash, which occurred could be attributed to speeding and loss of control. “Before we got there, the injured victims had been rushed to hospital and the body deposited at the mortuary by a Good Samaritan,” he said. Kumapayi also said that the clearing of obstruction was ongoing at the scene of the crash. The FRSC chief condoled with the family of the dead and wished the injured victims speedy recovery. The FRSC official advised all road users to always call the Corps emergency toll-free number 122, in the event of any emergency for prompt response to victims of road traffic crashes. The sector commander admonished motorists in the state to drive with care and desist from speeding, wrongful overtaking and all forms of dangerous driving.
