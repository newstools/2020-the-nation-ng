 The National Youth Service Corps(NYSC), on Wednesday, raised alarm over the activities of certain individuals who placed online advertisement claiming to specialize in deployment and redeployment of Corps members to the state of their choices. The NYSC warned prospective graduates and those already mobilised not to pay money to anyone in person or by account for the purpose of deployment or redeployment, as they might be doing so at their own risk. The scheme, in a statement signed by the Coordinator, Southwest Area Office, Mr Emmanuel Attah said, “the National Headquarters in Abuja is already investigating the unscrupulous people behind the scam, with an assurance that upon arrest their prosecution would be made public. The statement read, ” the activities being currently circulated online in a soft copy flier with the title “Henroozy Koncept” is fraudulent and criminal. “National Youth Service Corps had never authorised any group, organization or individual to perform such function or any other functions related to the NYSC mobilisation. “Deployment and redeployment were done exclusively by the NYSC, based on statutory provision and in compliance with Federal Character, Unity and peaceful coexistence of Nigeria.” He disclosed that the scheme’s National Headquarters in Abuja was already investigating the unscrupulous people behind the scam, with an assurance that upon arrest their prosecution would be made public. Mr Attah appealed to parents and guardians of graduates of tertiary institutions to desist from the practice of trying to come through the back door as such attract the wrath of the law if caught.a
