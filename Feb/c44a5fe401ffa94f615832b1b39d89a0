The Network on Police Reform in Nigeria, NOPRIN, has again condemned the spate of extra-judicial killings in the country, calling on the federal government to issue official statement condemning the act. Speaking at a press conference which coincided with the International Day for Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation in Lagos during the week, the NOPRIN National Coordinator, Emmanuel Ikule, said it is an opportunity to again “call together everyone to direct our cries to the government about the state of affairs in Nigeria before we lose our voice and there is no one to mourn.” Ikule said Section 33(1) of the 1999 constitution, states that “Every person has a right to life, and no one shall be deprived intentionally of his life, except in execution of the sentence of a court in respect of a criminal offence of which he has been found guilty in Nigeria.” In the light of what he described as “an increase in extra-judicial killings,” the NOPRIN coordinator said “the call for reform of the SARS unit of the Nigeria Police Force can no longer be easily disregarded.” He therefore called on the highest authorities to demonstrate their total opposition to the trend “by making it clear to all members of the police, military and other security forces that extra-judicial executions will no longer be tolerated under any circumstance.” He also recommended “strict chain of command control”, restraints for officers, such that use of force is only applied when it becomes ‘strictly necessary,’ police protection against death threats, prohibition of secret detention, compensation for dependants of victims, amongst others.
