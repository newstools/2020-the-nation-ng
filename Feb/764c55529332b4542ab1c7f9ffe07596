Carriers in the West African Sub-region could save over $100 million if they patronise indigenous firm with speciality in aircraft interior furnishing, Chief Executive Officer, Seven Star Global Hangar, Isaac Balami has disclosed. Balami said the huge cost spent by Nigerian and West African carriers offshore in aircraft interiors refurbishment could be saved at home to develop the industry and economy. According to him, indigenous firms striking the right partnership could provide aircraft interiors refurbishment services at domestically, sourcing quality materials rather than going overseas for such services. Balami argued that with over 150 private jets in the country, there is sufficient market to be explored by firms involved in aircraft interiors refurbishment. He said recent partnership between Seven Star Global Hangar and Santos Aviation in delivering aircraft refurbishment would create employment for several youths as well as reduce capital flight. Stakeholders believe that the partnership between these firms is a value addition to the aviation sector as it will serve as a boost to indigenous capacity in aircraft interiors refurbishment. This is aside the reasoning that it will attract other airlines from other West African countries to Nigeria for patronage. For instance, it is believed that the partnership portends big business for the Nigerian economy. This is because jet owners who hitherto take their interior refurbishing countries like Canada, South Africa and America now have an option of doing same domestically, thereby saving the country a lot of money in form of capital flight.
