Agency Reporter English Premiership League (EPL) fans have taken to social media to express their feelings about the new Super Eagles Jersey launched last week. The Nigerian football Federation (NFF) released the freshly designed jerseys for the Super Eagles 2022 World Cup campaign. The new “Swoosh” design by Nike was inspired by Nigerian traditional attires and local fabrics which are expected to rival the previous design which broke record sales leading to the 2018 World Cup in Russia. With English fans being fed up with boring, methodical football kit designs, Nike have confirmed that they are ‘ditching’ their football kit templates for next season, with each club in its roster getting a fresh look of its own. The American sports manufacture currently has three EPL teams on its portfolio, with Liverpool joining Chelsea, Tottenham and Brighton for next season. A twitter handle, Liverpool Offside, tweeted: “I don’t know how Nigeria keep getting kits that are a billion times better than the rest of Nike’s template but here’s hoping whoever is doing it for them is in charge of Liverpool’s 20-21 kit.” Nike’s Senior Director of Global Communications Heidi Burgett confirmed that each club within the Nike portfolio would be given a bespoke kit design for the 2020-21 season. She tweeted: “We’re ditching the templates. For the 2020 kits, Nike designers had 65 chassis options available to them across varying necklines, sleeves, cuffs, badge placement, etc. From hand-drawn prints to custom fonts, each team’s look will be its own.”
