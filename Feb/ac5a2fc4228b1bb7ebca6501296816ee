 An official of the Lagos State Traffic Management Agency (LASTMA)  has allegedly committed  suicide. The body of the official simply identified as Akinde was seen dangling on a tree lifeless. He was said to have allegedly hung himself on advertising billboard at Opebi near the popular Adebola House. None of the sympathisers could say what led to the action. The Nation learnt that he was recently redeployed from his Alausa base to Ijora but was not happy about the redeployment. A source close to the late Akinde said he was battling with mental illness. The Nation learnt that he suffered the illness in the line of duty. The source described the incident as tragic. “We don’t know what could have led to the incident. He was working at Alausa before his new posting. He did not hide his intention of not being happy with the posting. Though, he was suffering from mental illness. I think only those closer to him knew that. He was not married. It was a big tragedy for the LASTMA family,” the source said. Another source said she saw the late Akinde last week. “I can’t recollect where I saw him. Maybe around his new post area in Ijora. He once trekked from Lagos to Sagamu. LASTMA management sent people to bring him back to Lagos and was made to undergo treatment. His death is painful,” she said. Efforts to get LASTMA General Manager and Chief Public Affairs Officer were unsuccessful. Both men did not pick their calls and were yet to return the calls as at the time of going to press.
