Italian club Sampdoria are the latest club interested in signing Club Brugge forward Emmanuel  Dennis. However, Sampdoria’s offer is less than half of what Club Brugge want for the forward. Dennis, 22, who has a contract with Brugge till 2022, has also been linked with Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund as well as several Premier League clubs. Dennis would have been featuring in the French Ligue 1 for either Nice or Rennes this season, but opted to stay put at Club Brugge because he liked the new coach at the Belgian team. Last season, Dennis had announced he wanted to quit Belgium and he could have joined either Nice or Rennes, who submitted bids for him. However, he eventually opted out a move to France after he declared he like new coach Philippe Clement. Club Brugge were then happy to give him a new contract in September that will run till 2022. But the Super Eagles forward, 22, now looks set to finally be on his way out of Belgium in the summer. Club Brugge hope they can now cash on this transfer after valuing him between 25 and 30 million Euros.
