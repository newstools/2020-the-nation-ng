With Victor Akande  Top act, Patrick Osagie Osakue, massively addressed as P.Voo in the beats circuit, is set to return in grand style with re-defined galala brand of music. However, he sought to create sounds that danceable and youth-friendly. To achieve this, he said he had to source different materials, including his wife and 11 year old son, both of whom he maintain have good ears for music.  “I have since learnt over the years in my musical career through various interactions with both stakeholders in music and none that nobody is a repository of knowledge,” he maintained. “So, when you are looking for something that people will embrace and applaud, such should be your attitude when researching.” Satisfied with the level of his creative output, he took the work to Chief Eloka Agbasime aka Oga di Oga who listened to his songs and certified them commercial enough. Based on his conviction, he signed on P.Voo. The album, according to P.voo would not only return him to the center stage, it would also be a reference point in music making.
