 THE National President, Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA), Saratu Aliyu on Thursday disclosed that 23 million Nigerians are presently unemployed. According to the National Bureau of Statistic (NBS) data on unemployment of  2010-2019, unemployed Nigerians in 2010 stood at 3.5 million, increased to 21 million in 2018 and by 2019 it had hit 23million. The NACCIMA President disclosed this during the graduation ceremony of 316 students of the Model Skills Training Centre in Abuja, stating that unemployment portends great danger for any country. She maintained that businesses across the country suffer from talent shortage, which she said is  evident in the growing demand for expatriates to sustain production across various sectors. The Director General, Industrial Training Fund (ITF), Joseph Ari said “I am elated because we have finally successfully achieved what we had set out to do in 2008, despite the numerous hiccups that littered the ways.” He said the graduands  have been imparted with the right skills, knowledge and values to be work-ready, world ready and future ready.
