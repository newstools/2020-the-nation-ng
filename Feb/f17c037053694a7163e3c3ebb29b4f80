They were also accused of taking possession of N36.8m “which you reasonably ought to have known that such funds form part of proceeds of an unlawful act to wit: stealing.” Justice Mohammed Liman made the order following their plea of not guilty to a three-count charge. The judge adjourned till February 19 to hear their bail application following an application by their counsel, Olumide Esan. The suspects were arraigned by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). EFCC counsel Anselem Ozioko told Justice Liman that the defendants conspired with a firm, ISD Technology Limited; and one Solo, said to be at large, to commit the offences sometime in 2017 in Lagos. He said they acted contrary to Sections 27(1Hb) and 10 of the Cybercrimes (Prohibition, Prevention etc) Act, 2015 and were liable to be punished under the same section of the Act.
