The Senator representing Niger East Senatorial District, Senator Mohammed Sani Musa has cried out over renewed bandit attacks on some communities in Niger State, saying that his people are being attacked by bloodthirsty barbarians. He said the fresh attacks came as the people were settling down after President Muhammadu Buhari promised to intervene. On Saturday, bandits attacked Gurmana and adjoining communities in Shiroro Local Government Area as well as other local government areas of the state. Sani Musa said, “I received the news of the attacks early  Saturday from members of the communities who escaped by the whiskers. “This is so bad. Just when we thought the banditry attacks were coming to an end with the intervention of President Muhammadu Buhari, another bizarre attack by bloodthirsty people happened. “My heart is heavy, and I find it really unbelievable that people could just be so ungodly to the point that the sanctity of human life no longer means anything to them. “According to the information I got, armed men dressed in black clothes shouting “Allahu Akhbar” stormed Gurmana and other adjoining communities and started shooting rapidly. “Three persons were confirmed to have been killed while many are lying critically injured at the Kuta General Hospital.”
