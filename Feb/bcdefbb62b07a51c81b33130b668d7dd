Teams from the Force Headquarters and the 12 Zonal Commands of the Nigeria Police have arrived in Anambra for the 12th Nigerian Police Games which will begin today. Frank Mba, the Force Public Relations Officer, disclosed this on Friday at the Alex Ekwueme Square in Awka, venue of the opening ceremony. Mba, a Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) said that the athletes were battle-ready, and the Games promised to be successful and memorable. He said all the Games officials, as well as scouts lined up to spot budding and exceptional talents during the Games, had also arrived. “We have about 3,000 athletes already, all from the 12 zones and the Force Headquarters which is competing as a zone. They are all represented in the ongoing parade rehearsal. “We also have all the officials and technical people, including non-police officials. “These non-police officials are the professionals from the various national sports federations as well as those for the talent hunt, led by a great sports ambassador, Mary Onyali, who is a daughter of Anambra. “So, as it is now, we are satisfied with the level of readiness of the facilities for the various events in spite of the fact that some of them are undergoing finishing touches,” Mba said. He said the Police were hopeful that the facilities would be ready for their events, and assured that there were ready alternatives if the ones still under construction were not ready. “We are good to go. Overall, 90 percent of the facilities are ready. “Even at the biggest stage of world’s sports, be it Olympics, football World Cup or cricket World Cup, provided it is a massive sports event, you keep putting finishing touches even when the competition is ongoing.’’ The DCP acknowledged that there were some events whose facilities were still being prepared, assuring that they would soon be ready.
