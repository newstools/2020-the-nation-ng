The traditional ruler of Assa Community HRH, Eze Emmanuel Assor told journalists that following his intervention, the youths have started returning the looted properties belonging to Lee Establishment Facility in the area. The monarch said he personally saw some of the returned properties, confirmed that there was absolute peace in his domain following his quick intervention and other leaders in the community He said: “I had to address the youths of my community after the incident and I tried to remind them of the need to be law abiding. I let them understand that taking laws into their own hands has never solved any problem, rather, it worsens situation. “I equally had to remind them that neither Shell Company nor Lee Engineering Company caused the death of the deceased. So, I’m glad the youths saw reasons with me and started calming down. That’s where we are today”, the monarch said. Describing the death of his subjects as unfortunate, Asor said that he has already visited the two deceased families to console them. While calling on the Company to actively participate in the burial of their two workers and see ways to cushion the effect of their death,  the royal father pointed out that discussion was still ongoing on the payment of compensation to the deceased families.
