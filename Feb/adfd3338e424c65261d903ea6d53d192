By Collins Nweze  The Coca-Cola Foundation (TCCF), through the New World Programme (NWP), has given a grant of $100,000 to the Mental and Environmental Development Initiative for Children (MEDIC) for implementing a Recycling Scheme for Women and Youth Empowerment (RESWAYE). The move aligns with the firm’s plan to further express its commitment to empowering women, youths and building sustainable communities. The Coca-Cola Company recognises the challenge of plastic waste disposal in the world, including in Nigeria. The company is running a World Without Waste programme, which seeks to not only educate people on waste disposal but also to work with relevant stakeholders such as MEDIC to improve plastic waste disposal and recycling procedure. Public Affairs, Communications & Sustainability Manager, Coca-Cola Nigeria, Nwamaka Onyemelukwe said: “What RESWAYE does is it focuses on two crucial passion points for us at Coca-Cola which are women’s empowerment and sustainable waste management.  We recognise the importance of preserving our environment and we are passionate about empowering women to reach their full potential. For this reason, we are excited to be partnering with MEDIC on this.” Founder of MEDIC, Doyinsola Ogunye said: “We have been working in this community for over five years, but mostly with the children. With RESWAYE, we are empowering the women to not only give occupy them but to also equip them enough to provide for and take care of their families. This launch is a historic event because this is the first ever network of women who recycle in Nigeria and we cannot be more proud.” Nwamaka Onyemelukwe said: “We are proud to partner with them on the RESWAYE to tackle Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 13, 14, and 15, which are: Climate Action, Life Underwater, and Life on Land. RESWAYE seeks to empower self-motivated women and young people who are ready to make a positive change in their environment.”
