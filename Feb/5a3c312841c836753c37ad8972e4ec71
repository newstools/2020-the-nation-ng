Managing Director, Ecobank Nigeria, Patrick Akinwuntan has said food security is critical, as it enhances national security, and to ensure our continuous survival as a country, we must put agriculture in the front burner. Speaking at the Ecobank Agribusiness Summit in Lagos, the bank chief said it was an initiative to create a common platform that brings together partakers in the agric value chain, be it producers, processors, logistics entrepreneurs, insurance practitioners and others within the sector to think a better approach to agriculture sustainability for Nigeria. ”Agriculture is not just a culture, it is a business. Historically, agriculture used to be the lead within the economy, before the advent of petroleum, now, we understand that the long term sustainability of the economy can only come from agriculture, because of its ability to create employment for the teeming young population and its ability to integrate all the parts of the country. When it is agriculture, there is no North, West, South and East, it is all about where do I get the best item, best quality, best value. In addition, given the landscape in Nigeria, given  the population within Nigeria, we are a natural market and so when you look at what the government and the central bank has been promoting in the last four to five years, a lot of focus have been  on supporting Agric as a means to reduce the import bill of Nigeria and ultimately increase the export revenues of Nigeria.”
