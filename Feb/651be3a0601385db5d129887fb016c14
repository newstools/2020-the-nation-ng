Sanni Onogu, Abuja Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, has condemned what he described as attempt to return the country to a regional system of government. Lawan, who spoke while paying tribute to late Senator Benjamin Uwajumogu, in Abuja, said the Senate will continue to work to ensure a united country. He said that the late Uwajumogu worked for a country where citizens can live freely, their ethnicity or religion notwithstanding. Lawan said: “Ben was something else, when there was crisis he would preach that we should unite and that we are one as a Senate. “He remained the same person up to the last day he contributed to his last debate which has been referred by our colleagues. “In that debate, he urged the government to stand up for her citizens wherever they may live. “He has left but he has left something for us – humanity. There is nothing more important for us than working for Nigeria. “I want to assure Nigerians that the National Assembly will remain focused for the sole purpose of ensuring that our citizens get the best deal from their legislature at this level. “We will continue to work to ensure that there is improvement on security and lives of Nigerians. “We will ensure that Nigerians live where they choose to live and are protected. “We want to ensure that there is serious unity among Nigerians. The recent tendencies of going back to regionalism and provincial tendencies will not take Nigeria anywhere. “When we have serious confrontation, we face them as a united people. “Finally, I want to pray that the may the soul of our colleague Benjamin Uwajumogu rest in perfect peace, Amen”
