Our Reporter Several parishioners of Saints Peter and Paul Catholic Church, Lagere, Ile-Ife in Osun State, wept yesterday during the requiem mass and burial of six members of the church. The deceased died on Sunday morning in an accident at Eripa, near Iree, while returning from the annual pilgrimage to Oke Maria, Otan Ayegbaju in Boluwaduro Local Government. They were buried at the church’s cemetery at Mayfair, Ile-Ife, after the requiem mass. The departed souls comprising four women and two men are: Patrick Ukie, Catherine Oyeyemi, Anthonia Bushari, Josephine Onwukwe, Michael Olasoji and Kehinde Adebisi.  Bishop Emmanuel Badejo of the Catholic Diocese of Oyo delivered the homily, titled: Blessed are those that mourn, for they shall be comforted. The cleric said only God knew the reason He allowed such a disaster to happen. He urged believers to move closer to God because death is inevitable and all will taste it one day. Also, Archbishop Gabriel Abegunrin of Ibadan Archdiocese advised Christians, especially Catholic members, not to lose hope and their faith at the cost of any evil event.
