Kogi State Governor Yahaya Bello has suspended the Vice Chancellor of the state university Prof. Mohammed Abdulkadir, and Rector of the state polytechnic Dr Muhammed Atureta. Commissioner for Information Kingsley Fanwo, who confirmed this yesterday, said Prof. Abdulkadir and Dr Atureta were suspended for insubordination. He told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that their suspension followed their non-compliance with the Treasury Single Account (TSA) policy. Fanwo said the Chief Medical Director of State Specialist Hospital, Dr Ahmed Attah, was suspended on February 7 for similar infraction. “The governor was irked by their failure to comply with the new financial directive,” he said. Fanwo explained that the governor had, at a meeting with heads of MDAs, warned that any disobedience to the directive would not be tolerated. He dismissed insinuations that the governor’s action was political, saying it was purely administrative. The media aide called on the management of agencies under the ministry to comply with the new financial guidelines, warning that anyone found wanting would not be shielded.
