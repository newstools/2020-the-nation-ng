Kwara State High Court sitting in Ilorin, the state capital, has ordered the forfeiture of a building of ex-executive director of Harmony Holdings Limited, an agency of the state government. Ilorin zonal office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) had approached the court asking it to confiscate the landed property, arguing that it was acquired through alleged fraudulent means. In an affidavit deposed to by an Investigative Officer with the EFCC, Denis Nnachi said “investigations revealed that the Ex-Kwara executive director (respondent) used fraudulently sold five plots of land belonging to the Kwara State Government in Galadimawa area of Abuja and used it to construct the building in question.” “The respondent used his position as executive director of Harmony Holdings Limited to influence the award of contracts to several companies where he had interest. “It was also discovered that the property known as 11, Catchment Road, GRA, Ilorin was constructed and developed using proceeds of unlawful activity.” At Wednesday sitting, EFCC counsel Sesan Ola moved a motion praying the court to forfeit the said property to the Federal Government.
