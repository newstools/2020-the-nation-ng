The Mexican government has confirmed the first two cases of the novel coronavirus, making it the second country in Latin America where cases have been reported. A 35-year-old man in Mexico City and a 41-year-old man in the state of Sinaloa tested positive for the potentially deadly virus after having travelled to Italy, health official Hugo Lopez-Gatell said on Friday. The men are showing only slight symptoms and have been placed in isolation, he said. Latin America’s first case of the coronavirus, which originated in December in China’s Wuhan region and has since spread to dozens of countries, was confirmed in Brazil on Wednesday. There are suspected cases in at least 10 other countries in the region. (dpa/NAN)
