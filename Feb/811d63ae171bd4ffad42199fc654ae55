The Hope Uzodinma administration has zero-tolerance for criminality, the Imo State government said on Wednesday. It denied allegations that the administration compries corrupt elements. Chief Press Secretary/Media Adviser to the governor, Oguwike Nwachuku, said the government was proud of its God-fearing workers who he said are committed to service. In a statement in Owerri, the state capital, Nwachuku said: “The rumour, therefore, making the sounds on alleged looting in Imo State Government House is nothing but a lie from the pit of hell. “The rumour is engineered by members of the previous administration and their agents, who are experts in asset-stripping. “They are yet to come to terms with the fact that the era of looting of government property is gone forever with their ouster from the government. “Because criminals will always be criminals, they are seeing in the planned review of the case the sacked Emeka Ihedioha’s administration took before the Supreme Court and the adjournment as another window of opportunity to cause disaffection. “Unfortunately, they did not know that they were only reminding Imo people of what they are noted for, that is, looting of public funds and asset-stripping of government property.” The statement stressed that under Uzodinma, Imo residents are happy that “the looters” were gone. “Governor Uzodinma does not only have confidence in the staff he has assembled to work with him, but he also has implicit confidence in the entire Imo State workforce and together they are working to ensure that Imo people are made prosperous. “Those who are alleging looting of government property should, therefore, have their heads examined or better still have a rethink in their interest,” it added.
