Armed robbers on Thursday raided two banks in Ondo State, killing two policemen and two other persons. The two banks are located in Ile-Oluji, headquarters of Ile-Oluji-Okeigbo Local Government Area of the state. The identities of those killed by the robbers could not be confirmed at press time, though two policemen were said to be among the dead. An eyewitness said the robbers gained entry into the banks after blowing up the security doors with dynamites. The incident took place around 4pm, it was gathered. Police spokesman, Femi Joseph, a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP), said a team of police officers were immediately drafted to the attacked banks. Sources said local hunters were on the trail of the robbers. Joseph confirmed the incident. “Our men as we speak have moved in to curtail the attackers,” he said. “The hoodlums used dynamites to destroy the doors of the two banks. “However, preliminary investigation revealed that they did not succeed in taking away anything from one of the banks, but we are still discussing with the officials of the other banks to know if anything was taken away by the robbers.
