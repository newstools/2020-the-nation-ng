 The governorship candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in the November 16 governorship election in Bayelsa state, Senator Douye Diri has called for unity in the state’s chapter of the party. Reacting to Thursday’s Supreme Court judgement that sacked his counterpart in the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr David Lyon, Diri called on members of the PDP defected to the APC in the state to rejoin the party. Speaking in Abuja hours after the judgment, Diri said, “I am waving the olive branch to all my people in the PDP who, out of one thing or the other, got angry and left us to APC. “I am waving the olive branch, please come back. We have to build Bayelsa State together. Our people in the APC, they are Bayelsans, we cannot continue to be in disunity. “Being in APC does not remove you as my brother of Bayelsa State. Whether you are Nembe, Sagbama or Southern Ijaw, that is the region that God has brought us together”.
