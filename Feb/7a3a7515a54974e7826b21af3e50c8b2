South Korea original equipment manufacturer (OEM), Samsung has said with the emergence of the new decade, the way people communicate and their world experience has evoloved. The Chief Marketing Officer Samsung Central Africa, Dudu Mokholo, who spoke during the unveiling of  Samsung Galaxy S20 in Lagos, said: “As we enter this new decade, how we communicate and how we experience the world around us has evolved. Samsung is, therefore, providing a next-generation device for transforming people’s lives. With an incredible AI powered camera, you can capture the moments as they happen and connect more seamlessly with the people you love.” He said the Samsung Galaxy S20, a new series of flagship devices that fundamentally changes the way people capture and experience the world, adding that it introduces a brand-new camera architecture that combines artificial intelligence (AI) with Samsung’s largest image sensor yet for stunning image quality. “Along with the camera, the Galaxy S20 makes the experience of everything we love to do with our phones, easier and better-enjoy personalised music for every moment of the day, watch videos the way they are meant to be seen and play console-style games on-the-go. “Now, more than ever, we capture our lives and tell our stories through our smartphones-and that is why the camera is the single-most important feature for consumers purchasing a new smartphone. Designed for the way we live, the Galaxy S20 introduces an entirely new camera system-powered by AI and with our biggest image sensor yet-to bring out the best in every image and every moment,” Mokholo said. The device camera offers super-high resolution (108MP for the Galaxy S20 Ultra; 64MP for the Galaxy S20 and S20+) to bring out the details with stunning clarity. The Galaxy S20 Ultra takes things a step further by combining nine pixels into one at the sensor level for higher quality images in low light, using cutting-edge binning technology.
