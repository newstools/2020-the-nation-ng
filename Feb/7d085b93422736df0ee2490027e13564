  A MAGISTRATE Court sitting in Osogbo, Osun State capital, on Thursday remanded eight members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ilesa Correctional Centre for alleged attempt to kill two chieftains of the party. Olaniyan Jelili, 53, Awotunde Nureni, 35, Nurudeen Taoheed, 30, Tiamiyu Olamide, 38, Zacchaeus Awosogbon, 41, Onikola Adekunle, 46, Rasaki Lawal, 44, and Adebisi Aditu, 45, were alleged to have attempted to kill the Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the PDP Diran Odeyemi and another chieftain of the party in the state, Akin Adeyi. They pleaded not guilty. Defence counsels Sina Adeniran and Nurudeen Kareem urged the court to grant their clients bail, saying they were still presumed to be innocent of the offence. But the prosecutor, Elisha Olusegun countered that they may jump bail because some of them do not reside within the court jurisdiction. Magistrate Olusegun Ayilara ordered that the accused persons be remanded in a correctional centre at Ilesa. He adjourned the case till March 6.
