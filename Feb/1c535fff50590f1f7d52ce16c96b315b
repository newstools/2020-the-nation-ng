 THE killing of a woman by an intoxicated night clubber suspected to be a naval officer in Yenagoa, the Bayelsa State capital, has triggered protests by various groups. The nightclub patron was said to have had an altercation with some individuals as he came out of Club 64. He pulled out a pistol and shot three times, the first two into the air, while the third hit a roadside food vendor near the club located at Baybridge in the state capital. The woman identified as Chioma Okwuadigbo died before sympathisers could rush her to hospital. She was aged 35 years. The drunken clubber disappeared into thin air, it was learnt. A source, who spoke in confidence, said: “The shooter came out of the club drunk. He had misunderstanding with some persons. He pulled out his pistol and shot into the air twice. The third time, the bullet strayed and hit the woman selling food in the area. She died before she could be taken to the hospital by sympathisers. The shooter ran away from the area”. The shooter was said to a regular customer at the club. The Nigeria Association of Women Journalists (NAWOJ) condemned the incident. The association in a statement signed by its chairperson, Maria Olodi-Osumah and Secretary, Grace Koinyan, said it was disheartening that the police were not treating the incident with seriousness. The statement said: “It’s disheartening that  Chioma Okwuadigbo at 35 years was snuffed out of her by security operatives who ought to protect her as a Nigerian. “Despite the fact that the incident had been reported to the police, no arrests have been made. “We are calling on the police to as a matter of urgency swing into action an arrest the officer involved, and ensure that the culprit is brought to book… The Igbo community in the state has also expressed distress about the killing. Also, the Ijaw Youths Council (IYC), Central Zone, appealed  to security agents to thoroughly investigate the matter to fish out the culprits.
