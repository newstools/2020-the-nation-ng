 The United Progressive Party (UPP), which is one the 74 recently de-registered parties by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), has announced the collapsing of all its structures from the ward to the national level into the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). The resolution was contained in a statement by the National Chairman of the defunct party, Chief Chekwas Okorie, after a meeting of the National Executive Committee (NEC), including the Board of Trustees (BOT) and other stakeholders of the UPP. The meeting, according to the statement, has directed all members of the UPP at all levels to proceed to register as members of the APC at their various wards of origin or the wards where they reside. Okorie said before the party resolved to pitch its tent with the APC after consultations with the leaders and stakeholders of the party. He said UPP members have been assured of a warm welcome and equal opportunities available to all bona fide members of the ruling party.  Tracing the relationship of the defunct UPP with the ruling party, Okorie said during the build-up to the last presidential election, the NEC of the UPP opted to support President Muhammadu Buhari in his bid for second term in the 2019 presidential election unconditionally. Okorie said: “We reviewed a number of options available to us, including the hand of fellowship extended to our party by some of the political parties that survived the INEC onslaught. “In view of our present circumstances, our party resolved unanimously that the most logical follow up to our earlier chosen political trajectory would be to collapse all our structures from the ward to the national level into the APC. “We have therefore directed our members at all levels to proceed to register as members of the APC at their various wards of origin or the wards where they are resident.”
