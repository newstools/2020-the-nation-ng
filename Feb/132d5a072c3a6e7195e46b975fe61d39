 NIGERIAN striker Odion Ighalo might be offered a permanent  deal  by Manchester United in the summer should his six-month loan deal  to the Old Trafford giants proved to be a ‘goal-rious’ time. The 30-year-old was snapped from Chinese side Shanghai Shenhua on transfer deadline day last month but manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has hinted about the possibility of extending the deal should the 2019 AFCON top scorer fires for the Red Devils on all cylinders. Solskjaer was upbeat speaking before last night EPL match against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge: “It’s a loan, but when you’re in the door and if you impress it gives you a chance. “That’s exactly the same for everyone who signs if it’s permanent or it’s a loan. “If you impress as a player, if you impress as a person, if you can help this group improve, then of course there’s a chance that we’ll look at extending things.” Speaking further, Solskjaer was confident about the scoring pedigree of Ighalo, adding the former Watford striker would prove critics wrong following his shock transfer to Old Trafford. He noted: “That doesn’t just go for Odion, but since you asked, yes, of course his incentive is to play as well as he can. And it’s up to us to make sure that he’d want to stay if we wanted him. “I think he’s probably pinching himself at times, because he’s now at his favourite club at the age of 30.Hopefully he’ll prove to you what I think he will. He’s a proven goals corer, so he’ll do all right.” Incidentally, Ighalo has equally pledged to work his socks after making his dream transfer to his boyhood club and would certainly be delighted with the manager’s prospection. ”My ambition is to work hard with the team and make sure we finish well in the season,” Ighalo said in his first major interview. “My aim is to contribute my own quota to the team and make sure we finish in good position.”
