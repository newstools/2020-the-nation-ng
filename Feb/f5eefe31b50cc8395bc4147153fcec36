Agency Reporter  Arsenal and Tottenham usually battle it out on the pitch but now they are competing off the field to host Anthony Joshua’s next fight. Promoter Eddie Hearn has revealed he has offers on the table from both sides to host Joshua’s summer fight with Kubrat Pulev at the Emirates Stadium or Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Joshua will look to retain his WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight belts when he takes on Bulgaria’s Pulev with the bout set to go ahead in June. Reports suggest staff at the Emirates have been told they will have to work at a major event in the summer but it seems Tottenham are winning the race to host Joshua’s upcoming showdown. Hearn told the Mirror: “Terms are, I’d not say agreed, but we’re in a good position. “We have an agreement in principle for a June fight.  “Spurs is our preference and now Arsenal have come in. “When you go to other countries, like in the Middle East, you have Saudi Arabia, they hear Abu Dhabi or Qatar are looking at a fight. “Well now it’s like Spurs and Arsenal. It’s not been done before at Arsenal, but I don’t see why not. “If you want to establish yourself as a sports entertainment destination, it’s a pretty big coup to get this fight. “It’s the north London race for this fight. Tottenham is our preference, but we’re talking to Arsenal and they’ve come in and said, “How do we make this happen?”  Tottenham’s £1billion state-of-the-art stadium opened in April 2019. The club have a 10-year partnership to  host regular-season NFL games but are also keen on expanding their current agreements.
