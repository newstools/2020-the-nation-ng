NIGERIA’S hope of qualifying for the badminton event of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics is currently hanging in the balance as the Egyptian Embassy is yet to grant the country’s contingent visa to the All Africa Senior Championships in Egypt in Cairo which begins today. As yesterday’s evening, the team made up of 12 players (six male and six female players) were yet to be granted visa by the Egyptian Embassy in Abuja to the chagrin of the President of the Badminton Federation of Nigeria (BFN) Barrister Francis Orbih. Orbih stated that the BFN considers the treatment as alarming and shocking noting that it is capable of derailing Nigeria’s plan of qualifying for the Olympics. He said: “The BFN submitted the Team’s application for visa on the 28th of January 2020 with all the supporting and necessary documents, yet the embassy has refused to respond which has fuelled suspicion of deliberate sabotage and foul play by the embassy. This negates all tenets of Fair Play and Sportsmanship.”
