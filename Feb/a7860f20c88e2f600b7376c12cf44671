 JURGEN KLOPP expects Liverpool’s Champions League defeat to Atletico Madrid to spark a reaction when they face West Ham in the Premier League on Monday night. Tuesday’s 1-0 loss at the Estadio Metropolitano was only Liverpool’s third defeat of a remarkable season, including the Carabao Cup exit to Aston Villa in which the Under-23s played. Although they will need to wait until the reverse leg at Anfield on March 11 to exact revenge against Atletico, they can take their frustrations out on David Moyes’ relegation-battling Hammers. “We lost the game, there’s absolutely no positive in it, but if there’s any help in that result it’s that you felt a defeat,” he said. “Nobody thought: ‘Oh, in the league we’re fine’. “We have to put it right to get the other feeling back. I don’t think we ever lost how a win feels, but now we lost the difference is massive. It’s much more than three points. It’s really from sunshine to hardest rain.  “That’s how it should be if you want to be successful, how we could have been in that game. Then it has to feel really bad and that’s how it felt. So yes, we want to put it right even though it will be a different competition.” Liverpool will be without club captain Jordan Henderson for Monday’s game, with Klopp revealing he expects the midfielder to be sidelined for around three weeks after suffering a hamstring injury 10 minutes from time in Madrid. “It could have been worse,” Klopp said. “We all know it was a hamstring thing and we have heard of different hamstring injuries in the Premier League – Harry Kane and stuff like that. “It’s not that bad but he will be out for three weeks or so which is not cool, but how we see it we were still lucky.”
