Members of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Imo State House of Assembly, who defected to All Progressives Congress (APC), have been told not to expect financial settlement for their actions. President-General of Onitsha South Shop Owners Traders Association (OSSOTAN) Eric Uwaoma addressed a news conference in Onitsha, Anambra State, at the weekend. Uwaoma called on Governor Hope Uzodinma to redeem the battered image of his party with good governance. Uwaoma, who coordinates Camp Hope Campaign Organisation in Egwuedo Atta Njaba, urged the governor to be wary of sycophants and ensure no part of the state was neglected. He said: “While disagreeing with the people who are criticising PDP members who defected to APC, I believe they have seen the handwriting on the wall and have shown patriotism to the state. However, we expect that what the defectors have in mind is to work for the people and not expect any financial settlement from Uzodinma for their action. “The people are not expecting them to have personal financial interest in their minds for their action; if you have defected, we believe it is for the interest of your constituency and the state, and not for personal financial settlement or enrichment; you must show that you have the interest of the state in your minds.” Uwaoma pleaded with the people and opponents to sheath their sword and join the governor to take the state to the next level, saying ‘God knows why he brought him to be the governor’.
