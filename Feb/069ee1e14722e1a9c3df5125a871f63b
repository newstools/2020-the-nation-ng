Nigeria’s preparations to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics got yet another boost yesterday with the Edo state Deputy Governor  Philip Shuaibu adopted Nigerian athlete Nwokocha Nzubechi with the payment of $10,000 . The  Adopt-a-Talent initiative is a brain child  of  Youth and Sports Development  Minister Sunday Dare and the Deputy Governor largesse was paid directly into the account of the adopted athlete. Nzubechi  has since confirmed  the payment of the said amount  to former Olympic medalist and Special Adviser to the Minister Mary Onyali. Shuaibu, a keen football aficionado, inspired Bendel Insurance of Benin to secure promotion to the elite league and he is still a registered player in the second tier league. Nzubechi, who was born on the April 7th 2001, hails from Abia state and is a student of the University of Port Harcourt. She competed in the 100m in 2019 and will be part of Team Nigeria to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. In a related development, Minister of youth and sports Development has certified Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium ready for the next edition of National Sports Festival that is bid to kickoff 20th March, 2020 in Benin City, Edo State. “I am impressed with what I have seen here at the Samuel Ogbemudia Sports Complex, it shows clearly that there has been consistent work going on here,  the Minister said  during his visit to the  Samuel Ogbemudia Sports Complex. “There has been commitment on the part of his Excellency and also the deputy governor to make sure that this place is finished in a record time. “I have seen progress and I can say this stadium is about 85% or 90% ready for the National Sports Festival,” he added.
