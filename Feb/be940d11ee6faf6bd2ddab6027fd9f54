Five years ago, Iya Oge of Lagos, Chief Mrs. Opral Benson, held a massive birthday party to mark 80. This year, she decided to go low-key for her 85th celebration. For her landmark on Tuesday, she held an exclusive dinner in Lagos. It was learnt that she didnâ€™t intend to do anything elaborate but her staff and close friends persuaded her. Married to former Information Minister, Chief Theophilus Benson, fondly called TOS Benson, the socialite was the cynosure of all eyes on Lagos social scene for many years. But in recent times, she has slowed down. Some have argued that age could be the major factor responsible for this.
