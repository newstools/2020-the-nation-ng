President Muhammadu Buhari has described the life and time of the late Col. Paul Ogbebor (retd.) as one well spent and marked with indelible prints. Buhari recalled that Ogbebor was the first cadet to be enrolled at the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA), following which he dedicated his life to a memorable military service. Buhari, according to a statement issued by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr Femi Adesina, also recalled that the late Ogbebor emerged a hero of the Nigerian Civil War. “It’s the end of a life well spent, with footprints indelibly printed in the sands of time,” said the statement. “President Buhari salutes the community spirit of the departed, who was in the vanguard of the socio-cultural group, Edo Leaders of Thought, and chieftain of the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF). “The late Col Ogbebor had documented his professional life through a book, Nigerian Defence Academy: A Pioneer Cadet’s Memoir, which the president says is one of the vital resource materials on the pioneer military training institution in the country. “He commiserates with the family, friends and professional colleagues of the departed, urging them to take solace in the fact that Col Ogbebor lived a distinguished life, signposted by many achievements,” the statement said.
