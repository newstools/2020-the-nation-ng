 IT was a special night for Odion Ighalo on Thursday as he got his first goal for Manchester United during a comprehensive 5-0 thumbing of Club Brugge in the second leg of Europa League round of 32 fixture at Old Trafford. The 30-year-old was making his first start for the Red devils since he made a loan switch on transfer deadline day from Chinese side, Shanghai Shenhua. The self-proclaimed Manchester United fan was also making his debut in front of home fans in the second tier European competition. Ighalo played as a substitute in the first leg which finished 1-1 in Belgium but the hamstring injury picked up by Anthony Martial in training this week allowed manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to select the Nigerian to lead the forward line. â€œ
