 Following the ban on Okada in Lagos State, the Oyo State Government has pledged to control the influx of commercial motorcycles into the state. This was revealed in a statement yesterday made available by the Executive Chairman, Oyo State Road Transport Management Authority (OYRTMA), Dr. Akin Fagbemi, in Ibadan. He said: “We are aware of the massive exodus of affected motorcycle operators to Oyo State, which is anticipated, but I assure you that OYRTMA is on top of its game. “As we earnestly await the position of the government under the leadership of Governor Seyi Makinde on the proscription or otherwise of motorcycles within the major highways in the state, it is crucial we get ourselves prepared for what is to come.” Fagbemi said although the state is reputed for its hospitality, it would, however, take proactive steps to stop any breach in security or overstretching of the available infrastructure. He said OYRTMA had put in place measures to have a central database of cabs, tricycles and motorcycles so that the identities of operators and their vehicles would be known to the government. The executive chairman said measures are at advanced stage to start the routing of cabs, tricycles and motorcycles across the state. This, he said, would enable easy identification in cases of stolen vehicles/machines, road crashes and operational axis. Fagbemi said with the support of sister security agencies, OYRTMA will continue with its ‘Special Operation-one-Passenger’ (SOOP), which directs motorcyclists to carry only one passenger as against the common practice of two or more passengers. The statement said under the operation, which started last month, 200 people will be arraigned at the Mobile Magistrate Court and sanctioned if found guilty.
