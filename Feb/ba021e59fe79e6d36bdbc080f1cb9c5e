The Edo State Government has urged orphanage homes across the state to uphold the fundamental rights of children in their care and abide by guidelines set by the state government for orphanages. Commissioner of Social Development and Gender Issues, Hon. Mrs. Maria Edeko disclosed this at a one-day sensitisation workshop for proprietors of orphanage homes in Benin City. The workshop was organised by the Ministry of Social Development and Gender Issues at the Festival Hall, Government House, Benin City. She said, “This is part of the vision, mission and mandate of the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led administration to protect and promote the rights of every citizen in Edo State. The state government, through the Ministry, will not relent in protecting and promoting the rights of all vulnerable persons in the society, which include orphans, destitute and other children with challenges. Edeko said the workshop is part of the ministry’s engagement plans to protect women and children, adding “If we must run an orphanage home, we need to teach the owners on what to do because it is quite an important aspect. A child is entitled to all the rights. “The child rights laws spell out our stance that no child is for sale. Child trafficking will not be tolerated in Edo State. Anyone found wanting no matter how highly placed will be dealt with according to international and state laws,” she warned. The commissioner noted that proprietors of orphanages must uphold right practices, adding that every orphanage is supposed to provide an atmosphere where a child takes his/her prep after school, has access to sports facilities, good healthcare services and free education. The Edo State Chairman, Association of Proprietors of Orphanages and Children’s Home (APOCH), Rev Father Johnbosco Ezehi said the state government has taken the right step by organising the workshop to engage with stakeholders in the sector.
