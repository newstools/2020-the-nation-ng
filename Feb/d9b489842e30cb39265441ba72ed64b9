The Ekiti State Teaching Service Commission has dismissed three randy secondary school teachers over allegedly taking canal knowledge of their female pupils. The Chairman, Mr Babatunde Abegunde who made this known in Ado Ekiti, said the decision was reached at the board’s emergency plenary held in Ado-Ekiti on Friday. The police had on Wednesday arrested by the teachers following a petition filed by an activist alleging sexual molestation of secondary school pupils. He said the dismissal was consequent on the report of the Commission’s Disciplinary Committee after thorough investigation. Abegunde said the board dismissed the erring teachers for sexual violence, saying the act amounted to gross misconduct unbecoming of those entrusted with the responsibility of moulding the destiny of the younger ones. He explained that the dismissal was in line with the Public Service Rules and the State Teachers’ Manual, stressing the Commission followed due process as laid down by extant rules to avoid a miscarriage of justice in arriving at its decision. The Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr. Wale Fapohunda, had last week raised the alarm over incessant cases of alleged rape in many of the secondary schools across the state. Fapohunda said that all the cases already reported to the government and security agencies will be investigated and the culprits prosecuted, to serve as deterrent to others.
