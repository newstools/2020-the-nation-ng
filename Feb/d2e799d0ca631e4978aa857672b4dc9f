CRYSTAL PALACE manager Roy Hodgson is predicting a low-scoring affair when Newcastle visits Selhurst Park today. The two clubs have struggled in front of goal this season, with the Eagles finding the net only 23 times in 26 Premier League matches. Steve Bruce’s Newcastle have only fared slightly better, scoring one more than Palace in the top flight this term, but the pair hold a healthy advantage over the bottom three due to their defensive prowess. “Most games seem to be 1-0 or 2-0 and I don’t see any particular event on the horizon to suggest this won’t be that type of game,” Hodgson told reporters at a press conference. “Both teams know how to defend and are fully aware that once you concede a goal it’s very hard to score at the other end.” Palace have scored the fewest amount in the division and yet are 14th, with a six-point cushion over West Ham – who are 18th – and just four points off Arsenal in 10th. Forward Cenk Tosun will be back and, for the first time in a long while, Hodgson will have genuine competition in attack with Wilfried Zaha, Jordan Ayew, Christian Benteke, Andros Townsend, Max Meyer and the on-loan Everton striker all vying for a starting berth. “We have the firepower to score more goals than we have so far,” Hodgson added. “We started so well and have had the brakes put on particularly by injury and partly by misfortune. “At one stage when we were flying high we were hoping to finish in the top half and, at the moment, I don’t see any reason why we should abandon that hope.”
