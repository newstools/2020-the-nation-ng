 In my last article, I mentioned some things that may make it difficult for insurance companies to accept liability. It should however, be noted that it is not a way of escape, as many would have thought, but practical facts that need to be understood and avoided. This will take us to today’s topic on how to get your claims settled promptly. Getting your claims settled is different from getting it promptly. My focus is on how you can get your claims faster so that you can move on with life and business.  For a business owner, the longer it takes to be reinstated the greater the loss. Why then will you allow your carelessness to cost you so much, when this can be avoided? It is important to state that the speed at which a claim is settled, whether promptly or otherwise, solely depends on how fast the substantiating documents are submitted. Imagine this scenario: a policyholder who reported a claim some years back was asked to submit the substantiating documents. He was submitting in bits. How would his claim be attended to promptly with this kind of attitude? Another major cause of delay is when there is disagreement in respect of the quantum offered by the insurer. ie. the policyholder is not accepting the amount of settlement. This may go on for a very long time and may also end up in litigation if care is not taken. Some insurance companies experience this with their customers and it can be another reason for not settling claims on time. Therefore, I want to advice insurance consumers to take note of the following which will assist in getting their clams settled on time. However, if you follow the above advice and you still feel your claim is unnecessarily delayed or you are not satisfied with the services received, you are free to change your insurance company at renewal.
