 Students Union of  the Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba-Akoko (AAUA), has reiterated its commitment to relieving students’ hardship as regards their tuition fee. Speaking with CAMPUSLIFE, the immediate past president AAUA-SU, Adesomoju Samuel, said the union would liaise with the institution’s alumni body and other interested parties to set up a committee that would look into the financial predicaments of their colleagues who are finding it difficult to pay their tuition fees. He said: “The committee will be empowered by the constitution of the Student Union to go across all faculties and get names of genuine, sincere students who don’t have the means of payment, either half or full,” Adesomoju began. “They must be students who owe arrears of up to two semesters or more. Some are in 400-Level but even as we speak, they are yet to pay for 200-Level. Such student’s fee will be covered for a session, leaving such student to pay for 300-Level alone.”  Furthermore, Adesomoju who would be handing over the baton to the new executive, recalled how the initiative mooted by his administration, would now be actuallised by his successor. Adesomoju noted that the said financial aid would not be determined by student’s academic feat. He thanked kind-hearted Nigerians who according to him, have been donating to the cause. “We’re not using academic criteria. So if you have a genuine, sincere reason to show that you’re unable to pay the tuition fee, you’re eligible. We have about 1000 students who’re in this situation and we’ll try to give them consideration as much as we can. “It is a move by the Students’ Union body. The money might not come during my era. Definitely, it is coming for the next administration and people are already donating to the Students’ Union to achieve this target. So, I will implore the incoming administration to be wise and patient as this scheme cannot cover everybody,” Adesomoju concluded.
