Emma Elekwa, Onitsha  Former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Prof Kingsley Moghalu has said the technology in Nnewi, Anambra state had the capacity of transforming the Nigerian economy more than the oil. He however regretted the neglect the industrial area had suffered from the federal government, accusing of chasing foreign investments at the expense of great investment potentials internally. Delivering a paper weekend at the Nnewi Investment Summit in Nnewi, Moghalu argued that the people in the area would have attained greater heights if they were adequately motivated. Moghalu who was the presidential candidate of the Young Peoples Party in the 2019 general elections, advocated for the creation of a manufacturing hub in the industrial city instead of pumping in Naira to compete the dollar. He said, “Nnewi is the only industrial town in the world that is growing without the support of government. “A huge manufacturing hub that was started from the scratch by indigenes of the town and has continued to grow without the support of the government. “It will not be out of place to say that the federal government has neglected Nnewi. Do you know what people in Nnewi will do if what government did elsewhere is done here?  “The manufacturing sector is the easiest way to grow the economy of a country; it doesn’t matter the number of mineral resources you have. How many mineral resources does China have? “A nation can survive without minerals by manufacturing and exporting her products, and that is what made China tick. “That is why I always say that the chase for foreign Investment is a wild goose chase. If you create the right environment, investments will come. Money knows where to go and multiply, you do not need to go asking it to come. “Instead of pumping in Naira to rival the dollar, why not create a manufacturing hub and once products are exported and foreign exchange is earned, you will see the economy grow on its own.”
