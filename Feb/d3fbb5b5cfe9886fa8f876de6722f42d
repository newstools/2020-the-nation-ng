 All Progressives Congress (APC) Wednesday kept mum over the reaffirmation of Senator Duoye Diri as the elected governor of Bayelsa State by the Supreme Court. The national chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole who had earlier called for a press conference in his office at the partyâ€™s national Secretariat later called it off. No reason was given for the call off. All Progressives Congress had earlier applied for a review of the February 13 judgement of the Supreme Court that disqualified its governorship candidate, Mr. David Lyon.
