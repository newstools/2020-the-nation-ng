  The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has asked the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr Adams Oshiomhole, to steer clear of Bayelsa state. The party accused Oshiomhole of plotting to trigger violence in Bayelsa over Thursday’s judgment of the Supreme Court that sacked the APC governor-elect, Mr David Lyon. The judgment may pave the way for the emergence of the candidate of the PDP, Senator Douye Diri to be sworn-in as governor today. Reacting to the judgment, Oshiomhole had said that the PDP candidate cannot be sworn-in as governor, saying that the PDP did not win the constitutionally stipulated number of votes to enable him take the governorship seat. But in a swift reaction, the PDP described Oshiomhole’s statement as empty and inconsequential ranting, adding that his alleged plot to trigger violence in the state had failed. The PDP cautioned the APC chairman to be careful with his utterances and not use any forms of venomous garrulity and clear misuse of language to destabilise the nation and truncate democracy. The statement said, “The people of Bayelsa state know as a fact that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) under our laws cannot take instructions from any individual, let alone a factional national chairman of a dysfunctional political party like the APC. “The PDP, as a law-abiding party, counsels Oshiomhole to rein in himself and desist from all odious designs against Bayelsa state, her people and government”. The party also called on the people of Bayelsa state to remain calm, as their mandate has been restored and cannot be taken away by the ranting of any individual who has no stake whatsoever in the wellbeing of his own home state.
