 JUSTICE Bab Kuewumi of a Federal High Court, Lagos, has returned to the court’s Chief Judge the case file on alleged $15,591,700 fraud charge against Dr. Waripamo-owei Dudafa and six other defendants. Dudafa is a former Senior Special Adviser (SSA) to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan. The judge, on Friday, informed the parties that he took the decision following his transfer out of the court’s Lagos Division. He said his decision remained, pending the response to a letter by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) seeking the CJ’s “fiat” to allow him continue hearing the matter. EFCC counsel, Mr U. U Buhari, had informed Justice Kuewumi of the letter, which he believed was written by his lead counsel, Mr Rotimi Oyedepo. He said the prosecution was awaiting the Chief Judge’s response. Responding, Justice Kuewumi said: “The case file is hereby remitted to the registry pending fiat.” Dudafa is on trial alongside a lawyer, Amajuoyi Azubuike Briggs, and a senior staff member of Skye Bank Plc, Adedamola Bolodeoku. The other defendants are four firms: Pluto Property Development Company Limited; Seagate Property Development Company Limited, Transocean Property Development Company Limited, and Avalon Property Development Company Limited. The EFCC alleged that the firms were used as conduit pipes by the former First lady, Mrs. Patience Jonathan. The defendants were arraigned before the judge on September 15, 2016. The companies, through their supposed directors – Agbo Michael Baro, Friday Davis, Kola Frederick, Taiwo Ebenezer and Chima John – pleaded guilty to the charges. But on September 27, 2016, they sought to change their plea and the EFCC opposed them. Justice Kuewumi, on October 7, 2016, dismissed the defendants’ applications to plead not guilty. It convicted the companies of the allegations of conspiracy, money laundering, stealing and fraud, on November 2, 2016. The EFCC alleged in a second amended charge that the three accused persons alongside the four companies, between November 13, 2013 and March 31, 2015, conspired with Sombre Omeibi, who is said to be on the run, to retain $15,591,700. It said the “reasonably ought to have known” that the sums formed part of the proceeds of an unlawful act. They were also alleged to have wired the money through account numbers: 2110002207; 2110002245; 2110002238; 0122493290; 2110002252; domiciled in Skye Bank Plc. The anti-graft agency also alleged that the accused persons forged Skye Bank’s mandate card, which was purportedly signed by the purported directors of the companies, namely: Friday Davis, kola Fredrick, Agbo Baro, Taiwo Ebenezer and Chima John.
