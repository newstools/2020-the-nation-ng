 WILFRED NDIDI was not rushed back from surgery, Brendan Rodgers has insisted, amid the Nigerian’s continued knee problems. Last month, Ndidi returned to action 13 days after a knee operation in what Rodgers described as an “incredible recovery”. However, after just two appearances, against West Ham and Aston Villa, the pain returned to Ndidi’s knee and he has now been ruled out of a third straight match with Rodgers confirming his unavailability for this weekend’s clash with Manchester City. Rodgers is not putting a timeline on the 23-year-old’s return either to ensure there is no recurrence of the problem, but he is adamant that the soreness was not caused by a rushed return. “Medically, he passed the tests and measures to show he was okay,” said Rodgers. “He had played a game and a half. He came on here after half an hour against West Ham and came through that. Then he played in the other game [in the Carabao Cup second leg against Villa]. “From a manager’s perspective, you are guided by medics and himself. He just didn’t quite get the right feeling going into the Chelsea game.” Ndidi was initially in the line-up to play against Chelsea three weeks ago, but was pulled out at the last minute after Rodgers noticed he wasn’t moving freely.
