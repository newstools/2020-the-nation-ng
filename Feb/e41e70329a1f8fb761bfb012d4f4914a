 TWO suspected kidnappers were on Tuesday apprehended in Erusu-Akoko, Akoko North-West Local Government Area of Ondo State after failing to snatch a two-year-old baby from her mother’s back. Sources said the mother of the baby raised the alarm after she was trailed by the suspected kidnappers from Aga area of the town. It was learnt that the woman struggled with the hoodlums who attempted to pull her child from her back.
An eyewitness said the loud shouts of the baby’s mother attracted sympathisers who rushed to the scene of the incident to rescue the victims, and eventually prevented the kidnappers from evading arrest. It was learnt that the irate mob pounced on the attackers, stripped them naked and attempted to set them ablaze, but for the prompt intervention of the traditional ruler of the town, Oba Sunday Mogaji, a lawyer. Police from the Oke Age Division were reportedly invited while the two suspects were handed over to them. After interrogation it was discovered that the two suspects are from Oyin Akoko but lived in Oke Agbe. The Area Commander of the Akoko Police Division, Assistant Commissioner of Police(ACP) Razak Rauf who confirmed the arrest of the suspects, stated that investigations have begun on the matter. According to him, the suspects have been transferred to the State Criminal Investigation Department of the state police command in Akure, the state capital.
