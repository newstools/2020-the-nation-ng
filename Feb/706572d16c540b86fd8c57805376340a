 THERE was pandemonium in Ubudom village in Atta community of Njaba Local Government Area of Imo State over the sudden disappearance of a Catholic catechist Camilus Obioha. Obioha, 78, works for St. Fidelis’ Catholic Church, Atta and is in charge of St. Monica’s Catholic Station, Ubudom Atta as catechist. He was declared missing by one of his children, Mr. Chinedu Shanco Obioha. He was said to have left his house Friday morning and could not return in the night. “We started getting worried when he didn’t return around 5pm that Friday because he doesn’t keep late night except any day there is something happening in the church. Even on market days, he usually returns home early. “So, it was surprising to us that he didn’t return home even without a word to anyone at home,” another member of the family told The Nation. Asked whether the disappearance of the catechist could have anything to do with abduction, the source said the likelihood of a kidnap was slim the man is only a peasant farmer. The people of the community remain worried.
