Allianz Nigeria Insurance plc, has launched a new initiative called “The 60-minute Revolution”. This ensures that customers experience faster claims resolution within 60 minutes. Its Executive Director, Owolabi Salami, who spoke with reporters yesterday, said it would no longer be business as usual as customers would have their motor claims settled within 60 minutes so long as they send the required documents. He said the company understand that complete customer satisfaction is not solely about giving competitive rates or swift delivery of policy documents but also how quickly they can have claims resolved and how quickly they can help customers get back on track. He added that customers no longer had to worry about how long a claim would take or when they would get paid, as it would only take 60 minutes to have their claims resolved. The Head of Retail Claims, Adedoyin Dickson, said what they required to enable them achieve this feat is a filled claim form, picture showing full view of vehicle and estimate of repair. On the rationale behind the initiative, its Chief Marketing and Strategy Officer for Allianz Nigeria, Walter Bossman said: “In a society as fast-paced as ours where every aspect of life seems to be competing for your attention, a delayed motor claim should not be on the list. Hence, our resolve to revolutionise the industry by making sure that our customers are not inconvenienced any further by paying their claims within 60 minutes.” The Allianz Group is one of the world’s leading insurers and asset managers with more than 92 million retail and corporate customers. Allianz customers benefit from a broad range of personal and corporate insurance services, ranging from property, life and health insurance to assistance services to credit insurance and global business insurance.
