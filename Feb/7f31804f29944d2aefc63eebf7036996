 THE Committee of the Indigenous Associations of Lagos State (CIALS) has supported the ban on commercial motorcycles (Okada) and tricycles (Keke Marwa). At a briefing at the weekend by CIALS, Prof. Rasheed Kola Ojikutu, who heads the association, said the government has demonstrated strong commitment and dedication to making the state primus inter parae. Ojikutu, a Professor of Statistics at the Faculty of Management Sciences, University of Lagos, said: “The proliferation of these Okada and Keke Marwa operators has increased statistics on mortality and morbidity as well as robbery. “A situation where over 10,000 accidents caused by motorcycles and tricycles were recorded at the General Hospitals alone, cannot and should not be condoned by any serious government. Many of the hospitals and mortuaries, particularly the government-owned, are filled with productive lives that have either been maimed or terminated. “Asking Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to pretend that this catastrophe did not occur is like teaching a child the path to ungodliness. We, in CIALS, refuse in this regard to succumb to this tyranny of a few vested interests.”
