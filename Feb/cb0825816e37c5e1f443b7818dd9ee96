The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) said on Friday it destroyed compounds housing Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) terrorists in Kaza, Ngala Local Government Area of  Borno State. The Director, Public Relations and Information of the Air Force,  Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, said the  strike was executed on Wednesday  following intelligence that some ISWAP members had  relocated to the area from  nearby Tongule. According to him, the intelligence  showed that some ISWAP elements had set up camps in a cluster of compounds in Kaza, along with their logistics supplies. “The identified location within the settlement was attacked by the ATF’s fighter jets after confirmatory Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions, showed significant presence of terrorists,”  he said. “This resulted in the destruction of the structures and the neutralisation of some of the ISWAP fighters.” Daramola vowed  that the NAF and surface forces would  sustain air campaign to shape the battle space in the North East for the effective conduct of further ground and air operations.
