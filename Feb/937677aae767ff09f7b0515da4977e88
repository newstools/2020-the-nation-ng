The Management of Zenith Bank on Monday showered praises on the national women basketball team, D’Tigress, for winning a ticket to the 2020 Olympics Games billed for Tokyo, Japan in July. The Nigerian team grabbed the precious ticket at the Olympics qualifiers which took place from February 6 and 9 in Serbia. After beating Mozambique by 85-51 points in their first match the results of other matches were only academics for the back-to-back African Champions. The Group managing Director of Zenith Bank, Ebenezer Onyeagwu, said the outfit was particularly elated because the women basketball team has displayed so much consistency in recent time. He said: “This team won the last two Women AfroBasket and they played in the quarterfinal of the World Cup and now won the Tokyo 2020 ticket. “We are so happy about this progress in the team which also shows that the girls are gradually joining the best teams in the world stage.” Musa Murjanatu of Air Warriors who was the MVP in the final of the 2019 Zenith Women’s Basketball League was part of the team that won the ticket in Serbia. Evelyn Akhator, who was also in the team was a product of Zenith basketball league. Chioma Udeaja, Nkechi Akhasiki, Upe Atosu and Nkem Akaraiwe are other prominent Zenith Bank League players who at some point also featured for the D’Tigress. “It is a thing of joy that our annual Zenith league is yielding dividends for the country. We are really happy and we expect D’Tigress to continue to make more progress in the basketball world,” Onyeagwu added.
