President Muhammadu Buhari is expected in Ondo State today for the inauguration of the Ore flyover and industrial park, as part of activities to mark the third anniversary of Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu administration. The Chairman of the Anniversary Planning Committee and Commissioner for Finance, Mr. Wale Akinterinwa, made this known on Monday at a news conference to highlight activities for the anniversary. He said President Buhari with the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and other personalities will inaugurate key projects across the senatorial districts.
