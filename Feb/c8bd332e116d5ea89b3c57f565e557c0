Antonio Rudiger is the first defender to score a twice for Chelsea in a Premier League game since John Terry against Fulham in April 2013 Leicester and Chelsea played out an entertaining Premier League draw in a see-saw encounter at King Power Stadium. The result means the Foxes stay third in the table, eight points above Chelsea in fourth. After a largely uneventful first half, the game came to life just after the break when Antonio Rudiger headed Chelsea in front from Mason Mount’s corner. Brendan Rodgers’ team levelled eight minutes later, Harvey Barnes’ effort deflecting off Blues defender Reece James into the top-right corner. And Rodgers looked to be heading towards a first win over Chelsea at the 14th attempt as a manager when Ben Chilwell swept a Youri Tielemans cross into the bottom left corner. But Rudiger’s second headed goal of the day – from another Mount delivery – ensured Frank Lampard’s side claimed a point. And although Lampard has recently talked of his side being “underdogs” in the race for Champions League qualification, it is difficult to see which teams below them are capable of bridging the gap. Lampard will have been delighted by the way his side took charge at the start of each half and then, when they fell behind to a transformed Leicester team, had the resolve to fight back to earn a merited point. The outcome in part also vindicated Lampard’s decision to drop the world’s most expensive goalkeeper, Kepa Arrizabalaga, in favour of Willy Caballero.
