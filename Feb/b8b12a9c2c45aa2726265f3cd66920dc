The Adamawa State Ministry of Health says it has already activated its emergency response system by communicating with relevant officials against possible case of coronavirus in the state. The Director of Public Health Emergencies in the ministry, Dr Bwalki Dilli, who spoke to our correspondent Friday on the reported case in Lagos, said the ministry swung into action on learning about the Lagos case earlier in the day. Dr Bwalki said: “We have already communicated with our clinicians to be on the alert and watch out for possible cases. We have updated them on what to look out for and how to detect cases. “We are reaching out immediately and sensitising members of the public to immediately contact the nearest health centres when they notice signs of whatever kind and the centres in question will take it up from there. “Good enough, each of the 226 wards across the 21 LGAs of the state has at least one public health centre, so our people have somewhere close to them to report to. “We have emergency centres we activated when we had outbreak of Lassa fever recently. They will help even in this case. “So, our people have no cause for alarm. The state Ministry of Health is alive to the situation. The public should only do their part by being prompt to report suspected cases.”
