Our Reporter  Roger Federer admitted “this is so much more than just tennis” after playing an exhibition match with Rafael Nadal in front of a record 51,954 in Cape Town. Federer was playing his first match in South Africa, his mother’s country of birth and where he spent many childhood vacations, along with world No 2 Rafael Nadal, co-founder of Microsoft, Bill Gates and comedian, Trevor Noah. The exhibition took place in order to raise money for the Roger Federer Foundation and its work supporting early childhood education in six southern African countries, including South Africa. Before the coin toss, South Africa’s World Cup-winning rugby captain Siya Kolisi presented the Swiss great with his very own Springbok jersey with ‘Federer 8’ on the back.  Federer defeated his rival Nadal 6-4 3-6 6-4 in one hour and 47 minutes, but the match will be remembered for the money raised in front of a record attendance. “It was such a privilege to be here tonight. Of course, we want to try and play the best tennis we can. That’s what we’re world famous for and it was an absolute pleasure to share the court with Rafa (Nadal) again, but the first time here in beautiful Cape Town in South Africa. It means so much more and it really is very, very special on so many levels,” said Federer.
