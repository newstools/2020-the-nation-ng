The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has tasked newly recruited youths in the Public Works Volunteer (PUWOV) scheme, to be selfless and value-driven in discharging their duties. Governor Obaseki who was represented by the Special Adviser and Chairman, Strategic Planning and Programme Management, Dr. Uyi Iduwa-Malaka, gave the charge while delivering a lecture on leadership at the ongoing training for youths into the batch B of the scheme, in Okada, Ovia North East Local Government Area. He urged the youths to embrace the Obaseki-led administration’s vision for the state and acquire leadership skills in line with the objectives of the scheme in offering selfless service to members of the public. The governor said in delivering on their tasks, the youths must be value-driven and strong-willed, noting, “Through our training, we are going to have a gradual orientation which drums the essence of leadership. We intend to organise such programmes for Edo youths to redirect their thinking, looking toward things with positive impact in the society. He noted, “One of the focus of this administration is to invest in our people through capacity building programmes, which have been set-up to enable us achieve that. “Wherever you find yourself, you should be able to tell your story in the correct way. You should not allow people to tell your story for you. We are Edo people, we have strong values; we have strong faith in what we believe in. We believe that Edo will be better, greater, and it starts from you.” One of the trainees, Mr. Omoregbe Agbondimwem, expressed appreciation to the governor for the opportunity to serve the state.
