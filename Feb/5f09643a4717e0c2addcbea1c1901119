Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide, says it is aggressively lobbying the two dominant political parties in the country- the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to field Igbo candidates from the South East and Igbo speaking parts of the South South, especially Ikwerre in Rivers State and Anioma in Delta State as candidates for the 2023 presidential election. This was contained in a statement signed by the President General, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro. According to him: “Talks are on with the APC and the PDP to zone the 2023   presidential tickets to  Southern Nigeria.  First of all, the  OYC had reached out  through appropriate channels to major political parties for them to respect the gentleman agreement on rotational presidency between the North and the South. If it’s achieved, then it will be  equitable for the only geo political zone which has never taken a shot at the presidency since 50 years after the Biafra war to  be encouraged to produce all the presidential candidates for 2023. “The  OYC diaspora through freewill donation has raised $11million for the realisation of Nigerian president of Igbo stock in 2023. “The OYC has already cemented agreement with middlebelt youths, who are co-ordinating the Igbo presidency project. Talks are on with Yoruba Council of Youths and Afenifere Youth leaders on the journey for Igbo presidency. “The Arewa Youth Consultative Youth Forum led by Alhaji Yerima Shettima has accepted to host our delegation by February 2020 in Arewa House Kaduna, for deliberation on the way forward.”
