Niger state Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello has instructed the state Ministry of Health to establish coronavirus emergency centers in six local government areas of Niger state. Bello stated this during reintroduction of the monthly sanitation exercise in Minna, Niger state. According to him, the state needs to be prepared and watchful for any eventuality especially as a case had already been reported in Lagos state. The local government areas where the coronavirus emergency centers would be established include Minna, Bida, Kontagora, Suleja and New Bussa. The Governor, however, said that the Ministry of Health had assured him of its capacity to contain and handle any outbreak should it happen in the state but stated the need for the state to be ready. The governor then urged the people to keep their environment clean to avoid the outbreak of diseases such as cholera. Speaking to The Nation, the Niger Commissioner for Health, Dr. Muhammad Maikusidi, expressed the alertness of the ministry of health in preventing the spread of the coronavirus in the state. He said that he will work at setting up the coronavirus emergency centers as directed by the Governor adding that the health surveillance Officers in all local government areas have already been adequately sensitized to report any suspected case within their vicinity. The Commissioner further stated that the surveillance level across the state has been raised a notch higher because of previous experiences of health situations in the state. “Because of our past experience, we have put our surveillance officers on alert. Our surveillance as at now is a notch higher than before.” He also said that there is an isolation center that is also being prepared in any case of an outbreak. “We are embarking on sensitization and awareness campaigns to residents and health workers were told to embark on health talks at every available forum”, he stated.
