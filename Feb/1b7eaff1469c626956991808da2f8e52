By Damisi Ojo, Akure A group, within the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ondo State, the Sunshine Mandate Group (SMG), led by Nigeria’s Ambassador to Togo, Olusola Iji has reacted to insinuation against the appointment of former APC National Chairman, Chief Adebisi Akande, as the Chairman of the APC National Reconciliation Committee. The group, in a communique by its coordinator, David Oyewole, said it would not allow the name of the former Osun State governor to be dragged in the mud as one of the leading lights in the camp of the progressives. A parallel group within the APC in the  state, the Unity Forum, otherwise known as estranged/aggrieved leaders, had at its meeting in Akure last week Tuesday rejected the reconciliation committee headed by Akande. But  SMG faulted the position of the Unity forum, describing it as embarrassing and ridiculous. The group said it would not fold its arms and allow some group of politicians to dent the image of Akande. It said the attack on the former governor is wicked and reckless. The statement reads: “For us at the Sunshine Mandate Group, led by Ambassador Olusola lji, we consider the position taken by the Unity Forum as being completely wrong and unwarranted. “We totally disagree with the insinuations made on Chief Akande. We consider it offensive. “While not condemning some of the germane points advanced in the communique, the SMG however condemns in strong terms the vote of no-confidence passed on Akande by the group. “We strongly believe that Alhaji Ali Olanusi –  a former party chairman, former deputy governor and highly respected elder statesman ought to know better than to travel along with others on the unpopular road chosen. ”The SMG considers it curious that a vote of no confidence could be recklessly passed on a distinguished leader of Akande’s calibre.”
