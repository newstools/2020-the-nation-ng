 AN Ado Ekiti High Court on Thursday sentenced a man, Bashiru Adeyanju, to 14 years in prison for attempting to defile his 17-year-old daughter. Delivering judgment, Justice Monisola Abodunde    did not give him an option to pay a fine. Abodunde, found the defendant guilty of the offence of attempted rape due to his  confessional statement and witnesses called during the trial. The judge held that the prosecution had proved its case beyond the reasonable doubt and established the case of attempted rape. “The Court finds you guilty as charged. But based on the plea of the defence counsel, describing him as a first offender, he is hereby sentenced to 14 years imprisonment “ she held. She said that the three years he had already spent in Jail should be subtracted from the jail term. Earlier, prosecution counsel, Mr Wale Fapohunda, who is also the Attorney-General of Ado Ekiti, said that the convict committed the offence on Sept. 10, 2017 at No 30, Irona Street, Ado-Ekiti. He added that the convict on the said date, unlawfully attempted to have sexual intercourse with his 17-year-old daughter.
