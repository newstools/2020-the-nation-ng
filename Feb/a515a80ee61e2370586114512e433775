Celebrities and friends of on-air personalities, Gbemi Olateru-Olagbegi and Tolu ‘Toolz’ Oniru-Demuren, recently came together to celebrate the premiere of the all-new season of their talk show, OffAir. The premiere which was hosted by popular media personalities, Toke Makinwa and Ebuka Obi-Uchendu, had in attendance media executives and celebrities like actresses: Adesua Etomi, Bisola Aiyeola, Beverly Naya, Osas Ighodaro, media personalities; Maria Okan, Osi Dirisu, Oreka Godis, Latasha Ngwugbe, artistes: Falz, Banky W, Mocheddah, and executives: Steve Babako, Ayeni Adekunle, Debola Williams and John Ehiguese, amongst others. With the new season of OffAir, Gbemi and Toolz promise even more drama, laughter and shade as they take on the latest in entertainment, lifestyle, dating, relationship, marriage and even sex. OffAir is one of the rare examples of radio personalities responding to an organic demand for specific content and leveraging that content to build a secondary independent brand. Gbemi and Toolz have shows that follow each other on their time slots at Beat FM and as a joke, they began to do a ‘handover’ show where they would banter with each other and discuss one or two topics in that 5 – 15-minute time slot.
