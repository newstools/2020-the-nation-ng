 NATIONAL President, University of Uyo Alumni Association, Onofiok Luke, has promised better days for  former students of the university. Onofiok made the pledge during a special congress of the alumni, which held at the 1000-seater capacity Conference Hall at UNIUYO permanent site. The congress came barely a few weeks after Onofiok took over the reins of leadership of the body. He called on former students to partner him to reposition the association. He emphasised the need to chart a new course for their alma mater and ensure a revival of her lost glory. “Today, I stand tall knowing full well that you are ready and willing to partner my administration for a reconciled, repositioned and refreshed UNIUYO Alumni Association. “It is time we rolled up our sleeves, get into the muddy gutter to clear the debris that has been in the wheel of progress of our great alma matter. There can be no better time than now to be part of this association,” he said. Luke reiterated the resolve of his administration to run an open-door administration with probity, transparency, accountability and humanity. “As a team, we will run an inclusive, accountable and transparent alumni association which shall ensure all matters are conducted in line with popular will and utmost probity. We will also ensure that all the lofty ideas and initiatives left by preceding administrations for the benefit of the alumni and our alma mater. Feel free to contact us with useful input and programmes that will benefit all of us. Together, let us build a UNIUYO of our dream. God bless us all.” A few weeks ago, UNIUYO Alumni Association  elected a new leadership which produced Onofiok.
