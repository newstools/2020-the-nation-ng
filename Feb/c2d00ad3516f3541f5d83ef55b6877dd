 A Federal High Court in Abuja has granted bail to former Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Mohammed Adoke (SAN) and his co-defendant, Aliyu Abubakar. Justice Binta Nyako, in a ruling on Monday, granted both men bail on the conditions attached to an earlier bail granted them by a High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) in Gwagwalada, before which they were earlier arraigned on another charge. The ruling by Justice Nyako on Monday was in respect of their arraignment earlier on Monday on  a six-count charge of money laundering and related offences, brought by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The High Court of the FCT, presided over by Justice Abubakar Kutigi, had in a ruling on January 30 this year, granted bail to Adoke and Abubakar at N50million and a surety each. Each of the sureties, Justice Kutigi said, must be resident in Abuja and has property in Abuja which must worth the bail sums imposed on the defendants individually. The defendants were also to deposit their travel documents with the court and must not travel outside the court’s jurisdiction without its permission. Justice Nyako adopted these convictions in her ruling a moment ago.  Details Shortly…
