 A MAGISTRATE’S Court, sitting in Abakaliki, the Ebonyi state capital, on Friday arraigned one Christopher Ajah, a lawyer, over an alleged involvement in kidnapping. The accused, it was gathered, aided a kidnap suspect, one Agbo Friday, to escape from prison custody. According to police prosecutor, ASP Mathias Eze, Ajah committed the offence on February 5, 2020, at the Magistrate’s Court 1, Abakaliki, in the Abakaliki Local Government Area, of the state. He was arraigned before the Magistrate’s Court, on Friday, on one count of kidnapping. The prosecutor, Eze, told the court that the offence was punishable under section 18 (3) of Ebonyi State Internal Security Enforcement and other Related Matters laws Cap. 55, Vol. 2, Laws of Ebonyi State of Nigeria, 2009. The defence counsel led by Mr Festus Nweke raised a point of preliminary objection to the charge, on the ground that the mandatory provision requiring that the consent of the Attorney-General of the state was not first sought and obtained by the Prosecution, failure of which rendered the one count charge incompetent. The court, presided over by Nnenna Onuoha admitted the accused to bail in the sum of N10,000.00, with one surety in like sum. The case was adjourned till March 30, 2020, for mention.
