Egypt’s Ahmed Saleh turned back the hand of time after the veteran dug deep to beat Nigeria’s Aruna Quadri 4-3 in the final of the 2020 ITTF Africa Top 16 Cup in Tunis. Saleh whose last continental title was in 2012 gave the Nigerian hard time as he tactically stood between Quadri and a third title. Saleh knew he had to start well and he did that by winning the first game at 11-6. Quadri fought back in the second game to win 11-5. Both players were evenly-matched but it was the Egyptian that won the tie 4-3 (11-6, 5-11, 11-9, 6-11, 11-9, 9-11, 11-3) to win the title. An excited Saleh described the victory as awesome. “I am very happy because I could not imagine that I will go past Aruna in this tournament. All I did was to focus from the first point to the last,” he said. He added: “I really don’t want to quit at 40. I want to play until my body cannot do it anymore. I love table tennis and I will continue.” For Quadri, Saleh deserved the victory. “I did my best but today belongs to him, he did very well,” he said. In the women’s singles, Egypt’s Dina Meshref beat Nigeria’s Offiong Edem 4-1 to retain her title. “When I started the competition, the plan was to stay focused, play my game and not think about how many times I had won the competition. I must commend Edem because she is an experienced player who played extremely well. She changed tactic every time which sometimes make it difficult to play against her,” admitted Meshref.
