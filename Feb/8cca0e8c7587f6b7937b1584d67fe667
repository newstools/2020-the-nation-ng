Super Eagles striker Alex Iwobi said he has become a “new man” and “more hunger” than at any stage of his career since his arrival at Everton. The 23-year-old joined Everton from Arsenal in the closing hours of last summer’s transfer window and has featured 17 times in the Premier League this term. His return from a six-week injury layoff last Saturday coincided with Everton’s dramatic 3-2 success against Watford – a victory which Iwobi reckons can turn his team’s fortunes for the campaign. Iwobi had been side-lined since sustaining a hamstring injury against Arsenal on the day Carlo Ancelotti was appointed Everton manager in December. Ancelotti insists his team’s spirit is chiefly responsible for them claiming 14 points from the Italian’s opening seven games in charge. And it is that same quality Iwobi has picked up on since swapping north London for Merseyside six months ago. “This is a whole different game for me,” Iwobi told evertontv. “The Evertonians here, not just the players but the fans and staff… everyone wants to give 100 per cent. “I am enjoying that side of the game; it has made me a new man in that sense. “I wasn’t particularly like that [before coming to Everton] but I have had to buy into it and show more hunger when I am playing and towards the fans.”
