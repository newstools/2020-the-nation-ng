By AbdulGafar Alabelewe, Kaduna  The House of Representatives has asked the management of the Bank of Agriculture (BOA) to appear before it to clear issues on the Federal Government’s Anchor Borrowers Programme (ABP). BOA is also asked to appear before the House Committee alongside all the farmers who took loans from the bank under the Anchor Borrowers Programme. The House Committee on Agriculture issued the summon in Kaduna on Friday when it paid an oversight visit to the headquarters of the bank in Kaduna. Members of the committee during the visit expressed dismay that, beneficiaries of the Anchor Borrowers Programme have complained bitterly to the their committee about BOA’ s handling of the ABP fund, saying that, there about 30 petitions on the Committee’s table against BOA. A member of the Committee and member of the House of Representatives representing Bama/Ngala/Kalabalge Constituency from Borno State, Dr. Zainab Gimba, raised concern that farmers from the North-East like Dili-Biu, Daru Farm, Gorea Farm, Shiltam Farm and Dr. Mohammed Dogo, were not happy with the BOA. She pointed out that, the farmers have complained to her office and the Committee that, they were finding it difficult to access loan under ABP from BOA. Gimba who lamented that the BOA seems to be frustrating the Federal Government’s efforts towards resettling the people of the North-East affected by the insurgency, through agriculture, said the bank needs to go back to its core mandate. Responding, the Managing Director of BOA, Kabir Adamu stated categorically that, the North-East as part of Federal Government’s plan to support the people affected by insurgency, has benefited more from the Anchor Borrower Programme than any other part of the country. He said, it is a total lie to say that, the BOA has not been releasing fund to the farmers in the North-East, saying that, many of the farmers have taken loan in billions of naira under the Anchor Borrowers Programme without paying back.
