By Sampson Unamka Last weekend, HKN Chairman, Adewale Adeleke, who is the elder brother of DMW boss, Davido, tied the knot with his long-time girlfriend, Kani, at the Emirates Palace Hotel, Abu Dhabi, UAE. The couple got engaged last year July, and held their introduction at Kani’s family residence in Calabar, Cross River. Over the weekend, the couple alongside members of the family, friends, well wishers, including Bukola Saraki and other royalties stormed Abu Dhabi for the lavish white wedding.  Davido, Tunji, Bayo, Sina and Rico who represented the groomsmen in grand style all rocked black suits and white shirts to match. A source who graced the wedding stated that one of the special moments was probably when Adewale’s mum talked about him and brought back memories about his growing up.
