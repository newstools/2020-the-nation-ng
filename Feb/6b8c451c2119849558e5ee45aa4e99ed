The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Command on Tuesday intercepted $8,065,612 (about N2,929,685,309.79) in 20 sealed wraps at the airport. Col. Hameed Ali (retd.), Comptroller-General of NIS told journalists at the airport that the consignment was packed in a coaster bus and loaded in six Bagco sacks with one suspect arrested in connection with the sum. According to him, the consignment was intercepted at about noon on January 16, 2020 at the E-Wing of the tarmac of the airport. He said that the command was able to intercept the sum through credible information gathered on the day the consignment was supposed to be moved out of the country. He explained further that the service was investigating the incident to determine the owners of the cash, adding that the fund and the arrested suspect would be handed over to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for further interrogation. He explained that names were written on each wrap of cash packed in $100 bills. He said that it was not a crime to ferry money out of the country, but that any amount of money in excess of $10,000 must be declared to Customs.
