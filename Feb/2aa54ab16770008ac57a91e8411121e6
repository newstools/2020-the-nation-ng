Ninety-five persons have been charged to court for crossing the expressway by the Lagos Environmental Sanitation Corps (LAGESC), the agency said on Thursday. LAGESC Corps Marshal Gbemisola Akinpelu, a retired Police Commissioner disclosed while warning residents to desist from crossing the highways in areas where padestrian and overhead bridges exist, a statement by the agency’s Public Affairs Officer (PAO) Kehinde Adebayo said. According to him, Akinpelu reiterated the government’s stance on ensuring sanity in the environment, warning that no one caught violating the law would be spared. He said the 95 persons who were arrested between January and yesterday, were prosecuted under the Environmental Sanitation Protection Law, 2017 at the Special Offences Court of Lagos State (Mobile Court), Bolade-Oshodi. “The Corps Marshal also decried the unfounded rumour circulating in the social media that the state government has directed LAGESC officials not in uniform to arrest people crossing the highways, saying that every LAGESC officer on lawful duty must be officially dressed with their name tags boldly seen on their uniforms. “She warned impostors extorting money from the public in the name of LAGESC to desist from such act and advised rumour peddlers to abstain from misleading the public with wrong information,” he said.
