 Over 12,000 new students have taken the oath of matriculation for a full-time programme at the University of Calabar. Speaking at the event, the Vice-Chancellor, Prof Zana Akpagu, congratulated the students for scaling admission hurdles. Akpagu said more than 40,000 applicants made UNICAL their first choice in the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME), adding that only 12,240 candidates scaled admission hurdles. Akpagu reminded the freshers of task ahead of them, advising them to abide by the school rules and regulation. He said: “It is a great challenge to all of you, who have been given admission, to live up to expectation and defend your admission by working hard and passing your examinations very well.  You are expected to keep to the rules and regulations of the school, bearing in mind that ignorance is no excuse for defaulters.” He warned that students must have 75 per cent lecture attendance to be allowed to write examination. He urged matriculating students to make their parents/guardians proud by being responsible and working to become the best in their respective classes. “You must keep before you always the very reason while you are here. Know always that your admission offers you a life time opportunity which you mustn’t waste” he added. Mr. Gabriel Egbe, the Registrar, enjoined the new students to utilise and make good use of the school e-library for research. He said management had provided conducive environment for the students to excel in their studies. Jane Etah, who was offered admission into the Department of Microbiology, could not conceal her joy, pledging to abide by the oath of matriculation.
