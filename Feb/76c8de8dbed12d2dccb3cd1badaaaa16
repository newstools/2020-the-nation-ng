Speaking in Ibadan over the weekend at the finals of the maiden edition of Oyo Unity Cup, Yobo affirmed: “It’s a good concept by the Minister. It is refreshing that he has put something together within a short time of being in office. I watched the opening game in Ogbomosho and the final was very interesting.  Football is the biggest unifying factor in Nigeria and what the minister is doing is commendable”. Yobo further said: “I want to commend and encourage the Minister.  Since this is the maiden edition, hopefully in subsequent editions, we hope to see new visions and ideas implemented.” Speaking on whether the standard of the competition   is capable of producing new talents, Yobo asserted, “Of course, I saw talented players. In the first game I saw two outstanding players. I think it’s very interesting and that’s why we are here. Having played football at the highest level, some of us have eyes for spotting good players within 10 minutes of play. I have seen talents here and that’s why I commend the Minister.” Ogooluwa Local Government defeated Ibarapa Local Government area 1-0 in extra time to win the competition.
