The Minister of Aviation, Sen. Hadi Sirika, says the Federal Government’s plan to float a national carrier is still on course. Sirika made this known in Abuja, at the Seventh edition of the aviation workers’ week, with the theme “Contributions of a National carrier to the socio-economic development of Nigeria.” The Minister, who was represented by Director of Planning Research Statistics (PRS) in the ministry, Mr. Muhammad Shehu, said the actualisation of the national carrier would create jobs to boost the nation’s Gross Domestic Products (GDP). Sirika commended the ministry`s efforts in resuscitating and redefining the operational modality of the national carrier. According to him, “Our focus to fly national carrier is still on course, despite what we read in the media. “At this juncture, permit me to salute the creative instinct and reflective intelligence of the joint council in the choice of the theme and efforts put in place to organise this traditional but important event.” “I am humbled by your invitation, supportive spirit and a high sense of responsibility. Management can only look forward to lending more support in your future activities.” Chairman of Joint Consultative and Negotiating Council, Mr. Hector Nnadi, said the objective of the programme was to examine management-labour relationship and map way forward for industrial harmony at the workplace environment. “Over the time, we had to move beyond the fast-fading concept of union and management interactions to more relevant and impactful themes, generally viewed as more contemporary in the aviation industry. “Motivated by the need for systematic examination and cross fertilisation of ideas, opinions and views with respect to cherished national ideal by aviation professionals, the annual seventh edition theme actually emerged.’’ “The concept is anchored on the desirability or otherwise of a national carrier’s contributions to the socio-economic growth of our fatherland,” Sirika said.
