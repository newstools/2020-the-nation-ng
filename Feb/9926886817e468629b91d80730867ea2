Butcher chief, Taiwo Olanase, has sought the protection of the police over an alleged attempt on his life. Olanase, who claimed that he is the Chairman of the Butchers Association in Badagry Local Government said some members of the association planned to kill him. He said they had earlier attempted taking his life, thanking God for his survival. Olanase, who spoke with The Nation, said he was at the Odo Eran (butchers’ market) when some group of fellow butchers stormed the place and started attacking him and others. He said: “I’m a butcher at Badagry under Olohunda Local Council Development Area (LCDA). We were engaging in sanitation at Odo Eran when my fellow butchers from the opponent brought cutlasses and started attacking us. They said I should leave that river that they don’t want me there. “I told them the river doesn’t belong to them; it is the government that asked us to clean the river so that they can open it for us in December. They started beating me and chased others away. They stabbed me with bottles and macheted me with cutlasses. I was stabbed in the neck and on the head. They left me to die before some police officers came to rescue me.” According to him, the officers took him to Area K Police Command, where he was asked to make a statement. Asked why he didn’t mobilise his supporters for revenge, Olanase said the leaders of the association warned him not to retaliate. “We are the followers and when our leaders said we should not fight back, we have to obey them. When I notified them when the issue started, our leaders said we should not fight. They chased our people with cutlass and bottles until I was left alone before they started stabbing me. Last Tuesday, they came to meet me at home to kill me. I can’t sleep in my house. I cannot feed my wife and kids now because I couldn’t go anywhere,” he said.
