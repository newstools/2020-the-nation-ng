By TOBA AGBOOLA  The Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics (ASUP) has urged the Federal Government to constitute a committee that will renegotiate the agreement it entered into since with the group 2010. ASUP’s new President Anderson Ezeibe, who spoke with reporters in Abuja, said: “We are worried because we do not see any form of sincerity, if this level of insincerity is demonstrated at the point of negotiation or renegotiation, then it means that there is no guarantee that we are going to have it implemented.” The group decried the non-composition of a visitation panel to federal polytechnics in line with the recent Federal Polytechnic Amendment Act 2019.  “Periodically, the government sends visitation panels to go and see how these institutions are faring but as we speak, we have forgotten the last time a visitation panel visited federal polytechnics,” he said. He added that if these key issues are not addressed, that may affect industrial harmony in the system. The polytechnics lecturers however expressed hope that their concerns would be addressed as a matter of urgency.
