 The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) has apologised for the fire incidents that saw a 150MaVA transformer burnt at Ayede, Akinyemi, Ringroad, Ibadan, Oyo State. The company acknowledged that the incident, which will lead to blackout in some parts of Oyo, Osun and Ogun states, being served by the transformer, is being addressed by the team of engineers. It promised that power would be restored immediately the cables were sorted out. TCN Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer Mr. Usman Muhammad gave the assurance of the restoration when he visited the sub-station to access the level of damage and ensure immediate solution is proffered. Represented by the Head, Transmission Service Provider, Mr. Victor Adewunmi, the CEO said that the protection relay installed on the transformer helped to shut down the remaining three transformers and prevented them from being affected by the fire.
