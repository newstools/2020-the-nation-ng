Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki has not been accused of corruption despite the crisis in All Progressives Congress (APC), the party has said. The spokesman, Joseph Osagiede, in Benin, said Obaseki’s detractors have not pointed out any act of corruption, which showed the governor is doing well. Osagiede, who explained why the party called for a fast today, said the prayer and fasting is to be done individually and not at any gathering. He stressed that the election was not worth the blood of any individual. The spokesman said the party wanted to pray before meeting the Chief Bisi Akande committee set up to resolve conflicts in the party. “We are calling for fasting and prayers in view of the crisis in the state. We don’t want a continuation of the crisis. No meaningful development can take place in an atmosphere of rancour. We are going to pray to God to change the mind of all those trying to make Edo ungovernable.”
