 A THIRTY-one-year-old man, Adamu Gaji, has been sentenced to three yearsâ€™ imprisonment for stealing two cows valued at N700,000. The cows were said to be the property of one Mr. Ogieriaki Omoruyi. Omoruyi was said to have employed the services of Adamu to take care of the cows, but Adamu went into the bush with the cows and never returned. Police Prosecutor Patrick Agbonifo, an ASP, told the court that the convict committed the offence on June 10, 2019 at Amagbe community. Agbonifo said the offence contravened the provision of section 390(8 (9) of the Criminal Code Cap. 48 Vol. 11, Laws of the defunct Bendel State of Nigeria, 1976, now applicable in Edo. Magistrate Awawu Osayande found Adamu guilty of one count of stealing filed against him.
