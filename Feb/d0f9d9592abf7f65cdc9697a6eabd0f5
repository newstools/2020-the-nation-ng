The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) in Kaduna State has arrested two suspects, Bashir Muhammad and Tukur Usaini, for allegedly being in possession of 1,760kg (1.8 tonnes) of Indian hemp also called cannabis sativa, concealed in a truck. The state Commander of NDLEA, Mr. Bala Fagge made the disclosure while briefing newsmen in Kaduna on Thursday, News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports. He said that the command intercepted an articulated vehicle transporting the illicit drug from Akure,  Ondo State, to Zaria, Kaduna State. “The suspects were conveying the banned substance in a trailer from Ondo State through a hidden route that passes through Birnin Gwari to Funtua in Katsina State and finally to Zaria, Kaduna State. “Their illegal routes clearly show that they were distributing the drugs to bandits and criminals in the forest,”Fagge said. He said that the two suspects, Muhammad, who is the driver of the vehicle and Usaini, the recipient of the drug, have been arrested and investigations are ongoing. He commended the Kaduna State government for providing the command with two new Peugeot pick-up vehicles and their immense support and contributions towards making the state free of drugs. The Kaduna State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, said that the vehicles provided by the state government would help the agency  in the discharge  of its duties.
