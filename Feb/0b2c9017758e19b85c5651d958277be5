 THE Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST) and the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) yesterday agreed to work out a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on financial inclusion and other areas that would drive the digital economic agenda of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration. To achieve this, the two agencies under the Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy have set up a committee to work out the details of the MoU. The agencies agreed to partner in other areas such as verifications of addresses of Subscriber Identification Module (SIM) card owners, Internet access for people in rural areas and provision of e-governance services to the people in all the local government councils of the country. The Postmaster-General and Chief Executive of NIPOST, Mr. Adebayo Adelusi, who led other members of the board of NIPOST to the NCC headquarters in Abuja, said NIPOST was going through a difficult phase at the moment and would need to partner with NCC to leverage available opportunities. He said his predecessor fought tooth and nail on the right of NIPOST to the ownership and collection of stamp duty, but that up till now the matter had not been resolved.
