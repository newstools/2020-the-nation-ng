 Some of the Boko Haram fighters that carried out the deadly attack in Garkida community in Adamawa State have been reportedly neutralised by Nigerian Air Force fighter jets in Sambisa forest in Borno State. The air strikes also destroyed some of the terrorists’ structures and logistics facilities at Garin Maloma and Parisu in Sambisa forest general area. According to a statement by the Director Public Relations and Information, Nigerian Air Force, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, “the Nigerian Air Force (NAF), through the Air Task Force (ATF) of Operation LAFIYA DOLE, has destroyed some Boko Haram Terrorist (BHT) structures and logistics facilities at Garin Maloma and Parisu in the Sambisa Forest general area of Borno State. “The air strikes were executed on 23 and 24 February 2020 as part of the ongoing Operation RATTLE SNAKE 3 based on credible intelligence reports indicating that elements of the BHTs that carried out the attack on Garkida in Adamawa State originated from camps within the Sambisa Forest. “Consequently, the ATF dispatched its attack aircraft to engage both locations, destroying several structures housing the terrorists as well as some of their logistics stores, which were seen engulfed in flames. “The NAF, operating in concert with surface forces, will sustain its air campaign to shape the battlespace in the Northeast for the effective conduct of further ground and air operations”.
