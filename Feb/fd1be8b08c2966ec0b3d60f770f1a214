Fidelity Bank Plc has expanded the scope of the Fidelity Youth Empowerment Academy (YEA) to accommodate new areas of vocational training. The bank in strategic partnership with Gazelle Academy started the seventh edition of the YEA at the Sokoto State University (SSU), Sokoto. Apart from the training on tailoring and make-up, participants will also be provided with requisite skills and first-hand knowledge in Fashion Designing, Cloth Embellishment, Cocktail and Phone Engineering among others. Over 200 undergraduates of SSU will benefit from this programme. So, why does the bank invest in young people? When the Fidelity Bank says, “turn your passion into a pay cheque”, that’s a message of empowerment. As a bank, it recognises that the youth look at the world with fresh eyes and such lively determination, and create much-needed change by throwing convention out the window. That’s why the bank, through its laudable interventions, continues to develop innovative programmes that unleash the creative energies of Nigerian youths which in turn represents formidable new frontiers for sustainable national development, says Fidelity Bank Managing Director, Nnamdi Okonkwo. YEA is a skills acquisition, training and productivity improvement scheme targeted at youths, especially undergraduates in higher institutions. This empowerment programme, which is part of the bank’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives, is primarily targeted at creating a new breed of entrepreneurs among Nigeria’s boisterous youth population. Over 3,000 students have benefited from YEA programmes at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka; Waziri Umar Federal Polytechnic, Birnin-Kebbi; Federal Polytechnic, Oko, Anambra State; Rivers State University of Science and Technology, Port Harcourt; Bayero University, Kano and Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka.
