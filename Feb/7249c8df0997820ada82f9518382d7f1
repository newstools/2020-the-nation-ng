 OVER 100 golfers representing various companies swarmed the golf section of Ikoyi Club 1938 yesterday morning to compete for the most prestigious gold medal in the Nigeria Oil and Gas Industry Games (NOGIG). It was a moment to cherish as CEOs and top management staff of the various companies exchanged pleasantries in a convivial atmosphere. The Executive Secretary, NCDMB, Simbi Wabote took the ceremonial tee off on behalf of the Minister of Petroleum. Luke Anene, MD Pipeline and Storage Company also took the ceremonial tee off on behalf of the Group Managing Director of NNPC Alhaji Mele Kolo Kyari while Tony Attah, MD Nigeria Liquified Natural Gas also took the ceremonial tee off. Speaking after the event, Luke Anene said it was good that golf, being a sport for gentlemen was included in the NOGIG. He said that the essence of NOGIG is being amplified on the golf course as key actors in the oil and gas industry were being brought together to compete under the most friendly atmosphere. On his part, Tony Attah, MD, NLNG said, “the philosophy of the Nigeria Oil and Gas Industry Games should be celebrated because it keeps the industry together and enhances the positive camaraderie between the different companies. “Without NOGIG, the tendency is for the companies to compete against one another only on the business front.”
