Following the decision by the Supreme Court to review its judgement that sacked Emeka Ihedioha as the governor of Imo State, elder statesmen in the state have hailed the Apex Court for fixing a date for the review of the judgement. The Supreme Court, it was learned, fixed February 18 as the date to hear the application by Ihedioha for review of the judgement which pronounced Senator Hope Uzodinma as the duly elected governor of the state. Addressing a press conference in Owerri on Friday, the elders, who spoke under the auspices of the Guild of Imo State Elders commended the Chief Justice of the Federation and the Supreme Court for the courage to look into Imo on Tuesday February 18, 2020. According to Prof. Francis Dike (SAN), “We called you here to show our gratitude to the CJN and the Supreme Court. As elders, the interest of Imo State is paramount to us. It’s on this premise that we thank the learned justices for their courage. We have unshakable belief in the Supreme Court”. Presenting a communique on behalf of the elders, Chief Peter Mgbenwelu said: “We have unshakable belief in the Supreme Court as the greatest force for the good of Nigerian people and it stands as the pinnacle of other arms of government and should be above suspicion. “It is for this reason that we are pained by the avalanche of reactions both at home and abroad on the judgement. The justices in their own words have said they are final not because they are infallible but will in some circumstances review their finality in the interest of society and of the court. “This takes courage which we applaud and also pray that the best wishes and interest of Imo electorate wins.”
