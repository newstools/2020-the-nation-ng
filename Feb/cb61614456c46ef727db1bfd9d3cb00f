 UNITY Bank Plc has partnered Nigerian cashew farmers under the auspices of the Association of Cashew Farmers, Processors and Aggregators of Nigeria (ACFAP) to boost production and drive export. The bank, which is reputed for its focus on the Agribusiness value chain, partnered ACFAP to host a stakeholders’ and export summit intended to promote cashew processing and export in Lagos last week. Nigeria is currently the sixth largest producer of cashew in the world, with the country producing an estimated 350,000 metric tons of cashew nuts and generating over $813 million in foreign exchange earnings over the past three years, according to the Minister of Agriculture, Sabo Nanono who delivered a keynote address at the summit. The bank’s partnership is expected to provide funding opportunities for farmers to boost production to about 500,000 metric tons over the next three years. Speaking on what inspired the bank’s partnership, the Managing Director/CEO of Unity Bank Plc, Mrs. Tomi Somefun stated that the support of ACFAP reinforces the bank’s long-standing commitment to the provision of funding for commercial farming, out-growers’ schemes for small holder farmers and various commodity associations. “The summit has enabled us to re-engage with stakeholders to better appreciate where funding needs are most required now and in the medium term, to optimally develop the sub-sector for the benefit of the economy at large,” said Somefun who was represented by the bank’s Head of Agribusiness, Mrs. Patricia Ahunanya.
