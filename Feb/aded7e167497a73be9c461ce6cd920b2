 AN Igando Customary Court, Lagos on Monday dissolved the 39-years-old marriage of a 58-year-old businesswoman, Janet Ayoola, for denying her husband, Olajide Ayoola, sex for seven years. The court’s president,  Adeniyi Koledoye,  granted the request of the estranged husband after efforts to save the marriage proved abortive. The president ordered Olajide to pay a severance of N200, 000 to Janet for her to move on with her life. Olajide, 70, had approached the court to terminate his marriage with Janet, who he accused of starving him sex. He said: “Janet who stays under the same roof with me refused me to make love to her for seven good years. She will not even allow me to touch her, let alone sleep with her.” Ayoola, a pensioner, said his wife wanted to terminate his life so as to inherit his property. He said his wife was “attacking him both physically and spiritually”. According to him, Janet was ungrateful that he had established businesses for her several times but the businesses collapsed due to her inability to m Janet on the other hand, who pleaded not guilty to the allegations, made a plea to the court not to terminate their marriage that she still loved her husband. The mother of four said she did not starve her husband of sex, but that he chased her to another room on the excuse that she snores. According to her, she never made any attempt to kill her husband nor instigated any of their children against him. Janet told the court that her husband always refused her food for reason best to him.
