Osun State Governor Adegboyega Oyetola has said his administration has resolved to reposition the state for the betterment of the citizens. He said it is committed to securing future of the children and those unborn. Oyetola said the government remains committed to improving every sector, as its policies and programmes are driven by citizens’ needs. The governor spoke yesterday while receiving the report of the panel of the Education Policy Review Roundtable Summit at the Governor’s Office, Abere, Osogbo. He had constituted the panel led by a renowned educationist, Prof. Olu Aina, to look at some extant education policies in the state, with a mandate to review and come up with workable recommendations that could further improve the state’s education system. Quoting a renowned American author, John C. Maxwell, who has written many books on leadership, Oyetola, who noted that ‘a man must be big enough to admit his mistakes, smart enough to profit from them, and strong enough to correct them,’ said every responsible and responsive government must make people’s demands the basis of its policies and implementation. He said that the need to review the education policy was informed by the people’s demand, adding that the government would ensure full implementation of whatever that would improve the lots of the people and protect the future of children. “It was our desire to hearken to the yearnings and aspirations of the citizenry that necessitated this review in the first instance. ”As a government, our policies and programmes are driven by citizens’ needs. These needs, which were further validated by the United Kingdom Department for International Development’s (DFID)- funded Citizens Needs Assessment exercise in Osun State, were harvested during the Thank You Tour/Town Hall Meetings, where the people told us in plain language that they wanted some aspects of our educational policies removed, adjusted or improved upon.”
