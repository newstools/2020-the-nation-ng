European Union (EU) Ambassador to Nigeria Ketil Karlsen has urged politicians to show restraint in their quest for power. Karlsen spoke on Thursday in Benin when he visited Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Dan Orbih, and other party leaders. He appealed for peace in the governorship election, saying the EU was meeting with other parties on the same message. The ambassador advocated collaborative effort to amend the electoral law, and pledged EUâ€™s willingness to support the process. Karlsen explained that the EU had over 3,000 projects across Niger Delta and was partnering Edo State on many others. He noted the role of the EU in the repatriation of youths trapped along illegal migrant routes. The ambassador promised that EU would remain impartial in its operations, and urged parties and politicians to allow for transparent primaries, more participation by women and youths, and desist from hate speech.
