 NEYMAR has been named in the Paris Saint-Germain squad for today’s UEFA Champions League last-16 first leg at Borussia Dortmund, despite missing the French club’s last four games through injury. The world’s most expensive player has been struggling with a rib problem, but was expected to be fit in time for the game at Signal Iduna Park. The Brazilian missed last season’s surprise last-16 loss to Manchester United with a foot injury, while he also sat out the second leg of the defeat at the same stage of the competition by Real Madrid in 2018. Neymar was rested, along with Kylian Mbappe, for PSG’s remarkable 4-4 draw at Amiens in Ligue 1 on Saturday.
