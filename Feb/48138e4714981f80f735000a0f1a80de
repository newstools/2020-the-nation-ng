A Federal High Court in Lagos will on March 27, 2020 give judgment in a suit seeking the permanent forfeiture of $54,000 found in the domiciliary account of a firm, Asej Global Services, operated by one Ojo Temitope Francis. Justice Muslim Hassan fixed the date on Monday following a motion on notice by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). Justice Hassan had last August made an order for the temporary forfeiture of the $54,000 to the Federal Government, following an ex parte application by the EFCC. Monday, EFCC counsel S.I. Suleiman said the anti-graft body had since complied with the court’s order to publish the interim forfeiture order in The Nation newspaper, for anyone interested to see and come to court. Suleiman said since no one had come forward to oppose the application for the permanent forfeiture of the funds, the judge should order same forfeited to the Federal Government. The EFCC told the judge via a 20-paragraph affidavit that the funds were reasonably suspected to be proceeds of cyber fraud. The affidavit was deposed to by the Commission’s investigative officer, Peter Chidinma.
