IMO State will embark on a comprehensive maintenance work of Otamiri Headworks of the Owerri Regional Water Scheme as part of measures to guarantee  supply of potable water to residents of Owerri metropolis. A statement by the governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Oguwike Nwachuku, reads: “…there will be a temporary shutdown of the Water Scheme for 18 days to make way for repairs and eventually, uninterrupted flow of taps… ‘’The maintenance work will begin today and end on February 21. Maintenance work would entail dislodging of Raw water tank, Aeration Basin, Flocculation Basin, Sedimentation Basin, Filter Beds and replacement of media and nozzles, Clear Water Tank, Backwash Tank, and other variables inhibiting free flow of water. “The temporary shutdown is also an opportunity for the Governor Hope Uzodinma-led administration to replace the 900mm diameter main water transmission pipe to the city, among others. These maintenance activities were last done in 1996, and are necessary to enhance water production and distribution within the capital city.”
