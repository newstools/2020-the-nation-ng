The duo of Ojo John and Ajayi Kayinsola emerged as the fastest athletes in the Lagos State finals for the Maltina School Games concluded on Wednesday at the Sports Complex of the Yaba College of Technology (YABATECH). In what could be best described as a befitting climax, Ojo, a student of Ijaiye Housing Secondary School won the Senior Girls 100m with an impressive time of 12.69 sec while Ajayi was simply awesome as he raced to the first position in the Senior Boys category; breasting the tape in a remarkable time of 11.30sec. The Maltina School Games is one of the latest innovation from the stable of Nigeria Breweries Plc, targeted at reviving sports in schools; especially athletics which used to be one of the strongholds of the country. The National Trade Marketing Manager Nigerian Breweries Plc, Funsho Ayeni, expressed delight at the massive turnout of schools and more importantly with splendid performances recorded by the youngsters. “Of course we are very impressed with these huge turnouts as we had over 180 schools from the six Educational Districts here competing” “For us at Maltina aside from our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), our goal is to help with active kids and create happy moments like this and we are glad about the massive success we have recorded in Lagos.”
