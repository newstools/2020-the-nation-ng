The outbreak of coronavirus in Italy has sparked fears among residents in Edo State. This is because there is hardly any home in Benin City and environs that does not have a relative in Italy or other European countries. There is also weekly influx of goods to Edo from Italy. Italy is perhaps the first destination of choice for any young lady seeking to travel abroad or being trafficked. Some persons, who spoke after report of an Italian testing positive to coronavirus in Lagos State, said they have contacted their loved ones to ensure they were safe. Meanwhile the Edo State Government said it has commenced various activities to stop coronavirus from spreading to the state. Commissioner for Health, Dr. Patrick Okundia, told reporters in Benin City that a team has been deployed to the Benin Airport to get information on the manifest of the airline that brought the Italian into the country. Okundia said it has also sensitised staff at the Benin Airport on the screening modalities of air travellers as well as creating awareness for the public on the new coronavirus. Okundia added that health care workers across all health facilities in the 18 local government areas have been sensitised while surveillance officers have been placed on red alert to carry out active case search in all health facilities at all entry points. He further released phone numbers through which people could call for any information and report of suspected cases.
