Isolo Local Council Development Area (LCDA) has denied backing a group of protesters, who last Friday protested in Alausa, Ikeja urging the state government to ban commercial motorcyclists, otherwise called Okada riders, from operating on Ajao Estate. Speaking with The Nation yesterday, Secretary to the LCDA, Mr. Emmanuel Olojede, said the protesters were economical with the truth. He said that the LCDA did not discuss such request with anybody or groups in the council area. “The protesters should be disregarded because there was no time we had any discussion with any group to stage a protest over Okada ban or to request the ban on Okada in Isolo neighbourhoods. “The current administration in the LCDA has been very responsive when it comes to issues affecting the well-being of the residents of Isolo LCDA and it is on the strength of this that we earlier engaged stakeholders with a view to resolving the impasses over Okada operations on Ajao Estate. “The only road where Okada operators are restricted from plying on the estate is Osolo Way, which links Ajao Estate with Isolo. They were not banned from operating in other areas of the estate. Unfortunately, the elite are the ones backing the call for Okada ban on the estate, while the masses feel that those who have cars don’t want them to live in peace by denying them the opportunity to commute to their homes on Okada. “Isolo LCDA is not against regulations of the state government on Okada operations in some parts of our council area, but we will not unnecessarily punish people living in areas not captured under the Okada ban.” The elite and the masses voted us into office and we must take care of the well-being of all residents. Therefore, the protesters are not speaking for us or the entire residents of our LCDA.”
