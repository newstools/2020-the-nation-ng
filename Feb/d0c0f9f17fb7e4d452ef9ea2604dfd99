Manchester City’s long-term vision for Europe may be under threat and Liverpool’s lead at the top of the Premier League all but unassailable, yet Pep Guardiola could still write himself into the history books tomorrow if he becomes the first manager since Bob Paisley to win three successive League Cups. If that sounds more like a footnote to history than anything of greater significance it is because the early season knockout competition has diminished in importance in the intervening years, while City themselves are clearly set up for grander ambitions. Liverpool actually won four League cups in a row between 1981 and 1984 (Joe Fagan claimed the last) ending up with the Milk Cup when the competition gained a sponsorship for the first time in 1981-82. Given that City are one of the few clubs who take the League Cup seriously each year, putting out competitive sides and setting out to win, it is possible Liverpool’s record could be matched or even overtaken at some point, as long as what is now the Carabao Cup keeps going long enough to allow that to happen. There can be little doubt the League Cup is now regarded as a lesser prize than the one collected so regularly by Paisley’s team, which is one reason why City’s consistency over the past couple of years has not gained greater recognition.
