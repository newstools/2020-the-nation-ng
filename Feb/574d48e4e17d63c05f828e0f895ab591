By Tajudeen Adebanjo An official of the Lagos State Traffic Management Agency (LASTMA) has allegedly committed suicide. The body of the official simply identified as Akinde was seen dangling on a tree lifeless. He was said to have allegedly hung himself at Opebi near the popular Adebola House. None of the sympathisers could say what led to the action. The Nation learnt that he was recently redeployed from his Alausa base, but was not happy about the redeployment. A source close to the late Akinde said he was battling with mental illness. The source described the incident as tragic. “We don’t know what could have led to the incident. He was working at Alausa before his new posting. He did not hide his intention of not happy with the posting. Though, he was suffering from mental illness. I think only those closer to him knew that. It was a big tragedy for the LASTMA family, ” the source said.
