The positive impacts of those policies are obvious, even to the blind.  Ekiti is today a destination of choice for working, living and leisure for people within and without. “As the Chairman of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum, Fayemi has stabilised the body and made the Forum a partner in progress and development with the Federal Government. The Governors’ Forum under his watch is no longer a parallel government that is antagonistic to the federal authority.
