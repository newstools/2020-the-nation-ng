Our Reporter With players often raising their games against former clubs, Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer doesn’t think Watford’s visit to Old Trafford will make too much difference to Odion Ighalo’s performance tomorrow. Ighalo could start his first game and also make his home debut for the Red Devils after the deadline day loanee has made two substitute appearances since joining from Shanghai Shenhua in the last two games, against Chelsea in the Premier League and Club Brugge in the Europa League. With Anthony Martial jaded after starting both the Chelsea and the Club Brugge games and Mason Greenwood ill, Solskjaer has suggested strongly that Ighalo could be in line against the side that the former Nigeria International spent two and a half years with before sealing a big money move to China in January 2017. “Everyone says that when they score against their old team,” the Norwegian said when asked if Ighalo would raise his game. But there are also many games when you don’t score against your old team.” “Mason’s been ill,” he added. “Odion is getting more and more minutes, it depends on Mason as well as Martial’s availability.”
