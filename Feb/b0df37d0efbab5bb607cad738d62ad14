Our Reporter  The  National Executive of Borehole Master Drillers Association (AWDROP) has concluded plans with Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development, Sabo Nanono to assist in providing adequate water supply for rural farmers. The assistance is coming through a programme tagged: Agro-Rural Water Supply Support Initiative (ARUWASSI). Speaking during the meeting with the Minister, the National President, AWDROP, Michael Ale  noted that ensuring access to water  is essential to achieving  sustainable agricultural development  and commended the Federal Government’s readiness to explore underground water to address irrigation challenges. His words: “Nigerian farmers still find it difficult to practice all seasons farming, which makes it possible for farmers in developed countries to grow fruits, grains and, vegetables during the dry season. Farmers in the developed countries are able to achieve this because of effective management of groundwater. AWDROP has great expertise and potential in this area.  We are excited with the current partnership with the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development ( FMARD) though the ARUWASSI Programme.” He  added: “”This programme  has gained traction in the international groundwater fora and has received so much attention.” According to him, ground water has   powered countries to become self-sufficient in food production, and reduced poverty by creating jobs in rural areas. He also commended the National Assembly for approving the programme, adding that urgent changes are needed  on  the way water is used in farming. He reiterated the association’s  desire  to work with the ministry to ensure   the ARUWASSI Programme succeeds   for agriculture and rural livelihood.
