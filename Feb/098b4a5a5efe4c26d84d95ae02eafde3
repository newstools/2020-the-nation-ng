We want to see the commitment of State Governors to grassroots sports development. “Fifteen years after the last Sports Festival was held, we are having this, so there is a renaissance taking place and I am always very glad when I see the youth involved in sporting activities. “We are looking for young talents that we can nurture in athletics, weight lifting, boxing and I am really glad to be here.” The Minister assured of the readiness of team Nigerian in athletics for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics: “What happened on Friday with Tobi Amusan, who is now globally seeded number two by IAAF which signposts the future of Nigerian athletics. “We have the Tobi Amusan, Ese Brume, Blessing Okagbare, Divine Oduduru. This country has one of the best relay teams about the third or the fourth in the world, we were second before and we are trying to reenact where we were before when it comes to relay.
