Facts have emerged on why President Muhammadu Buhari became emotional on Tuesday when he received in audience Emirs and political leaders from Niger State. It is simple: Niger State is a second home for Buhari because he can boast of 100 per cent support since his days in the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) through Congress for Progressives Change and All Progressives Congress (APC). When security report of the large-scale banditry in Niger State got to the President, he did not mince words in admitting that he was taken “aback.” He said: “I was taken aback by what is happening in the North-West and other parts of the country. During our campaigns, we knew about the Boko Haram. What is coming now is surprising.”
