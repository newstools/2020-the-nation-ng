Actress Regina Daniels keeps coming up with surprises. When the news of her marriage to Senator Ned Nwodo became public, it came as a shock. Some people didn’t understand the rationale behind her decision to marry a married man, but she seemed to know what she wanted and stuck to it regardless of the criticisms. Yesterday, she made another announcement, launching ‘Regina Magazine.’ Although this has nothing to do with her love life, being a publisher means the actress has successfully diversified into the media business. She is also not a novice in the industry as she studied Mass Communication at Igbinedion University, Okada, Edo State. The unveiling party held at Ladi Kwali Conference Hall, Sheraton Hotel, Abuja, had in attendance top dignitaries from all walks of life. Regina Magazine is dedicated to celebrating Nigerian super divas and women who have succeeded in their endeavours. It is also designed to inspire the upcoming generations.
