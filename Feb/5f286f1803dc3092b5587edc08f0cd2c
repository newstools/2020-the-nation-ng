According to SephGlobalBoy, it is time to step up the game. “By the grace of God, 2020 we should headline’ The Global Boy Concert’ so help me God,” said the singer who started as a drummer in church. “The move is not just to perform but to officially headline a sold out shows in most of these venues includes Eko Hotel, the 02 Arena London, the Dome USA and others.” SephGlobalBoy, who described his genre of music as Afro Dance Hall said, if not that a prophet prophesied music as his career, he would have ended being a professional footballer.  “If I was not singing or a musician, no doubt I would be a footballer,” he said. “It is my second passion and I find love doing but a prophet gave me a prophesying to be a musician. So music is a calling for me.” On the impact of internet for upcoming acts, SephGlobalBoy said it has really helps grow his fan base, especially female ones and it also has contributed largely to the music industry as a whole. “The ratio of my fan base is 70/30 percent, ladies has 70 percentage due to my kind of sound, my look and my personality. I love them so much and I don’t joke with the love and support they offer me.” Though he admires a lot of artistes, SephGlobalBoy chooses Starboy honcho as his favourite musician. He explained: “Maybe because we are from same area in Surulere, Lagos, and I knew little about his struggle days. With what we are facing right now relating to his level of success, I think he is a living legend. I also like Burna Boy, Davido and many others are extra ordinary artistes worth admiring.”
