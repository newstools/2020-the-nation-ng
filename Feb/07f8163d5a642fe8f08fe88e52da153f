 THE National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) said yesterday that it would continue to wage war against persons involved in trafficking of persons in and outside the country. The agency’s Commander in Lagos State, Mr. Daniel Atokolo, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos that many youths had been trafficked to other countries. He said that the traffickers lured their victims outside the country on the pretext of offering them good employment opportunities there. Atokolo implored youths to do personal assessment of their qualifications to employments being offered them by most foreign benefactors. The NAPTIP commander said the agency was determined to ensure that victims of human trafficking received care and protection. He said that the command rescued 18 victims from their traffickers in 2018 and had been empowered with hair dressing and tailoring skills. “Sixteen victims were empowered with tailoring, catering and hair dressing skills and tools in 2019. “Also 10 victims have just begun skill acquisition training in tailoring and hair dressing,” he said. Atokolo said that some of the victims rescued by the command had gained admission into schools. He said that two victims had gained admission into the university and five others into secondary schools. He added that two others gained admission into primary schools, and another two gained admission into a nursery school. NAN reports that the agency rescued 3,000 Nigerians from being trafficked outside the country between 2018 and 2019. NAN
