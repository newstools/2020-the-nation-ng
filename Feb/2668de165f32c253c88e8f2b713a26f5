Nissan Nigeria under the dealership of Stallion Group has taken children from Motherless Babies Home and Vigilant Heart Orphanage to Silverbird Galleria to have a feel of privileged life. Head of Sales for Nissan in Nigeria Amit Sharma said the initiative was guided by the vision of enriching people’s lives. “Nissan Nigeria sets out to give a “fun day at the movies’ experience to the children of the charitable homes. It is our way of rendering exemplary service towards providing care for orphans and abandoned and underprivileged children in Lagos,” he said. According to him, about 70 children from the charitable causes were taken along with their care givers to watch a movie titled “Dr. Dolittle.” “The children’s enthusiasm was electric. The children were also made to watch short movies on road safety norms. This is one of the many activities that Nissan Nigeria– Stallion Group commits to carry out this year to inculcate safe driving culture in the young minds. “We seeks to contribute to sustainable social development and carries out social contribution activities as a corporate citizen focusing on education, environmental awareness and humanitarian relief,” he said.
