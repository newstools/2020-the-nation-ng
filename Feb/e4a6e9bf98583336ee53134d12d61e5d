Some leaders and indigenes of Iloro-Ekiti in Ijero Local Government Area of Ekiti State on Monday stormed the streets to protest against the newly installed Oluloro, Oba Femi Olugbesoye, for alleged despotic tendencies displayed against perceived opponents. The protesters, comprising chiefs, youths and women alleged that the monarch organised thugs, which he allegedly used to terrorise and harass residents that were opposed to his installation. The protesters, who marched round the town with traditional sticks called Apasa, which signalled the beginning of war, appealed to Governor Kayode Fayemi to depose the monarch and replace him with the preferred choice of the town, who can respect tradition and the subjects. Addressing reporters during the protest, the Aro of Iloro kingdom, Chief Samuel Agbaje, alleged that Oba Olugbesoye was forcefully imposed on the town by the government in cahoots with a first-class traditional ruler in Ijero Council, despite being rejected by Ifa divination and the town. Oba Olugbesoye, however, said the protesters were only engaging in senseless blackmail. He dispelled the allegation that he was imposed by interlopers, claiming that it was the turn of his dynasty to fill the vacant stool left by the departed Oluloro, Oba Olu Arowolo.
