 US President Donald Trump has said that he is considering an invitation from Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to attend the Tokyo Olympics. “I was invited by Prime Minister Abe, and we’ll make that determination,” Trump said during a meeting with members of the US Olympic Committee and organizers of the 2028 Los Angeles Games. “We might. We’re going to try.” The Tokyo Games are scheduled for July and August, which would mean Trump leaving the country during his campaign for re-election in November. Trump told Los Angeles organizers that he fully backs the 2028 Games, and claimed that his personal intervention as president-elect after his 2016 election victory clinched the hosting rights.
