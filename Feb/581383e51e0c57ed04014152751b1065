The drama in Bayelsa State is not yet over. Barely few hours after he emerged as the new governor of Bayelsa State, Sen. Douye Diri faces another battle, which may threaten his mandate. He has a new date with his arch-rival, Timi Alaibe, who has asked a Federal High Court to declare him as the validly nominated governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state. Many in Diri’s camp have been begging Alaibe, a former Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), to withdraw his case. But loyalists of Alaibe said their confidence has been buoyed by the nullification of the victory of the APC candidate, David Lyon, by the Supreme Court. They said since Lyon’s fate was sealed as a result of a pre-election matter, the new governor at best may be a caretaker. Alaibe’s camp is now banking on the Judiciary to restore the mandate of its candidate. They want Diri out. Nigerians are waiting to watch developments in the oil rich state.
