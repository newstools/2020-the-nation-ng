Sanni Onogu, Abuja  The Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, on Wednesday urged Governors and Local Government Chairmen across the country to always to take responsibility towards addressing insecurity in their domain instead of leaving everything to security agencies. Adamu said this while answering questions from reporters after over five hours of closed session meeting with the Senate in Abuja. He said that tackling insecurity should not be left for the police alone, as it is the responsibility of all. He insisted that other arms of government especially Governors and Local Governments Chairmen should always be responsive in addressing issues that could potentially lead to insecurity in their domain. Adamu said: Securities issues are fluid or dynamic. At a stage where you have a rise in crimes we re-strategize and deal with them and everywhere will be stabilized. “And for a period of time you will see stability in crime situation. But at another stage you will see the criminals re-strategizing and coming out to commit crime. “What we are saying especially with the concept of community policing is that fighting crime should not left to law enforcement agencies alone. “It should not be left to security personnel alone. Everybody should be involved. “What are the things that lead to the commission of crime? Are all issues to be dealt with by security agencies alone? No. “There are other arms of government that needs to deal with issues of security. State Governors, Local Government Chairmen should take up their responsibilities. “People that are committing these crime there are reasons that make them to commit these crimes. “If it is lack of employment, if it is lack of education or those issues that will require intervention by the government, the state Governor should take responsibility. “Local government chairmen should take responsibility. Not that everything will be left to security agencies alone.” Details later…
