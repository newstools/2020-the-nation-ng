  ALL is set for the  forensic udit of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) because the Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP) has approved the lead Consulting Firm, which may coordinate other auditors. This development is already causing panic because it may make or mar the political future of some stakeholders in the South-South. Although President Muhammadu Buhari is interested in following the humongous allocations,  the aftereffects have created jitters in the spines of many. Not even the soothing words of the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Chief Godswill Akpabio, could allay the fears of some past officers of NDDC. Notwithstanding, Akpabio said:  “The directives by President Muhammadu Buhari for the forensic auditing of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), is not to witch hunt anyone or group, but to ascertain what went wrong and put in place a governmental structure that will be result oriented”. “The Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP) has assessed the firm and found them fit to be the leading Consulting Firm that will lead the appointment of other forensic auditors for the NDDC audit spanning between 2001- 2019. We have received the approval of BPP to now commence the exercise. “The next task is to work in collaboration with the ministry to bring in experienced and notable forensic auditors with international reputation, so that whatever report is produced will be accepted and enforceable within and outside the country.”
