The six Houses of Assembly in the Southwest on Wednesday adopted a single legal document for the operation of the Amotekun security outfit across the region. Chairman of the Conference of Speakers of Southwest States Bamidele Oleyelogun broke the news after a meeting of the conference with the attorneys-general from the six states in Ibadan. Oleyelogun, who is the Ondo State House of Assembly Speaker, said the uniformity of the bill would ensure synergy of operation in terms of working relationship, intelligence sharing, training and others among the Amotekun Corps in the six states of Lagos, Oyo, Ondo, Ogun, Osun and Ekiti. He explained that the conference would not rest until an acceptable law, which will give full legal backing to the security outfit, is passed. At the meeting, the speakers and AGs were able to make observations, suggestions and clear conflicting areas identified during the public hearings conducted by each state. They did a clause-by-clause deliberation of the issues raised at public hearings. The meeting was convened to harmonise the different suggestions, observations and criticisms into the proposed law. At the meeting were speakers Adebo Ogundoyin (Oyo); Timothy Owoeye (Osun); Bamidele David Oleyelogun (Ondo); Mudashiru Obasa (Lagos); Funminiyi Afuye (Ekiti) and Olakunle Oluomo (Ogun). Aside attorneys-general, the meeting also had in attendance Majority leaders, clerks of the six Houses of Assembly, directors of Legal Departments and Chairmen, House Committees on Security among other functionaries of the legislatures in the region. The Houses of Assembly have been giving the bills accelerated consideration with a view to giving legal backing to the corps.
