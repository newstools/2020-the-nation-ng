Our Reporter  West Africa 4G LTE broadband service provider, Smile Nigeria, has commended MainOne and Globacom for partnering it to overcome the challenge posed by the disruption of internet services as a result of submarine cable cuts. Smile commended the two firms for “the relentless support both firms offered to the company to aid the quick delivery of additional capacity required during the recent WACS submarine fibre cut”. Speaking in Lagos, the Group CEO of Smile Communications, Ahmad Farroukh, said: “The huge demand for IP capacity from other operators in Nigeria during the unfortunate incident.” He lauded the commitment of MainOne and Globacom for making quick alternative arrangements with multiple upstream providers to accommodate the Smile telecoms network.  “We should take learnings from the recent WACS and SAT3 cable cuts that resulted in the disruption of internet services in the country.” He commended Communications and Digital Economy  Minister, Dr Ali Pantami and the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) on the new broadband target and the constitution of the National Broadband Committee. He appealed to the minister and NCC to facilitate an environment where all Nigerian and non-Nigerian cable providers will have active redundancy on each other so that consumers will not be impacted negatively in case of similar occurrence in the future. For example, if submarine cable X was subject to a cut, other cables existing in Nigeria should be able to carry on the lost capacity without negatively impacting the end users.
