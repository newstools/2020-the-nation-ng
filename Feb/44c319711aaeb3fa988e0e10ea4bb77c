Suspected assassins have reportedly murdered one Onovughe Jovi, son of late Delta hotelier, Chief Jovi, in Ekete area of Udu Local Government Area. The Nation learnt that the deceased was shot dead Tuesday night in the company of his mother, Agnes Jovi, who also sustained a bullet wound in the attack. Both were said to be returning to the hotel, Jovi Garden Hotel, located along Otor-Udu Road by Utuama Layout of the council area. Reports say their vehicle was ambushed along the Ekete Inland route, which leads to Ovwian/Aladja Police Station. The father of the deceased, Chief Jovi, had died sometime in 2019 after a brief illness. He is yet to be buried before the cold murder of the son, who had been managing the business. Details as to the cause of the killing were still sketchy at the time of filing this report. This brings the number of suspected assassination cases in the Delta Central district to two within the last one month. Efforts to get comments from the State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Hafiz Inuwa, were unsuccessful as his phone line was repeatedly busy when contacted. However, a source at the Ovwian/Aladja Police Station confirmed the incident. The source stated that “the deceased was shot dead while driving with his mother and no arrest has been made”.
