The Board of Directors of Nigerian Breweries (NB) Plc has decided to pay the entire net profit of N16.01 billion recorded in 2019 to shareholders as cash dividends for the business year. Shareholders will receive a total dividend per share of N2.01. The company had paid interim dividend of 50 kobo. The final dividend per share of N1.51 will be presented to shareholders for approval at the company’s annual general meeting in April 2020. Directors of the company stated that N12.07 billion will be distributed as final cash dividends in addition to N3.9 billion earlier paid as interim dividends. Key extracts of the audited report and accounts of NB for the year ended December 31, 2019 showed that turnover dropped marginally by 0.4 per cent from N324 billion in 2018 to N323 billion in 2019. Profit before tax dropped by 20.5 per cent to N23.3 billion in 2019 as against N29.4 billion in 2018. Profit after tax declined from N19.44 billion to N16.11 billion. With these, earnings per share dropped from N2.43 in 2018 to N2.01 in 2019. Company Secretary and Legal Director, Nigerian Breweries Plc, Uaboi Agbebaku, attributed the 2019 performance to the second instalment of the increased excise duty rates that came into effect during the year and a challenging operating environment. NB had also paid out the entire net profit of N19.4 billion recorded in 2018 as cash dividend to shareholders. The company had explained that its decision to pay out its entire net profit after tax as cash dividend to shareholders demonstrated its strong performance and confidence over its operations. However, the company had launched a new N100 billion Commercial Paper (CP) programme in 2018 after it completed its first N100 billion CP programme between 2015 and 2018. In 2019, NB raised N15 billion under the CP programme. The 90-day CPs carried effective and discount yields of 11.590 per cent and 11.2680 per cent respectively while the 182-day CPs carried 14.430 per cent and 13.4614 per cent respectively. Agbebaku had said the new CP programme would support the company’s cost management and complement traditional sources of financing to include non-bank financing options. He said the CPs also provide opportunity for non-equity investors to invest in the company.
