Nicholas Kalu, Abuja The Police Service Commission (PSC) has said there is no on-going recruitment of Cadet Assistant Superintendents of Police and Cadet Inspectors. This was made known by a statement by the Head, Press and Public Relations of the Commission, Ikechukwu Ani, on Wednesday evening. “The Commission notes that it is in possession of messages and requests to notable Nigerians informing them of a phantom recruitment exercise and asking them to send three names for recruitment. The messages were purported to have originated from the Honourable Chairman of the Commission, Musiliu Smith, a retired Inspector General of Police. “The fraudsters according to information in the Commission’s possession are requesting from their contacts, payments to some account names and numbers of different Nigerian banks. “The Commission is deeply embarrassed that fraudsters associate the name of the Commission’s Chairman with this fraudulent disposition. “It is also instructive to note that recruitment in the Commission is handled by the Commission as a body and not by individuals. The Chairman only chairs the meetings where decisions of the Commission, including that of recruitment are taken. “The Commission warns that Nigerians should beware of these fraudsters who are on the prowl to dupe unsuspecting citizens,” the statement read.
