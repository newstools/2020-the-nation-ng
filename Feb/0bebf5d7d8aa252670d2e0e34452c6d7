  Tottenham are facing an uphill battle to qualify for the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals after they suffered a 1-0 loss to RB Leipzig in the first leg of their last-16 tie at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Wednesday noght. Timo Werner scored from the penalty spot in the 58th minute after Ben Davies had fouled Konrad Laimer, but the final score could have been far worse for Jose Mourinho’s side had the visitors converted a string of early chances. RB Leipzig were totally dominant in the first half, pinning the hosts back and carving them open repeatedly, only to be thwarted by a combination of their own wasteful finishing and Hugo Lloris’s sharp reflexes. Spurs did improve after Werner finally broke the deadlock, with Giovani Lo Celso going closest when his curling free kick was tipped onto the post by RB Leipzig goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi, but it was too little too late, leaving them with a major task to overturn the deficit in next month’s second leg.
