Tottenham’s Heung-Min Son is expected to miss the rest of the season after suffering a broken arm at Aston Villa on Sunday. Son will require surgery on the injury, which happened in a first-minute challenge with Villa’s Ezri Konsa, despite going on to complete the match and scoring twice – including a stoppage-time winner in the 3-2 victory. A Tottenham press officer had said Son was expected to miss “a number of weeks”, but Jose Mourinho called that assessment “optimistic”. Asked if he expects Son to play again this season, Mourinho said: “I don’t. If he plays one game or two games, it’s because he’s (press officer) very optimistic.
