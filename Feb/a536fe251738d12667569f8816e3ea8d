After years of training, consistency and dedication, Zenera Consulting’s protégé on the golf scene, Monday Eze, has officially joined the league of professional golfers in Nigeria. Eze, who has been under the tutelage, mentorship and sponsorship of the Branding and Advertising firm, was on Friday, 21st February 2020, formally inducted into the Professional Golfers Association of Nigeria after emerging victorious in the Qualifying Exams. For four years, the organisation invested in Eze through several trainings to London, Kenya and other countries. They also sponsored his competitions as an amateur golfer within and out of Nigeria. With this new feat, Eze officially becomes eligible to play professionally, take up a coaching role or manage golf courses. He also officially enters a five-year endorsement contract with Zenera Consulting. Reiterating commitment to the young professional, Olowola said, ‘’We are still drumming support for Monday Eze on whatever path he decides to toe from here on, whether as a professional player, a coach or manager of the golf course. However, we encourage him to play professionally because he is a very smart golfer and Nigeria surely needs players like him.’’ “In addition to education and youth development, we have also elected to support the beautiful game of golf and we are therefore glad and fulfilled that our premiere protégé has reached this milestone in his career,” he added.
