The club and fans of Manchester United are still reeling in joy following the much anticipated debut of Nigerian striker Odion Ighalo in Monday’s 2-0 win over Chelsea in the English Premier League. The 30-year-old former Watford striker has been subject of intense scrutiny since he made his transfer deadline-day switch to Old Trafford from Shanghai Shenhua in the Chinese Super League. Sequel  to Monday’s night cameo role at Stamford Bridge, the club’s web site mounted a special gallery for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations(AFCON) top scorer appropriately tagged ‘ Ighalo Makes His Debut’ with some lively photos to boot. Besides, he was well mentioned  in the club’s ‘ Talking Points From United’s Win At Chelsea ‘ in a report well captured by William Plant thus: “Odion Ighalo may have been starting to think he wouldn’t make his debut with the Reds well on top and two goals up but the striker was eventually introduced in the 90th minute. “The Nigerian was greeted by a huge cheer from our supporters at the Bridge and although he was only on the pitch for a few minutes, he nearly opened his united account.” “Instead, he was incredibly unlucky to see his injury-time effort denied by Willy Caballero. What a start that could have been for our new recruit!” he noted.
