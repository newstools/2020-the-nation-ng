 TLcom, the Africa-focused venture capital firm, on Wednesday, announced that it has secured an additional $31 million for its TIDE Africa Fund, bringing its Sub Saharan Africa (SSA)-focused fund to $71 million. The firm, in a statement, said the latest investment round attracted international interest, with TLcom confirming participation from the United Kingdom (UK)-based CDC Group, International Finance Corporation (IFC) as well as South Africa’s Sango Capital and Belgium’s BIO. The team now expects to make an additional five to six investments in pan-African companies over the coming 12 to 18 months from seed to later stage, as well as ensure capital resources for follow-on rounds for TLcom’s existing portfolio. TIDE Africa is one of the most active funds operating in Sub Saharan Africa since its first close in 2017, with six companies in its portfolio, including Andela, Kobo360, Twiga Foods, Ajua, Terragon Group and uLesson. Over the last 12 months, rounds led or co-led by TIDE Africa had raised over $150 million for African startups. Last year, TLcom Capital was named “Africa Technology Investor of the Year” at the PE Africa Awards. Speaking on the new investments in its TIDE Africa Fund, Nairobi-based Founder and Managing Partner at TLcom, Maurizio Caio, said:  ”It is time for Africa Venture Capital (VC) to graduate into a world-class asset class that can generate massive returns. We are excited to bring on board new strategic institutional investors, such as CDC, IFC, Sango Capital and BIO into the fund that share this view. “Attracting international investment from such renowned backers into the African VC space reflects the recognition of the work the TLcom team has already achieved in connecting some of the continent’s strongest entrepreneurs with the capital they need to scale.” Launched in 1999, the over 20-year-old VC firm currently has in excess of $200 million under management across primary and secondary funds.
