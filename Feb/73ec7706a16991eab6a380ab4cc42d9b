Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu of the Federal High Court in Abuja on Wednesday urged the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to put its house in order to tender evidence in the trial of for Jigawa State Governor Sule Lamido. The EFCC charged Lamido with 43 counts amended charge bordering on abuse of office and money laundering to the tune of N1.35 billion. Lamido was arraigned alongside two of his sons – Aminu and Mustapha – as well as Aminu Abubakar, Bamaina Holdings Limited and Speeds International Limited for allegedly defrauding the state. Justice Ojukwu said there was a lot of untidiness between the prosecution and its witness (PW15), Mr Michael Wetkas, in the tendering of bank cheque transactions of the defendants. “You were to spend time with the witness to decide on what you want to do in court in order to have a seamless proceeding,” the judge said. Justice Ojukwu urged the prosecution to rehearse with its witness before coming to court. “How do you want the witness to tender the evidences because you are having frictions between your questions and his answers. “Try to bring the defence along to see how he can align with you in probably presenting a schedule. “And if not, it could be just between the prosecution and its witness.”
