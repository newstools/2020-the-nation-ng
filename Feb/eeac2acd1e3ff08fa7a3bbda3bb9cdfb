A Public Health expert, Dr Juliana Nathaniel has urged government to Integrate child eye health into the Primary healthcare for easy access for those at grassroots. Speaking at the Final Closeout and Dissemination Event for Cluster 1 of the Seeing is Believing (SiB), Programme on Comprehensive Child Eye Health in Nigeria (CCEHiN), at Eleta Eye Institute in Ibadan, Nathaniel said integrating child eye health into PHC is a noble course that should be pursued by all stakeholders. Nathaniel who is the Seeing is Believing (SiB), Programme Director said use of simple technology can help to reduce the magnitude of blindness among children in Nigeria. She noted that SiB is a flagship of the Standard Chartered Bank’s community investment programme which was implemented in three years between February 2017- January 2020 and that the programme was successful. According to her, the cluster 1 which covered Osun, Oyo and Ogun states was carried out in collaboration with the Ministries of Health and Education as well as the State Primary Healthcare Development Agency (SPHCDA) and the State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) in the three states. She added that aim of the SiB programme contributed significantly to the reduction of avoidable blindness and    visual impairments among children in the three states She said SiB provided comprehensive child eye health services to about 1.5 million children aged 0-14 years. Nathaniel lauded the programme’s implementing partners including the Eleta Eye Institute (EEI) and the Community Advancement Initiative for Self Reliance (CAI4SR) for their efforts. She also expressed gratitude to University College Hospital (UCH) Ibadan and other health facilities that supported the programme and ensured actualization of its objective.
