 GOVERNOR Aminu Bello Masari of Katsina State on Saturday in Katsina said “the state has indigenous Christians who also have rights of enjoying every privilege due to a citizen of the state.” Masari, who made the clarification when a delegation of Christian faithful visited him at the Government House said the indigenous Christians in Katsina have no other home than the state and so should rise up and seek for their rights and entitlements, decrying their in-active participation in political activities of the state as prominent ones amongst them often went into hiding from public glare He said “In Katsina, we have indigenous Katsina State Christians that have a right like everybody. I urge you to commit yourselves to the development and progress of the state knowing that you have no home like Katsina State. “We, as government, will continue to ensure you enjoy every privilege in the state.” Masari further urged them to pray for the state and nation, especially on the insecurity be-devilling the nation, which according to him was caused as a result of the neglect of certain category of people in the state by past governments, noting that already, the present administration in the state is making efforts on how to unite every citizen of the state into one main society to prevent further disaster. Earlier, the  leader of the team, who is also the Special Adviser to the Governor on Christian Affairs, Reverend Ishaya Garba, appreciated the government for sponsoring 33 persons to pilgrimage in Israel, for the donation of Christmas gifts and the order to teach Christian Religious Knowledge as a subject in schools.
