The Mobolaji Johnson Sports Complex, Rowe Park, Yaba came alive during the week as Germany-based former international handball player David Sunday and his fiancee Lea Reese gave sports gear to young players. The event also witnessed novelty matches put together by the Lagos State Handball Veteran Association and the Lagos State Handball Association. David, who explained that he is giving back to the society where he was discovered, said the gesture would enable the kids aim for success in the game. “I wanted to give back to the kids who are in the position I was at their age as I know how hard it is to fight for a better life,” David said. David who also donated balls and other equipment to the Lagos State Handball Association, revealed that playing handball at Rowe Park shaped his life. “I use to walk every day to Rowe Park Sport Center for about two hours and on some days without food just to play handball. I did this because my dream was to become a professional handball player and have a better life. I am happy my dream came true as I got the opportunity to play in Europe. “I got the idea of this charity work so we directly contacted some handball clubs in Germany and told them our plans. We were really surprised how many people gave us equipment and they would love to give more in the future. He also thanked the President of the Handball Federation of Nigeria (HFN) Sam Ocheho for the great work he is doing to improve the game in the country. Chairperson of the Lagos State Handball Association, Adeola Opeifa, who received the equipment on behalf of the (LAHA) and Olaniyi Oladapo, the president of the Lagos State Handball Veterans, were excited about the gesture and urge other stakeholders to support handball in the state and Nigeria.
