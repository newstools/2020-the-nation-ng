Our Reporter  The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission yesterday re-arraigned two former Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) officials on amended N163.9 million charge bordering on conspiracy and bribery. NAN reports that the EFCC, on March, 8, 2018, arraigned Dr Godwin Kwanga, a former INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in Plateau State and Jonathan Azi-Nyako, a retired INEC worker. The two were charged, alongside the late Usman Baba-Bukar, a former INEC Administrative Secretary in the state, in the suit filed at a State High Court, with bribery of INEC workers. The anti-graft agency alleged that they bribed INEC workers in the 17 local government areas (LGAs) of the state during the 2015 general elections. They were alleged to have used their positions and conspired among themselves to bribe INEC workers to influence the outcome of the elections in favour of one of the political parties.  News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the death of Baba-Bukar forced the anti-graft agency to amend the charges against the duo. They pleaded not guilty to the new charge. Earlier, EFCC lawyer A. M. Ocholi said: “Since the accused persons have entered their pleas of not guilty, I wish to proceed to call a witness, who is in court to testify. “We are ready to continue with the matter today.” But Mr Innocent Daa’gba, counsel to the former REC, told the court that he was not ready on the ground that he was only served with the amended charges in court. Mr A. G. Yirvoms, counsel to Azi-Nyako, did not object to the application. Justice Christy Dabup adjourned the matter till May 13 and May 14 for continuation of hearing. Kwanga and Azi-Nyako were allowed to enjoy the administrative bail the court granted them.
