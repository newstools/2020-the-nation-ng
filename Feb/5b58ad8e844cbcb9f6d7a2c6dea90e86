He said: “WIth the automated downstream system in place, the DPR no longer accepts manual processing of downstream applications as all Applications for license and permits have been migrated to digital platforms.  “Applicants are, therefore, expected to visit the Electronic license and Permit System (ELPS) portal on our website (www.dpr.gov.ng) and take the following steps: Create your company account by completing your corporate profile; Apply for license or Permit Required; Pay application fee online or through bank branches nationwide; Upload required documents in PDF or TIFF file format; Review and submit application for processing; and DPR issuance of Licence or Permit. “The department has also introduced the Smart Inspector solution to ease technical inspection, real-time data gathering and monitoring of oil and gas facilities to ensure safety and regulatory compliance. “These digitilisation initiatives of the DPR are integrated into the Corporate Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) application system which is the platform for our business system automation. “DPR will continue to provide robust regulatory oversight for the oil and gas industry in Nigeria in furtherance of its vision to be a leading Regulator in the global oil and gas space.”
