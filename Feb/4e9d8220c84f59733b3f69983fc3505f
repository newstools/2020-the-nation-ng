Our Reporter  Odion Ighalo has vowed to dedicate every Manchester United goal he scores during his loan spell to his sister, who tragically passed away in December. The Nigeria international moved to Old Trafford from Shanghai Shenhua on a short-term deal until the end of the season to ease the injury burden at the club. But, despite securing his ‘dream’ move to the club he supported as a boy, Ighalo is still reeling from the tragic loss of his sister, Mary, who died two months ago. The 30-year-old has her name etched on his boots and will wear a white t-shirt underneath his United top with her name written when the club visit Stamford Bridge on Monday night to take on Chelsea.  He spoke to The Sun about his pain, saying: “I feel very emotional because it has not really struck me that my sister is gone forever and I am never going to see her again. “Sometimes when I am alone and I just remember her, I have one sharp pain in my heart. “My twin sister, Akhere, will call me, crying, saying she misses her and, sometimes when I am alone, I cry too. “It is a very painful loss but I am trying to be strong as a man.” Mary Atole collapsed in her home in Canada on the morning of December 12 whilst getting her children ready for school. She was just 43 when she died.
