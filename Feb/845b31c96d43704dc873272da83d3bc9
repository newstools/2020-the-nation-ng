 The Redeemer’s University, Ede, has conducted its matriculation of students for the 2019/2020 academic session, matriculating a total of 788 students. The event, which was held on January 22 marked the 15th  ceremony of the institution. Speaking at the event, the Vice-Chancellor Prof. Anthoy E. Akinlo, mentioned that the number comprised of 748 UTME, direct entry and transfer students, while the remaining 40 were postgraduate students. He said that the fresh students were being conferred full membership of the university because they had fulfilled all necessary admission requirements. He enjoined the students to be of good behaviour within the university while being good ambassadors outside the institution. He urged them to acquaint themselves with the Students’ Handbook of Information and avoid involvement in acts of misconduct, such as stealing, drug abuse, cultism, fighting, examination malpractice and other vices. Prof. Akinlo enjoined parents and guardians not to abandon the task of training their wards to the university alone. In his words, “we urge our parents to join hands with us in ensuring that these young ones have an all-round training so that they will be found worthy both in character and learning in order for them to excel in all ramifications”.
