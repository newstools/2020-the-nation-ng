Barring any last minute delay, the Federal Government has assured the public that the outbound Lagos end of the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, closed down for repair works would be opened this weekend. The Lagos State Director of Works in the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing, Engr Fred Kuti,  said the government is working round the clock to ensure that the roads are opened on schedule. “When we wanted to begin that project in January, we told the world that we would open the road for public use by February 29, and I can confirm that we are working round the clock to ensure that we fulfill our pledge to open the Kara Bridge section by this weekend,” Kuti said. He praised Nigerians for their understanding throughout the period of the closure of the expressway, adding that it is in acknowledgment of their pains that the government impressed it on the contractor to ensure that the delivery timeline of that section was strictly adhered to.
