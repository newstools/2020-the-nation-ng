 The Kogi State High Court sitting in Lokoja has ruled that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had no candidate in the November 16, 2019 governorship election. Justice John Olorunfemi of the High Court 4 said the party’s primary, conducted on September 3, 2019, and won by Musa Wada, was fraught with irregularities. The ruling was in a pre-election matter filed by Abubakar Idris, son of former Governor Ibrahim Idris, which challenged Wada’s candidature. Wada is younger brother of former Governor Idris Wada. Justice Olorunfemi said: “Neither the claimant, Abubakar Idris, nor the defendant, Musa Wada, can lay claim to be the authentic candidate of the PDP since the primary was inconclusive.” The judge noted that Idris, who averred that he would have won the primary if the missing votes which belonged to him were added to his votes, could not convince the court to deliver judgment in his favour. He added that the Wada could also not convince the court that he won the primary which was marred with rancour and acrimony, arising from pandemonium, due to sporadic gunshots which compelled the participants to scamper for safety. The PDP has called for calm following Justice Olorunfemi’s verdict. A statement by the Publicity Secretary, Bode Ogunmola, said the judgment would be tested at a higher court. He added that the party’s legal department is already studying the judgment. Ogunmola assured the people that necessary legal steps will be taken to ensure the wishes of the people are respected. “We promise that the ruling will not deter the party from going ahead with its case. We urge party faithful to keep hope alive. In the long run, justice will be done,” the statement said.
