 Ex-Lagos State Governor Akinwunmi Ambode has appealed the ruling of a Lagos High Court, which struck out a suit seeking to stop the House of Assembly from probing his procurement of 820 buses meant to revolutionise public transportation. The lawmakers suspended the probe after Ambode secured a court order, which directed parties to the suit to maintain status quo. However, in a ruling to the interlocutory action filed by the governor yesterday, Justice Yetunde Adesanya, who presided over the matter, struck out the suit by the former governor on the grounds that it was premature and not justiceable. But in the notice of appeal filed by his counsel, Mr. Tayo Oyetibo, SAN, before the Lagos division of the appeal court, Ambode prayed the court to set aside the decision of the trial court and allow the appeal. Besides, the former governor prayed the appellate court to remit the matter back to the high court to allow the chief judge reassign it to another judge of the high court for trial. Respondents in the appeal are the House of Assembly, its Speaker Mr.Â  Mudashiru Obasa and the House Clerk, Mr. A. A. Sanni. Others are Mr. Fatai Mojeed, the chairman of the Ad-hoc Committee set up by the House to probe the procurement of the buses and eight members of the committee. In one of the four grounds of appeal, Ambode argued that the trial court erred in law when it held that the suit he filed was not mature.
