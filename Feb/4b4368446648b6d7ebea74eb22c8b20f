The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has launched a massive probe into alleged looting of over N150 billion by the immediate past governor of Abia State, Chief Theodore Orji, and members of his family. His sons – Chinendum Orji Eyinanya (currently Speaker, Abia State House of Assembly) and one Ogonna Orji – are also being investigated for having a hand in the alleged looting. Orji is currently the senator representing Abia Central in the National Assembly. The EFCC suspects that Senator Orji collected N48billion as security votes during his eight years in office at N500million per month. He is said to have also been the authorising officer for the monthly withdrawal of N500million when he was the Chief of Staff to the jailed ex-Governor Orji Uzor Kalu. Investigators handling the probe rate Chinedum as a key player in laundering money for his father. As at Thursday, the EFCC had traced 100 slush accounts to Chinedum. Eighty per cent of the accounts are still active, The Nation gathered. Chinedum went through a fresh round of grilling on Thursday before he was released on administrative bail. However, a source told The Nation in Abuja that what has been uncovered so far against ex-Governor Orji and his sons, is a “tip of the iceberg” because more accounts linked to the family have just been uncovered. “We are investigating the ex-governor and members of his immediate family, especially his two sons. They are Chinendum Orji Eyinanya (who is the present Speaker of Abia State House of Assembly) and one Ogonna Orji,” a reliable source said. “The former governor has been intermittently coming for interrogation since November 22, 2018. So, for more than 13 months, our detectives have been painstaking in their covert operation including surfing of documents and invitation of some public officers.  But the quizzing of ex-Governor Orji’s two sons has led to the unearthing of dirty deals during his tenure as the governor of Abia State. He is now a serving Senator. “Preliminary investigation revealed that over 145 accounts have been linked with the family and the amount allegedly looted in eight years by the ex-governor was over N150billion. Chinedum alone has been operating 100 out of the 45 accounts with 80 per cent of them still active. “Although we are still profiling more accounts, records confirmed that the ex-governor earned about N48billion in eight years as security votes at N500 million per month. He was also the authorising officer of the N500 million per month as security votes when the convicted ex-Governor Orji Uzor Kalu was the governor. He was Kalu’s Chief of Staff. “The most interesting aspect of the investigation by EFCC is that most of the looted funds were withdrawn in cash and deposited in cash. “Our detectives recorded a breakthrough on this fraud case through Bank Verification Number (BVN) system. So, it is not a case of witch-hunt, it is a matter of facts and figures in all the accounts.” A brief on the preliminary investigation obtained from the EFCC gave an insight into the alleged looting of Abia State as follows: “A petition dated March 17, 2017 was by filed by Fight Corruption: Save Nigeria Group alleging that the former Abia governor, Theodore Orji of receiving and diverting various sums of monies that accrued to Abia State. “Such monies were: *N383 billion revenue from federal accounts *N55 billion Excess Crude Revenue *N2.3 billion Sure-P *N1.8 billion Ecological funds *N10.5 billion loan from First Bank of Nigeria through the Ministry of Chieftaincy and Local Government Affairs. *N4 billion loan from Diamond Bank *N12 billion Paris Club refund *N2 billion Agricultural loan for farmers *N55 billion ASOPADEC “The petitioners alleged that the funds were received by Abia State government and nothing could be shown in commensurate with the received funds. Based on the petition, the EFCC commenced investigations. “In the course of investigation, it was discovered that the former governor who was Chief of Staff to the convicted ex-governor Orji Kalu was the Authorising Officer drawing N500 million monthly purported to be Security Votes which were being converted. “As he became the governor in 2007, he continued to draw the N500 million cash monthly from June 2007 to May 2015. “The N500 million, investigation revealed, is aside of the security funds expended on the Nigeria Police, The Nigerian Army, DSS, Navy anti-Kidnapping Squad, Anti- robbery Squad, purchase of Security equipment and vehicles for the security agencies. “Investigation was extended to his family members to ascertain the link and culpability of the alleged fraud. “The ex-governor’s first son, Chinendum Orji Eyinanya, who is currently the Speaker of the Abia State House of Assembly, is now a frequent guest at the EFCC headquarters to throw light on his involvement in the fraud. “A check on his financial activities revealed that he had about 100 accounts in different banks, with over 80% of the accounts still very active.
