According to him, “I am deeply saddened by the news of the passing of our indefatigable war veteran, Col. Paul Osa Ogbebor. He remains an inspiration to Edo sons and daughters on account of his candor, perseverance and commitment to noble ideals. “We have lost in him a loyal soldier who was ready to go all out to defend whatever cause he believed. He remains, even in death, a role model to many and a shining light to our people.” Obaseki said Edo people will miss the rare wisdom and insight offered by late Ogbebor on national issues, adding that he died at a time his guidance was dearly needed to navigate the peculiar socio-economic and political challenges facing the state and the country at large.
