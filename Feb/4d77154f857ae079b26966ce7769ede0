 The Federal Government has said the Automotive Training Centre being constructed by the Edo State Government in partnership with the National Automotive Design and Development Council (NADDC), will boost the state government’s job creation drive. The Senior Industrial Officer, NADDC, Eng. Philip Ianna, said this while addressing journalists after inspecting ongoing construction of the Automotive Training Centre in Benin City, the Edo State capital. He lauded Governor Obaseki for collaborating with the NADDC to provide a centre for training youths and boosting job creation, noting, “We are convinced that this training centre is going to be impactful.” The Edo State Focal Person, Social Investment Programme, Aladeselu Osayuwamen, said the state government is collaborating with the NADDC to provide an opportunity for youths to acquire skills in automotive repair and maintenance. “We are here to see the level of readiness of the centre so that we can ascertain when to kick off operations. We are eager to kick-off training at the centre because Governor Godwin Obaseki has a strong desire to equip youths with skills to lead better lives,” she said. Aladeselu added, “We have been looking forward to having something like this and it gives us great joy to partner with NADDC. We are assessing every section to see how comfortable it will be for the trainees. This is because it will be a unisex training Center. We know automobile maintenance is male-dominated, but this centre will accommodate both sexes.” On completion of construction work, the Automotive Training Centre will boast of top-of-the-range facilities, including parking space, training room, mechanical workshop, compressor room, tools storeroom and general workshop, among others.
