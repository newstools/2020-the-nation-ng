 The reshuffling of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) Interim Management Committee (IMC) has been described as proof of President Muhammadu Buhari’s commitment to developing the oil-rich region. A Niger Delta activist, Mr. George Tamuno, disclosed this Wednesday, in a statement made available to newsmen in Warri. The statement while commending the appointment of Professor Kemebradikumo Pondei as the new Acting Managing Director of the IMC, emphasized that the forensic audit ordered by the president will be actualized by the new team headed by Pondei. Tamuno, while appreciating the President for the appointment, charged Niger Deltans to support the new NDDC Acting MD. He further noted that President Buhari and Senator Godswill Akpabio, Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, have continued to put the development of the region into consideration. “His Excellency, Muhammadu Buhari has again proven to the people of Niger Delta that he is committed to the development of the oil rich region, by appointing Professor Kemebradikumo Daniel Pondei as the new Acting Managing Director of Niger Delta Development Commission NDDC. Because the forensic audit is very important to Mr. President and Senator Godswill Akpabio, Minister of Niger Delta Affairs. “The appointment of Professor Pondei as the new Acting Managing Director of Interim Management Committee of the Niger Delta Development Commission was timely to boost the confidence of Niger Deltans and also to actualise the President’s ordered forensic audit of the NDDC”.
