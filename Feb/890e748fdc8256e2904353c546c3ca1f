You are bound to call for more conversations on idioms as long as you continue to encounter incorrect expressions like these: save for the raining day; in leap and bound; fanning the embers of; pay leap service to and so on. All of these are unacceptable corruptions of certain English standard expressions or idioms from which they have been adapted. In today’s last edition on idioms, we will discuss the misused expressions highlighted. Kindly note, however, that there is still so much to know and mind about idioms. So far, we have only scratched the surface while advising writers to master English idioms as the special properties they are and use them correctly all the time. That suggests that when next you deploy any idiom, take time to double-check. Save for a rainy day This is a commonplace piece of advice employed frequently to guide people about their future. Our concern here, however, is that it is often violated, as in the misusage below: It should not have required more than primary common sense for those managing our economy to know the volatility of the oil market and save for a raining day. ‘We save for a rainy day, not raining day. When you “save, keep, etc. something for a rainy day” (as cited in “Pop” Errors), you “save something, especially money, for a time you will really need it,” that is, when circumstances may be less auspicious. The seminal columnist, from whose writing we took this example, aptly reminded his reader of the biblical Joseph who, as prime minister of Egypt in ancient times, provided during the seven years of plenty for the anticipated period of lack. He was in that particular edition rebuking the managers of his country’s economy.” You would do well to note that the crux of the matter concerning the idiom at issue is the element rainy. The bone of contention is: Is it raining or rainy? RAINY is it, not RAINING! We might as well highlight other expressions that tend to confound matters for some writers, namely: runny nose; leaky roof; and bouncy baby, which many habitually and wrongly render respectively as running nose; leaking roof; and bouncing baby. Meanwhile, we correct the faulty usage in the sentence at issue, thus: It should not have required more than primary common sense for those managing our economy to know the volatility of the oil market and save for a RAINY day. By/in leaps and bounds If we may borrow from that famous advert “If it is not Panadol, it is not Panadol,” we admonish, once again, that no matter how infinitesimal your deviation from the standard idiom, the outcome is never the true idiom. Such deviations can portray you as either careless at best or ignorant at worst. That is the feeling about how the idiom by/in leaps and bounds has been garbled in the following statement: In the last two decades, China’s influence and engagement jn Africa’s economic renaissance have grown in leap and bound. The full idiom in reference here is by/in leaps and bounds. It means “very quickly; in large amounts” (as cited in “Pop” Errors). The book reminds us “that idioms do not admit much tinkering; even if it is just a letter you have dropped, it is no longer the same thing.” And it points out that: “In this example, if you mouth grown in leap and bound, you will see that it lacks euphony, unlike grown in leaps and bounds, the idiom in its correct form.” So, the correct way to use the idiom is: In the last two decades, China’s influence and engagement jn Africa’s economic renaissance have grown in LEAPS and BOUNDS. Fanning the flames of something This idiom is particularly worth highlighting because it is most notoriously breached, to the point that it now looks permanently altered, with its key element erroneously changed from flames to embers. The etymology of this unhelpful metamorphosis must be some supposedly infallible exemplars whose word was law to their protégés, who in turn have ensured that the error gained almost irreversible traction. Such a received habit is the problem in the following faulty specimen: His position is that we should keep the party intact instead of fanning the embers of discord. Here is our writers’ companion’s comment: ‘Fanning the flames (NOT embers) of discord is what is being discouraged in this political homily. The way idioms get twisted, and the corrupted versions gain ascendancy to totally suppress the original in many instances, is an ever-present threat to the orthodoxy and integrity of languages. We are all witnesses to the mutilation of idioms like more power to somebody’s elbow, which is now rampantly called more grease to somebody’s elbow. The idiom here in consideration may have suffered such damage with impunity over time. To avoid joining the multitude to do evil to language, let us note that the original idiom is fanning the flames of something, meaning “to make a feeling such as anger, hatred, etc. worse.” Etymologically, it is “based on the literal meaning of fan the flames.”’ Pay lip service Take a sharp look at the comical muddling of this simple idiom in the sentence below: While this is currently being done by most African states, it appears that most of them pay leap services to it until there is an outbreak of crises. It suffices to simply stress here that what people do is pay lip service to something, NOT pay leap services. This is when they act by word of mouth only.
