A High Court in Plateau State on Monday ordered that former police sergeant, James Moses, 33, who allegedly shot his friend to death, be remanded in correctional centre. The judge, Nafisa Musa, gave the order following a prayer by prosecution counsel, S. O. Emmanuel, to remand Moses as the offence he allegedly committed made him ineligible for bail. The defendant pleaded not guilty to the charge. The judge adjourned the matter until March 26, for hearing. Prosecution counsel earlier told the court that on July 26, 2019, the defendant, at Tudun Wada, Jos North, shot his friend with his service rifle, which led to his death. Emmanuel said that the offence contravened section 312 of the Penal Code, punishable with death upon conviction. The defendant, however, in his statement to the police, claimed that he shot his friend by mistake during a hug. “I didn’t mean to kill him. I was at a beer joint when he came to meet me, I had my rifle hung around my neck and the bullet discharged. “I forgot completely about it and unaware that it was not on safety hold. My hand mistakenly touched the trigger when my friend came to hug me and it went off, killing him in the process; it was not intentional,” Moses said.
