 THE Kaduna State government said it has arrested a suspected fake medical doctor, Saidu Ahmed Ya’u, who has been in the employ of the state for 11 years. The state Ministry of Justice has charged Ya’u before the Chief Magistrate court for certificate forgery and impersonation. A statement issued by the Ministry of Justice signed by the Attorney General of Kaduna State, Aisha Dikko, said that the accused has been remanded at the Kaduna Correctional Facility until March 16. The statement further said that the First Information Report (FIR) indicated that Ya’u has been working as a medical doctor for more than 11 years in the Ministry of Health. According to the Attorney-General, Governor Nasir El Rufai ordered the Ministry of Health to investigate Saidu, following a petition alleging that he has been working with fake certificates. The Ministry of Health set up a  four-member committee to investigate and  verify the certificates and institutions that Saidu claimed to have attended as well as verify his registration with the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria(MDCN). The statement stated that the committee found out that the accused forged the certificates, which he presented to the government to  enable him secure employment with Kaduna State Ministry of Health. “Information gathered from Ahmadu Bello University(ABU) Zaria and MDCN also reveals that Saidu was neither admitted nor graduated from the university and was not registered with the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria,” the statement added. The Attorney General said that when the charges were read to the defendant, he said they were false but the Director of Public Prosecution opposed his bail application.
