CIRO Immobile became the first player in 61 years to reach 27 Serie A goals after 25 matches as Lazio moved back within one point of leaders Juventus. The Italy striker, 30, doubled Lazio’s lead after Adam Marusic’s opener at relegation-threatened Genoa. Francesco Cassata replied but Danilo Cataldi made it 3-1 before Domenico Criscito scored a late penalty. Antonio Angelillo was the last man to make such a prolific start to a Serie A season, with Inter Milan in 1958-59. The Argentine striker ended that season with 33 goals in 33 games. But the record for most goals in a Serie A campaign is held by current Juve striker Gonzalo Higuain, who scored 36 in 35 games for Napoli in 2015-16. Higuain set the record in style. Going into the final game of the season, he was two goals behind Gunnar Nordahl’s mark of 35 in 37 for AC Milan, which had stood since 1949-50.
