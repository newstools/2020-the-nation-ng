Commenting on the development, Mr Ambrose Omordion, Chief Operating Officer, InvestData Ltd., said the Coronavirus news heightened the negative sentiment already in the market. Omordion stated that the news further affected the performances of the domestic equities which had been battling with liquidity issue. “The news of coronavirus entering the country has further dampened investors confidence in the stock market as reflected in the global markets that are bleeding badly as a result of selloffs. “There is already fear of global recession due to the virus,” he said. He noted that market players expected government at all levels to be proactive in tackling the virus to avoid further spread to other parts of the country. Omordion said the issue should be contained the way the previous administration fought Ebola, as the World Health Organisation (WHO) and others continued to look for solutions to put an end to the virus. But, we at InvestData anticipated that recovering was underway because it is a global problem. “The market and economy of China where it started is already recovering as over 35,000 people have been discharged from the hospital. “And Chinese government has intensified efforts to check the virus and they have injected funds to the economy to stimulate economic productivity,” Omordion said.
