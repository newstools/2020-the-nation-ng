By Precious Igbonwelundu Minister of Works and Housing Babatunde Fashola (SAN) on Monday described the ban on commercial motorcycles in some areas of Lagos as commendable. He urged residents to support the government. Fashola spoke at a public lecture on ‘Security as a social contract’, organised by the United Action for Change (UAC), at the Digital Bridge Institute, Lagos. Using a bank robbery in Ikorodu when he was Lagos State governor as an example, Fashola noted that motorcycles were choice means of transportation for criminals who capitalised on its manoeuvrability to escape arrest.
