An international businessman, Chief Solomon Nwadiogbu, has asked the Federal High Court in Lagos to reassign his case against the management of Eko Hotel and Suites from Justice S. Saidu, over alleged bias and lack of confidence. Nwadiogbu told reporters in Lagos at the weekend that the suit he filed against the hotel over the illegal seizure of his personal belongings valued at about N400 million is about to be frustrated after almost a year of being assigned the case. The businessman is locked in a legal battle with the hotel over the seizure of his personal belongings worth almost N400 million. Contacted, the hotel’s Company Secretary, Samuel Alabi, said Nwadiogbu was ejected from the hotel for beating a security guard. According to him: “He was ejected from our hotel for beating a security guard. He claimed the security guard allowed someone to park a car in-between his cars. “We have the CCTV recording of the incident. We had to eject him and in the process discovered that he owes the hotel. “We have even asked him to come and pick his cars since the matter is in court because we can recover them if we secure a conviction in court. We have no business with the pace of the case.”
