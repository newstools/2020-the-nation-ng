A Pall of uncertainty is still surrounding the decision of the Federal Government to regulate the social media in the country. Even those in government are unsure of the model to adopt. But the regulation shelf is filled up with many options: Egypt, China, Singapore, South Korea, The European Union, Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States. A top source in government said: “We have not decided on the model to adopt. Some wanted wholesale adoption of what is obtainable in a country; others have recommended a hybrid policy. But we cannot do without social media regulation.” The Minister of Information and Culture, AL. Lai Mohammed, however, said the government was pushing ahead with the regulation of social media. He said: “We are also pushing ahead with our plan to sanitize the social media, working with stakeholders. By March 2nd 2020, we will inaugurate the stakeholders committee that will deliberate and recommend the way forward. “We are also planning a major international conference that will bring together the tech companies, media practitioners, policy makers and others as part of efforts to tackle this growing canker-worm “Last week, I met with representatives of Google and Facebook for the same purpose. The situation is dire, and no nation that values its peace, security and stability will allow an irresponsible use of the social media.”
