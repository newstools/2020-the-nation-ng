 Qruna Quadri stopped what could have been his nemesis at the 2020 ITTF Africa Top 16 Cup after coming from behind to beat Egypt’s Omar Assar 4-3 in the semifinal of the men’s singles. From the start of the encounter, the Egyptian who is the tournament’s defending champion was dominating with the first two games at 11-6, 11-5, but the Nigerian who is seeded number one fought back to level up at 11-4, 14-12. The match has all the element of top class tie and the fans at the Rades Multi-Purpose Hall were treated to an exciting match with both players displaying exceptional skills to the admiration of the spectators. Again, the Egyptian raced to a lead after winning the fifth game at 11-7. Like what he did earlier, Quadri worked his way back into the match with 11-5 win to put the match at 3-3. In the deciding game, it was as if that Egyptian was going to win easily but Quadri worked his up to level up at 7-7. But the tide was going in favour of the Egyptian with the game at 10-8 as Assar needed only one point to end the tie, but Quadri again proved his never-say-die spirit to level up and took the game at 12-10 to the excitement of the Tunisian fans. Quadri won 4-3 overall to maintain his status as the number one seed of the competition. Quadri will wait for the winner of the tie between Egypt’s Ahmed Saleh and Senegal’s Ibrahima Diaw. In a related development, Offiong Edem was at her best against Egypt’s Yousra Helmy in the women’s singles semifinal of the 2020 ITTF Africa Top 16 Cup as the Nigerian recovered from 2-0 to beat her opponent 4-2. Edem who managed to finish third in 2018 will now face defending champion, Egypt’s Dina Meshref in the final. Earlier in the day, Meshref had defeated Cameroun’s Sarah Hanffou 4-2 to hit the final for the fourth consecutive editions of the tournament.
