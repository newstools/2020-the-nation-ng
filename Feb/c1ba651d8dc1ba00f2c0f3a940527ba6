 FOLLOWING the out-break of the coronavirus in China early this year, the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) has indicated its members’ readiness to look elsewhere for raw materials, machinery and equipment. Its Presiden, Mansur Ahmed, acknowledged that China is a cheap source for most of these inputs, but maintained that the safety of lives of Nigerians are of greatest importance, as such most manufacturers can always get alternatives to keep their factories running. “Obviously, our members have had to deal with the issue in the best way they can. They have started looking elsewhere for importation of raw materials, equipment and machinery. “For many of these items, they do have alternatives, maybe the Chinese products would be a little cheaper, but they can always get an alternative if they need to,” he said. Ahmed spoke at a press conference in Lagos, during the week, to herald this year’s edition of the Nigeria Manufacturing and Equipment/Nigerian Raw Materials Expo (NME/NIRAM Expo), scheduled to hold from  March 10-12. He said the coronavirus has already affected oil prices because the Chinese economy has gone into a slow down due to the virus and the demand for oil has gone down and it has impacted the international oil prices. Ahmed, however, said: “We have been engaging government on this and the first thing is to ensure that the virus does not get into our shores and we hope that the health authorities at all levels are doing everything possible to protect the nation. “I believe it will be done because we were very successful during the Ebola outbreak. If we bring the same level of commitment and effort, we will be able to protect ourselves from this deadly virus.”
