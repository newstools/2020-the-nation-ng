 Benue State governor, Samuel Ortom, has warned perpetrators of the crisis in Tyo-Mu community of Makurdi local government area to cease hostilities and give peace a chance. The governor described as unacceptable the violence, which has led to the burning of many houses and displacement of hundreds of people. He stated that no individual or group has the right to claim ownership of land, as all lands belong to government. Ortom urged security operatives to identify and arrest any individual or group of persons suspected to be fuelling the crisis, stressing that his administration will not allow enemies of peace to get away with their anti-development actions. He wondered why the people of Tyo-Mu who have lived together for decades have suddenly allowed selfish individuals to plant seeds of discord among them, charging them to embrace dialogue initiated by the state security council.
