 NIGERIAN Ports Authority (NPA) has empowered over 500 indigent persons in Umuoziri community, Ikeduru Local Government of Imo State. At an event  under its Corporate Social Initiative (CSI), on St. Peter’s Anglican Church premises, NPA gave beneficiaries sewing machines, motorcycles and oil processing equipment. Managing Director Adiza Bala Usman, who presented the items, explained that NPA, in line with President Muhammadu Buhari’s policy on empowerment of the indigent, visited the community to see ways to alleviate their suffering. Usman who spoke through NPA’s principal Manager Corporate/Strategic Communication Ikechukwu Onyemegara said the policy of NPA was to empower the less privileged. She believed that if youth and the indigent were empowered and kept busy on one trade or the other, crimes and other vices would be reduced. She said the empowerment was a national programme, and urged beneficiaries to make judicious use of items donated to them. In his welcome address, President General of the community, Richard Ihejirika thanked NPA for the gesture to his people. “The gifts is like God has visited the community in the likeness of men to liberate the people …from poverty and destitution,” he said.
