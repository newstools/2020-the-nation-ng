 POLICE in Sokoto State said they were in pursuit of an armed robbery gang that robbed a retired Navy captain Abubakar El-Yakubu of N5 million. Police spokesman ASP Muhammad Sadiq said yesterday that the retired captain withdrew the money from a bank and kept it in the trunk of his Peugeot 406 car. Yakubu, who is now a school contractor and newspaper distributor, is said to have proceeded with the money to the Sahara area of Sokoto to drop off unsold copies of newspapers and collect new supplies when his assailants trailing him in a yellow Toyota Corolla car closed in, took the money and fled. The police said, “While he was in the office of his business partner to sort out things, the hoodlums shot at his driver in his left leg and carted away the money. “The injured driver was rushed to hospital.” The police said they were after the hoodlums.
