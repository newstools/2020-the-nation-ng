A stakeholders’ forum, The 16 Niger Delta Groups, have appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to dissolve the Joy Nuinieh-led interim management committee of Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). A statement signed by National Coordinator of Persons not Party Pureh Kalango; President of Ijaw Professionals and Entrepreneurs Association (IPYED) Abiye Achepaka, among others, said the law governing NDDC had no provision for interim committee. The statement reads: “As a coalition, we believe that the continuous stay of the illegal interim management committee will deepen the animosity among member-states because some states have been marginalised and deprived of their legitimate right to occupy certain positions based on the zoning formula enshrined in NDDC Act. “The Minister of Niger Delta, Godswill Akpabio, is aware of the crisis the foisting of this illegal committee on NDDC could cause. We also know that the publicised forensic audit will only be a success when an independent body carries out this task, not a committee made up of politicians with personal and partisan interest. “We call on major stakeholders to intervene in the crisis in NDDC. We are ready to hold peaceful protests to beg Mr President to end this injustice.”
