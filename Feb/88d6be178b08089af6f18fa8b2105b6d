  THE National Union of Road Transport Workers  (NURTW),  Lagos State chapter, on Thursday held a rally on Lagos Island. The rally, The Nation learnt, was meant to further unite the feuding parties after the peace meetings held at the NURTW Agege headquarters. NURTW Lagos State Council Chairman Alhaji Musiliu Akinsanya aka MC Oluomo dissolved the Lagos Island Branch ‘C’ of the union following incessant fighting in the area that led to the death of some people. Akinsanya said the dissolution became necessary having tried unsuccessfully to pacify the leadership of the branch to unite. The peace rally was led by NURTW Lagos State Council Treasurer Alhaji Mustapha Adekunle aka Sego. It started from Campos to Idumota, Ebute Ero, Apogbon, Lafiaji, Okepopo and ended at Onala. Adekunle said the essence of the rally was to appeal to Lagos Island residents to shun violence. He said NURTW members on Lagos Island are not violent, adding that the leadership at the state council will not condone violence. “We have our internal ways of resolving crisis. There are rules and regulations we follow as union members. Anyone found committing crimes will be expelled from the union and handed over to the police for prosecution,” Adekunle said. The NURTW state treasurer warned members of the union on Lagos Island not to harbour any criminal in their garage. “We need to let the public know that crimes perpetrated on Lagos Island have nothing to do with the union. This is necessary to regain the trust. I appeal to you not to allow people that are not union members to foment trouble in our garages,” he said
