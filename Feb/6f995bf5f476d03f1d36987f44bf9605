Award-Winning actress and movie producer, Eniola Badmus, has called out owners and manufacturers of weight-loss products to use her as a project to test the durability of their products. The 36-year-old actress made the announcement via her Instagram page. “If truly your weight-loss pills and food works use Eniola Badmus as a project…work on me and let the world see the progress stop using people we know as slim people to advertise weight-loss food, pills and etc,” she posted. Her post, however, generated many comments from her fans and colleagues include talented actress Funke Akindele, Juliet Ibrahim, Uche Jombo, Cynthia Shalom, Monalisa Chinda, Seyi Shay among others However, a weight loss and nutrition expert @askdamz responded to the Eniola’s post debunking the use of pills and other products to lose weight. “First, we preach strongly against slimming pills or slimming teas (such things do not work). Weight loss is basically about calories in versus calories out. How much do you eat and how much do you burn? It is simple: eat healthy meals and be physically active too. We teach our team members every time. There’s no shortcut to this lifestyle. @eniola_badmus we will be glad to have you on our team but the most important question is this, how bad do you want it? Weight loss is first about you, not anyone else but you️”, the post read.
