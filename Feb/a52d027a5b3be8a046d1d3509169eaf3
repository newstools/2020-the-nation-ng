The Kebbi State government has urged the public to disregard a purported list of political appointees in the state circulated on the social media. Governor Atiku Bagudu’s media adviser, Yahaya Sarki, in a statement yesterday, said: “The public are informed to disregard such list as it did not originate from the Kebbi State government.” Yahaya also reminded the public to disregard any information and document in the social media on the government’s activities which did not come from the Office of the governor’s Special Adviser on media.
