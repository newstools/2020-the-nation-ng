All is set for tomorrow’s public hearing on the bill for a law to amend the Lagos Neighborhood Safety Corps Law 2019 to establish the Lagos Amotekun Corps. The hearing which is the brainchild of  State House of Assembly is scheduled for the Assembly Pavilion, Assembly Complex, Alausa Secretariat, Ikeja. The important legislative procedure will hold simultaneously in all the six states across the Southwest. The Chairman of the House Committee on Information, Security and Strategy, Tunde Braimoh, urged  critical stakeholders to come to the hearing venue with their contributions and memoranda. The event, according to him, “is put together by the House of Assembly in furtherance of its extant and traditional practice of involving the citizens, especially critical stakeholders, in its legislative activities for robust results. “While personal invitations have been extended to some individuals and organisations considered directly relevant to the state security architecture, this notice also serves as invitation to any member of the public or organizations who might have any contributions to make or memoranda to submit. “Security is a common concern and it begins with each individual.”
