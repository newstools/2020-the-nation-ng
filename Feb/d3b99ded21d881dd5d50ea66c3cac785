Robert Egbe A Federal High Court in Lagos has sentenced a Ghanaian, Paul Gyan, to 35 years imprisonment for drug trafficking. Justice Chuka Austin Obiozor convicted Gyan, 40, of unlawful import of 2.02 kilogrammes of a proscribed substance, Methamphetamine. The judge sentenced him to jail terms of 15 years on counts one and three, and five years on count two, making the total jail terms 35 years. The jail term shall run concurrently, Obiozor said but gave Gyan an option of N250, 000 fines each on counts one and three. The judge also ordered that the convict be deported to Ghana after serving his sentence and that his travel passport be forfeited to the Ghanaian government. The Ghanaian was arraigned before the judge by the National Drugs Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) in 2018. He pleaded not guilty and was admitted to bail. Prosecution counsel Mrs. Juliana Iroabobuchi told Justice Obiozor that Gyan was arrested on February 25, 2018, at the departure hall of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Ikeja during an outward clearance of Ethiopia Airlines passengers. The court heard that the NDLEA discovered the banned substance in tomato tins, packed in Gyan’s ‘Ghana Must Go’ bags. He was said to have conspired with another Ghanaian named John, residing in Ghana and another man also named John, said to be resident in Nigeria. The prosecution called several witnesses and tendered exhibits which included the convict’s international passport, bulk of the banned substance and a report of the forensic analysis.
