 Coach Gernot Rohr has vowed to stick with his tried and trusted lieutenants when the eagerly awaited list for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON)  March’s double-header against Sierra Leone is revealed. The German speaking exclusively with NationSport  has doused on-going speculations  that he was toying with the idea of drafting new lads into the fold. Often criticised for being conservatives in dishing out call-ups to certain category of players sans recourse to home-based stars, Rohr said he was impressed that many Nigerian players are pretty doing well with their respective clubs. “ We have many players playing in highest leagues  and who have lots of talents; and giving us a lot of satisfaction,” the 66-year-old said when pressed about the likelihood of adding some fresh legs to the Super  Eagles for the 2021 AFCON showdown against Sierra Leone. “The actual group is doing very well and it will not be easy to take their positions.” Yet in another breath, Rohr revealed he could hand fresh call-ups to one or two faces for next month’s AFCON qualifiers against Sierra Leone. The German tactician reportedly stated that he is already working on the list which should be out in the first week of March even as he hopes there would be no fresh injury crises in the squad. “They will probably be one or two new players for our next list because it is the moment to see other new options but we have to wait a little bit to know how many players we can invite because of the injury,” Rohr was quoted as saying in an interview with AOIFootball.com. ”The list will be done beginning of March like usually three weeks before our game so I hope we will not have any fresh injury worries,” Rohr added. The Eagles’ gaffer, according to the website,  could hand debut call-ups to on-form Dutch-based forward Cyriel Dessers who has scored 13 goals in the Eredivisie this season as he hopes to add more firepower to the Eagles frontline.
