 WITH 24 hours to the flag-off of the maiden edition of the MASVI/Owan West Cycling race holding across towns of the local government, the indigenes are wearing expectant looks in anticipation of the one-day race. As the organisers of the race led by the Chairman of the National Cycling Commissaires Association of Nigeria, Osaretin Emuze marked the routes for the race yesterday, the people trooped out, looking with grins and asked probing questions about the race. Most of them said they were looking out to welcoming not only the over 60 cyclists and officials expected on the tour but to welcome the Edo State Deputy Governor, Comrade Philip Shaibu who is expected to flag off the race. “We are excited to witness a cycling race in our community and welcome our Deputy Governor who is coming to flag it off”, Michael Ilevbare, a cycling enthusiast told our reporter. Meanwhile, Owan West Chairman, Frank Ilaboya who is the chief host has assured that every logistic needed to make the competition a success has been put in place. “I can assure you that we have done our homework and put in place every logistic to ensure we have a successful race,” Ilaboya said.
