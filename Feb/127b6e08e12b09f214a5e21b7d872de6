 THE Chairman of Lagos State Butchers Association Badagry Zone, Mr Taiwo Olanase has petitioned the Assistant Inspector-General of Police (AIG) Zone II over an alleged threat to his life. The petition signed by his lawyer D. J. Fadesere of D.J Fadesere & Co said some members of the association were after Olanase’s life. Fadesere said Olanase was attacked at Ibiye slaughter slab in Badagry Town around 4:15pm. “They tried to slaughter our client but he barely escaped by sheer luck,” he said According to the lawyer, Olanase was duly recognised and certified by the Lagos State Ministry of Wealth Creation and Employment to run the slab. “After the attack, our client reported the matter to the Area K Police Command Badagry and in the presence of the Investigation Police officer one of the attackers said that he will waste our client. “Our client is daily facing a constant threat and the inability of the men and officers of Area K Police Command to rise up to the occasion has emboldened his attackers. “As things are, we want you to use your good offices to wade into this matter as our assurance of a speedy response is based upon our esteemed regard for your good self and other members of your command, all of whom are famed for uprightness,” he said. Narrating how the incident occurred, Olanase said he was at the slab when some group of fellow butchers stormed the place and started attacking him and others.
