The Nigeria Army has confirmed an attempt by Boko Haram insurgents to infiltrate Damaturu, capital of Yobe State and cause havoc in the city. The Acting Assistant Director, Army Public Relations, Sector 2 Operation Lafiya Dole, Damaturu, Lt. Chinonso Polycarp Oteh told our correspondent that the insurgents came through Babangida, the headquarters of Tarmuwa Local Government along the Gashua road but were overpowered by superior fire of ground troops and Airforce support. Lt. Oteh explained:  “The swift arrival of the Airforce fighter jet foiled the plans of the bad boys and they could not also withstand the superior ground fire power of our men”. He called on residents of Damaturu to be calm as according to him, “there is no cause for alarm. “Everything is under control and the general area is free from threat. People are advised to go about their usual business and report any suspicious movement to security agencies”. Unconfirmed reports indicate that the insurgents also launched an attack on Babangida, in Tarmuwa where they burnt telecommunication masts. The situation has grounded all mobile service connections in Babangida at the time of filling this report. A local source from Babangida, who could not give details of the attack on the town,  told our correspondent that most of the residents have deserted the town. “People have run out of the town for safety, I spoke with somebody earlier and he told me most people have ran out of the town. “I am sure this could be true because none of the mobile lines of my brothers in Babangida are going through,” the source explained.
