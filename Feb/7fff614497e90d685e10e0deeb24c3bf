With Victor Akande  BEIRUT-BORN disc jockey, Hassan Zahreddine, has confessed his love for Afrobeats, the genre popularized by Nigerian musicians. A Lebanese by birth, DJ Acejammal, who is also known as DJ Ace, grew up Abidjan, Ivory Coast, with his parents before moving to Beirut at the age of nine, declared himself as the face of Afrobeats in the Middle East. The turntable spin master is currently on residency in one of Dubai’s biggest club known as White Dubai. Asked the biggest African artistes in Lebanon, he said: “In Beirut, the most loved African artistes are Wizkid, Burna Boy, Davido, Vegedream, Booba, Dadju, Maitre Gims and Aya Nakamura. “I’m feeling Burna Boy. I’m trying to get a collaboration with Burna Boy or Wizkid. I’m working on it. Fans should expect a big project between Africa and Middle East. “What’s next in my life is I’m trying to make music for Wizkid or Burna Boy because I love their vibe. I love the Rhythm they sing with.  After launching my night under Starboy’s brand which represents Wizkid in Dubai, I think I need to fit in more with representing the Afrobeats in the Middle East because that’s my passion and that’s what I stand for.” Recalling his most memorable moment, he said: “The most memorable career point of being a DJ was when White Beirut (one of the top nightclubs) reached out to me and asked for my CV. I handed in my set and waited, soon enough they gave me a call back and asked me to come in for a tryout! I was super happy because I knew this opportunity would give me great exposure and open many doors down the line in my career. I was hired in the summer of 2013 and have been with them since. Now I’m also working for White Dubai all winter season long.” Acejammal has hosted global artistes like Major Lazer, Soulja Boy, Tpain, Akon and Tinie Tenpah among others.
