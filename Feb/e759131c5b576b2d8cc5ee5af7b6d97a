Lionel Messi has sensationally ended his four-match run without a goal by scoring a hat-trick against Eibar at the Camp Nou. The 32-year-old Argentine forward was on his longest goal drought in La Liga since the 2013-14 campaign, despite assisting an impressive six times in his last four matches. However, Messi returned to his best in front of goal with a sublime showing for Barcelona in their clash with Eibar. The six-time Ballon d’Or winner ended his goal drought early in the first half with a mesmerising display of pace and skill. Messi received the ball with his back turned to the Eibar backline before turning and charging directly towards the opposition. The Barcelona captain nutmegged one defender before successfully battling another Eibar player and delightfully chipping Marko Dmitrovic. Messi returned later in the first half and once again put the Eibar players under pressure with his blistering pace. The Argentine superstar raced past several defenders before he coolly slotted past Dmitrovic to double Barca’s lead.
