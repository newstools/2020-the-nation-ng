Over 100 golfers from Edo State and golfing friends of late Chief Sam Iredia from across the nation participated in a major memorial tourney in honour of one of Nigeria’s main golf icons at the vast course of the University of Benin Teaching Hospital [UBTH] Golf Club last weekend. Also at the event were three sons of the late former Edo Chief of staff and chairman Edo State Board of Internal Revenue Service who came from US to witness the golfing community honour their father. Speaking at the event, the Captain of the Club, Professor Gabriel Ofevwe, noted that it was important to host such big event in honour of Iredia because until his death he was the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Club. Besides, Ofevwe stated that it was through the extra push from Iredia that made several intellectuals within the University community take to the game of golf. “Through the founder, Professor Eugene Okpere, we just happened to find ourselves on this pretty golf course,” Ofevwe stated. “Many of us know the game but were not really playing. But the late Iredia would come around and lecture us on the gains of the game. “We took his fatherly advice and started playing the game. We are all better for it today. So, honouring his passing with such a big event like this is just our own little way of thanking the real golf icon of our time for his precious support to the development of this great club which remains the only West African University with a golf course, he added.
