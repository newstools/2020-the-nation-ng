New West Brom manager Sam Allardyce is keen on bringing Crystal Palace defender James Tomkins to the Hawthorns next month, according to the Evening Standard. Tomkins previously played under Allardyce when the pair were at West Ham. Allardyce was clearly impressed by what he saw. He now wants Tomkins to help keep the Baggies in the Premier League. Tomkins has yet to feature for Palace this season. He has made the bench in three of their last four games, however. This indicates he may not be completely out of Roy Hodgson’s plans. However the club’s owner, Steve Parish, is aware the average age of Hodgson’s squad needs to be lowered. Last month, Parish said: “The average age doesn’t win or lose you games but obviously there is a time limit on players in terms of physical ability to perform.
