 Bayelsa State Governor, Senator Douye Diri, has graced opening  fixture of the 2020/2021 Nigeria Women Premier League encounter between Bayelsa Queens of Yenagoa and Sunshine Queens of Akure at the Samson Siasia Stadium, Yenagoa. The governor was accompanied by members of his ExCo and other dignitaries in a game that was filled with scintillating displays from both sides. Technical adviser of Bayelsa Queens, Moses Adaku, made few changes from the team that beat Nasarawa Amazons in the final of the just-concluded Flying Officers Cup in Abuja. Bayelsa Queens’ captain, Joy Jerry, gave the host the lead  in 27th minute through Igwe Uzoamaka cross to go pass the visitors’ goalkeeper who had twice saved Anjor Mary’s shot. Precious Vincent doubled the lead in the 34th minute for the Yenagoa-based side, seven minutes later Funkule Seun reduced the deficit for the visitors through goalkeeper Okeke Oyinyechukwu’s blunder.   The victory leaves Bayelsa Queens with three points after match day one of the 2020/2021 Nigeria Women Premier league.
