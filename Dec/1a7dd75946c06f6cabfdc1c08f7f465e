 Human Development Initiatives (HDI), a non-governmental organisation (NGO) that monitors the Universal Basic Education (UBE) projects, took its old and new volunteer monitors through a rigorous training for two days last week to upgrade their skills. The training held at R&A City Hotel, Ikeja, was anchored by Prof. Stephen Oyebade and Dr. Gbenusola Akinwale, both of the University of Lagos (UNILAG). In his presentation on “Monitoring education projects in 21st century Nigeria” on the first day of the training, Oyebade highlighted the various educational policies operating in Nigeria and underscored the need for close monitoring.  “Implementation of education policies needs close monitoring.  If your role will be meaningful, it should be in the area of improving performance, school outcomes,” he said. Oyegbade, who has taught for 42 years, lamented that the fortunes of education and other areas of national life had dwindled in Nigeria since his school days, calling for due diligence from the monitors. Speaking on “Surviving Strategies for coping with frustration and stress as an Education Monitor in a Post-COVID Nigeria” on day two, Akinwale of the Department of Psychology explained the features of frustration and stress and how to overcome them.  She said stress could manifest physically, mentally or behaviourally and be addressed behaviourally or cognitively. She said: “Coping strategies may be behavioral or cognitive. Behavioral coping efforts are overt physical or verbal activities, whereas cognitive efforts involve the conscious manipulation of one’s thoughts or emotions.” In an interview, the Executive Director, HDI, Mrs. Funso Owasanoye said it was necessary for the monitors to upskill to be effective in their roles when they visit schools.
