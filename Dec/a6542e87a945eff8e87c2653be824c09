Ekiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, has declined confirmation of his rumoured ambition to contest the presidential election on the platform of the All Progressive Congress (APC) in 2023. Fayemi’s posters had been spotted in the social media and Ado-Ekiti in recent times but he disassociated himself from them. The posters had a photograph of the governor dressed in a sky blue agbada with a blue striped cap popularly called “Awolowo” was sponsored by the Chairman of Ikere Council area of Ekiti State, Mr Femi Ayodele. Ayodele said he did the posters, with the campaign message, ‘Support His Excellency Dr John Kayode Fayemi for President 2023’ “to show my unalloyed and uncompromising loyalty to Governor Fayemi” to dispel speculations that he was working against him. The council chairman said the governor was fit enough for the plum position considering his array of outstanding credentials, administrative shrewdness and political acumen. He added that Fayemi’s commitment, resourcefulness and pedigree put him in good stead to lead Nigeria in the next political dispensation. However, the governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Yinka Oyebode, who said his principal did not know anything about the posters, said, “the sponsor is merely expressing a personal opinion.” While fielding questions from panelists during a media chat programme tagged, ‘meet your governor’, which was aired in some local radio stations Ekiti, Fayemi dodged questions asked about his alleged tactically wade off inquisitive panelists and refused to comment on his alleged presidential ambition. When asked whether he would be vying for the plum position in 2023, a smiling Fayemi who waited until the question was asked simply said: “let’s end the programme for today”. With that statement, the anchor, the General Manager of the Broadcasting Service of Ekiti State, Mr Olu Popoola ended the programme.
