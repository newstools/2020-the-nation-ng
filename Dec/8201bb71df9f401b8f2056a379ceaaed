Barely 48 hours to the commencement of the proposed nationwide membership registration, update and re-validation of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), the party has postponed the exercise by four weeks. Initially slated to begin on December 12, the exercise has now been fixed for the second week in January, 2021. The Chairman of the Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) and Yober State Governor Mai Mala Buni announced the new date to reporters yesterday at the party’s national secretariat in Abuja. Buni, who spoke through the Caretaker Committee Secretary, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, said the postponement was to ensure solid foundation for the exercise. He said: “As you are all aware, the membership registration, update and revalidation of our great party, was supposed to begin on Saturday, December 12, 2020. “On account of several factors, however, including the fast-approaching Christmas and End of Year celebrations, as well as the interest of our Christian members, and the objective of ensuring maximum participation, the CECPC has decided to shift the date of the exercise to the second week of January 2021. “The CECPC sincerely regrets any inconveniences that may arise out of the change in date, but appeals for the understanding of the public in the interest of preparing a solid foundation for a successful exercise.”
