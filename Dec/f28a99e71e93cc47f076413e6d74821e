Residents of some of security-challenged communities in Rafi Local Government Area of Niger State are fleeing their homes following renewed attacks by bandits. In the past week, over two people have been killed, 20 kidnapped and many others injured as bandits attacked villages. Affected communities include Rafi-Doko, Yakila, Katako and other surrounding villages. The villagers were seen entering Tegina with loads on their head. Some residents of Tegina said the villagers are asking for a place to set up camp. A source said: “These people came into town today with their loads. They are just moving up and down searching for where to stay.” Another said: “Some of them are staying with relatives. Over 300 people came into town today (yesterday), I saw them myself. A lot of them are still around.” The displaced people decried the incessant attacks, describing it as unrestricted. They also lamented the government’s inaction. The Nation learnt that stakeholders are meeting to find solutions to the situation. Director-General of the Niger State Emergency Management Agency (NSEMA) Ibrahim Inga confirmed that people are fleeing their communities to safety. He said the government is not silent about the issue but putting in measures to give succour to the people.
