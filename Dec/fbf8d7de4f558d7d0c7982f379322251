Jigawa State Government has spent over N3.6 billion to provide free health care delivery services for expectant mothers and children below five years in the last four years, Governor Muhammadu Badaru Abubakar has said. He spoke yesterday at the Dutse General Hospital, Dutse at the launch of the state’s contributory health care programme. Abubakar said: “This administration has spent N900 million annually in the provision of free health care services to expectant mothers and children below five years in the last four years.” He added: “Considering challenges in the health care services, particularly families, low income individuals and other vulnerable segments of the society, especially with the high cost of health care services, the government has increased its monthly funding from N15 million to N75million.” The governor said the services covered expectant mothers, children under five years, accident victims, correctional inmates and boarding students across the state. He said: “The contributory health care scheme is a further effort in ensuring an overall objective of healthy and productive population through access to comprehensive, appropriate, affordable, efficient, equitable and quality essential health care.”
