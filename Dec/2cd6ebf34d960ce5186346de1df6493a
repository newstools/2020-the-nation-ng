Operatives of the Nigerian Navy (NN) on Sunday night saved 12 passengers from drowning after a commercial boat capsized on Lagos waterways. The incident occurred around 8:10 pm along the Tarkwa Bay axis as a result of strong waves caused by the activity of another passenger boat that was transiting the channel. According to the spokesman, Western Naval Command (WNC) Commander Thomas Otuji, operatives attached to the Forward Operations Base (FOB) TARKWA BAY and men of the Special Boat Service (SBS) who were patrolling the axis immediately raced to the scene and averted a major disaster. He said the passengers who were all rescued, were immediately evacuated to the Naval Dockyard Medical Centre for attention. “All passengers on board the ill-fated boat were rescued alive and conveyed to the Naval Medical Centre, Naval Dockyard, Victoria Island Lagos for immediate medical care. “Once again, boat operators and passengers are strongly advised to adhere to safety guidelines and measures before embarking on any trip. “Relevant unions and associations are further advised to ensure that safety gears are provided by their members for passengers and to enforce the compulsory use of the safety gears by all passengers. “Additionally, boat drivers should be subjected to regular and mandatory training and medical checks. These measures are necessary because the mishap in the first place was caused by an unprofessional boat driver with poor judgement and with no regard to the safety of others while plying the waters. “On our part, the Western Naval Command will continue to render necessary assistance in fulfilment of its mandate on aid to civil authority, especially the security and safety of lives and property in its area of responsibility. “Accordingly, members of the public are enjoined to remain patriotic and support measures emplaced by the command to checkmate untoward actions by criminal elements in the maritime sector,” he said.
