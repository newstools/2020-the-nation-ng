 LAGOS State, through the Office of Civic Engagement, has begun a research for 1,140 indigent expectant mothers under its ‘Mother Infant and Child’ (MICH) programme. The first two cohorts of expectant mothers have signed the attestation forms to confirm their participation in the three-month research. The 20 expectant mothers in the control groups, drawn from Mosan-Okunola and Ipaja–Ayobo LCDAs in Alimosho Local Government Area, are the first set of participants to sign relevant documents for the research. Special Adviser to the Governor on Civic Engagement Princess Aderemi Adebowale, who supervised the signing, said the research phase was to assess the impact of the MICH nutritious food and supplements on the expectant mothers with full monitoring of their existing conditions, medical and social indices, starting from December 1, till the next three months for the unborn children. “It will also run same throughout the pregnancy to delivery and post-partum. The participants in the control group would be given MICH plus food packs and supplements weekly for three months before delivery, starting from the start date of the research,” she added. Adebowale said the research would help government ensure participating women receive qualitative healthcare and follow-up through home visits by a dedicated team of public and state-approved private community health workers andmedical consultants.
