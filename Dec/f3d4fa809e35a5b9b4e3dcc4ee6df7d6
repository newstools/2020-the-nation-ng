 Nollywood actress, Angela Eguavoen, has expressed distaste in how curvy women are easily labeled promiscuous for being bold and beautiful. The actress took to her Instagram page to bear her mind on how people easily assume that all curvy women sleep around to earn a living. She said that as opposed to the general belief, most women with curvy figures are mostly indoors and their social life cannot be compared to reality. “Being a curvy beautiful woman who is pretty comfortable in her skin is so hard. People automatically think you are lost, people quickly assume you must be a runs girl, especially if you are really expressive, no freaking way you are reserved, no way you aren’t a bad bitch who is a cheerful giver of her body, no way you are smart or intelligent” said Angela. She continues: “they think your body does it all for you until they come really close and realize you are nothing like what they thought you were. Often times they want to punch themselves in the face because you are actually hardworking, talented, smart, intelligent, homely, you’ve got your flaws like every other person and you can be a freak too. Eguavoen however advised women to embrace themselves and never let what people think of bringing them down. “Dear curvy women, embrace who you are fully, do not be intimidated, you were specially sculpted by the greatest sculpture you did not create yourself, remain true to you. People go dey alright las las”.
