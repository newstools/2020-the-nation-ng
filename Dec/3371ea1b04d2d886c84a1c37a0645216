Flying Eagles of Nigeria suffered a damaging 1-0 loss to their West African rivals, Black Satellites of Ghana, in their second and final group game of the WAFU B U-20 tournament. Ladan Bosso’s boys had begun their tournament with 1-1draw against Cote d’Ivoire and needed to win against Ghana to have any chance of qualifying for the semi-finals. The Flying Eagles started the clash Stade Charles de Gaulles on the front foot, but just like in the first game, they could not make their dominance count. Nigeria had the ball in the net two minutes before the break, but it was ruled out due to a handball in the build-up. The second half started the same way the first ended with Nigeria dominating possession, but they could not convert their chances. They would later rue the missed chances as Ghana took the lead eight minutes from time through a well-taken freekick. Although Nigeria tried to find a way back into the game, the Black Satellites held on for an important win. The result leaves the Flying Eagles on the brink and will need Ghana to beat Cote d’Ivoire by more than a goal to have a chance of qualifying for the semi-final stages.
