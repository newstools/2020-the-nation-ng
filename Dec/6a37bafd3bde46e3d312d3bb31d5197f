BBNaija Lockdown winner Olamilekan Agbeleshe aka Laycon has announced his plans to release his debut album in 2021. Laycon made the announcement to his fans during his GOtv Iconic tour in Uyo, Akwa Ibom, a few days ago. During a meet and greet session at the Ebong Uko hall, Monty Suites, Laycon dropped the news to the excitement of many of his fans. During his two-day tour of the city, Laycon paid a courtesy visit to the Hon. Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Ini Ememobong at the Ministry’s Headquarters at Idongesit Nkanga Secretariat, Uyo. He continued his tour with media rounds at the city’s top radio stations and then a town storm where he met up with fans at Ifot Ekpene road and Abak road before making an appearance at the opening ceremony of the Christmas Village in the state. This is coming days after Laycon visited his hometown, the quiet town of Abeokuta. In Abeokuta, Laycon began with media rounds and town storms where he met up with fans in the city in areas such as the popular Kuto garage and market, the bustling Oke Ilewo street, and the Sapon market. He also made a quick stop at the ‘amala halaga’ joint in Pansheke where he thanked the locals for their support during his time in the BBNaija house. Lucky fans walked home with autographed cards by Laycon and other giveaways courtesy Gotv.
