Four convicts who escaped from the Oko Prison in Edo State during the #EndSARS protest have been rearrested. The suspects, including a death row convict and an ex-soldier, were arrested in Kaduna State where they had resorted to robbery and car snatching. They were arrested by the Inspector-General of Police Intelligence Response Team (IRT) and Special Tactical Squad (STS) of the Force Intelligence Bureau (FIB) Abuja. Police spokesman Frank Mba said the convicts – Adebayo Opeyemi (ex-soldier), Onorede Benjamin (on death row), Peter Felix Osas and Hudu Musa – colluded with others, on bail, to continue incrime. Mba, who paraded the suspects in Abuja yesterday, said Benjamin, the de facto leader of the new gang, snatched a vehicle 30 minutes after his escape. Benjamin drove to Kaduna and sold the car with Musa’s help. According to Mba, Musa specialised in selling stolen cars at border communities and had nine months left of his prison term before he escaped. He added that 34 persons were arrested for crimes including robbery, car theft, unlawful possession and illegal dealing in weapons. Among them was a woman arrested for illegal arms dealing. Eight cars, eight AK-47 rifles and other assorted weapons were recovered, he said.
