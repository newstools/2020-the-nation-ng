 THE Justice Yunusa Musa-led Governorship Election Petitions Tribunal in Edo State has refused to strike out the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its candidate in the September 19 election, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, as respondents in a petition. Obaseki and the PDP are asking the tribunal to strike out APC and Ize-Iyamu from the petition by the Action Democratic Party (ADP) and its candidate, Iboi Emmanuel. ADP and Emmanuel prayed the tribunal to disqualify Obaseki for his controversial first degree certificate from the University of Ibadan (UI), nullify votes cast for him, and order the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to conduct a fresh election involving other qualified candidates, excluding PDP and Obaseki. But Justice Musa refused to dismiss ADP’s petition and also declined to strike out APC and Ize-Iyamu as respondents, thereby reserving rulings in the matters until the final judgment. The tribunal opted to hear ADP’s petition on its merit.
