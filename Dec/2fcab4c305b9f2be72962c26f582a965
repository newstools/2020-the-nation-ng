The Managing Director of ASB Valiant, an indigenous firm with interests in the energy and maritime sector of the economy, Ayodele Ikumapayi, has called for more private sector participation in the country’s energy space. Besides, he wants more control given to operators in the sector as this will ensure that more funds are available to ensure further development of the energy sector. Ikumapayi, spoke on the sideline of the company’s 10th year anniversary celebration and CEO Dinner award night for workers of the firm held at the Raddison Blu Hotel, Victoria Island, Lagos, at the weekend. ASB Valiant, he explained is focused on entrenching her activities, especially in the area of energy in Nigeria and Africa. This is why the company has spread its tentacles to other African countries like Chad Republic. “Today we are not just operating in Nigeria but also in Chad Republic and we see more opportunities coming because we are focused on developing solutions for Africa. We are an African oriented organisation that is why we are expanding our operations beyond the shores of Nigeria,” Ikumapayi said. According to him, the last five years has been of a bit up and down for the firm, yet, staff stood firmly to ensure that the murky waters was navigated successfully. For this, he further said, it was apt to reward and appreciate their efforts. “It is easy sometimes to talk of a company’s success and forget the people who make it happen. So we decided to forget the challenges and appreciate the workers. About seven of them were recognised and awarded,” he explained. Some of the workers recognised include Temitope Ogungbemi (Chad office); Segun Ajayi; Olumide Oderinde and John Ibiwunmi, who emerged as the ‘Employee of the Year.’
