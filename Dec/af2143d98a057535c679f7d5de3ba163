 THE Court of Appeal sitting in Ado-Ekiti has dismissed an appeal to overturn the verdict of an Ado-Ekiti High Court on the relocation of Ilejemeje Local Government headquarters from Iye Ekiti to Eda Oniyo. In a unanimous verdict, Justices Fatima Akinbami, T.N Orji-Abadua and Paul Elechi struck out the appeal filed by the Oniye of Iye-Ekiti, Oba Jonathan Adeleye-Oni, and the President, Iye Development Association, Elijah Kupolati, for lack of merit. Delivering judgment, Justice Akinbami affirmed the verdict of the lower court on November 19, 2019, which held that there was no merit in the originating summons of Oba Adeleye-Oni and Kupolati. The Appeal Court held that “the case of the appellant as presently constituted in this appeal has been finally determined by the Supreme Court in Suit No SC/194/2008. The appeal is devoid of any merit and is hereby dismissed.” The state government had, following a judgment of the Supreme Court dated December 14, 2018, which declared Eda Oniyo as the valid headquarters of the council, relocated the council’s seat of power from Ilejemeje to Eda Oniyo. But the Oniye and the Kupolati dragged Governor Kayode Fayemi; the Attorney-General, Olawale Fapohunda; and the Eleda of Eda Oniyo, Oba Julius Awolola to an Ado- Ekiti High Court, to challenge their action.
