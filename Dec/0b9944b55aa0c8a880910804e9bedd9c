 PROFESSOR Abdullahi Mainasara of the College of Sciences, Usmanu Danfodiyo University, Sokoto has advocated full autonomy to local government councils to empower them to adequately fund basic education. The Chemical Pathology lecturer spoke at the weekend in Sokoto at the graduation of the Class of  2020, Blue Crescent, Secondary School,  Mabera,  Sokoto. Mainasara, who is also the Chairman of the Parent Teacher Association (PTA) of the school said: “The primary foundation of education should be accorded  priority with adequate attention for the success of other levels.” Represented by the second Vice Chairman of the association, Dr. Abdulrazaq Olatunii, Mainasara lamented that the education sector was not getting priority attention, warning that “the earlier this ugly trend is reversed, the better for the nation, just as no society can rise above the level of its education.” Nevertheless, the PTA Chairman expressed delight with the nearly one hundred per cent successes recorded by the school in the 2020 SSCE conducted by WAEC and NECO. Addressing the graduands, he admonished them to be good ambassadors of their parents and their alma mater. “You should also steer clear of all acts capable of jeopardising your future educational development, as you are moving ahead into tertiary educational institutions,” he said. In his speech, Principal of the School, Mr Yetu Joseph said 102 pupils graduated in the 2020 set, recording about 100 per cent in all subjects. Myriad of awards were doled out to the teachers and graduating students who have excelled during the year in review.
