As part of efforts to boost the morale of Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs), the Nigerian Air Force has unveiled two refurbished airmen accommodation inside the Sam Ethnam Air Force Base (SEAFB) in Ikeja, Lagos. Chief of Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, said the service was aware of the myriads of accommodation and infrastructural challenges faced by SEAFB. Abubakar, represented by the Air Officer Commanding (AOC) Logistics Command, Air Vice Marshal (AVM) Lawal Alao, said the NAF was committed to the yearly renovation and provision of accommodation for personnel to address the accommodation and infrastructure challenges. He said: “As this administration continues with infrastructural renewal in all NAF Bases towards the achievement of a decent and conducive environment, I enjoin you all to rededicate yourselves and continue to add value towards making the service more relevant and effective in addressing the current and future security challenges in the country. “Resources are not readily available to satisfy all our needs as a fighting force. Nevertheless, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, President Muhammadu Buhari has continued to ensure that our needs are prioritised. “We, therefore, remain grateful to him for his constant support. Let me also appreciate the Air Officer Commanding Logistic Command for his untiring efforts in ensuring prompt logistic support to other elements of the NAF.” NAF recently inaugurated a 30-by-one airmen transit studio apartment at the 041 Communications Depot, Shasha in Lagos, with a commitment to gradually phase out old structures in the barrack.
