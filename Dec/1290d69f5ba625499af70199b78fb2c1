 TWENTY corps members deployed to Anambra State for their service year have been empowered by the National Youths Service Corps (NYSC) to enforce compliance with the COVID 19 safety protocols within the orientation camp. The corps members drawn from 10 platoons in the camp are to assist 12 officials of the scheme. They are also mandated to educate the camp community on the dangers of the dreaded disease. Inaugurating the team, tagged, “COVID19 Compliance/Sanitation Vanguards”, at the Orientation Camp, in Umuawulu/Mbaukwu, the NYSC State Coordinator, Mr. Kehinde Aremu, said the corps members are to apprehend violators of the safety protocols. He said: “You as Vanguards are charged with the dual responsibility of educating the camp community on the dangers of the dreaded disease as well as enforcing compliance of the COVID-19 safety protocols. “You are being backed by enormous powers to bring to book, any of your colleagues, who would run foul of the laws governing the compliance of the COVID19 safety protocols, such as wearing of face masks, regular washing of hands and the proper use of the handwashing basins and soap provided at strategic points at the camp.” According to Aremu, the camp management has zero-tolerance for indiscriminate trashing of waste. “With this inauguration, you are empowered as the most powerful group aside the camp officials. You are mandated to use the powers conferred on you to deliver on the assignment given to you.”
