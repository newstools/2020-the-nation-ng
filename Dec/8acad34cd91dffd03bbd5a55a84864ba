 Rising welterweight boxer, Isaac ‘I-Star’ Chukwudi, has warned his next opponent Taiwo ‘Gentle Boy’ Olowu not to dream of lasting beyond three of the eight-round challenge duel. Their fight is one of the seven lined up to hold at GOtv Boxing Night 22 on New Year’s Day. “I’m confident that I can finish him off in the first round, but i will do so in instalments over three rounds, so that fans can enjoy the fight. He’s a baby when it comes to boxing,” bragged I-Star.
