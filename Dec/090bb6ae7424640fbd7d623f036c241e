 THE Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, on Tuesday received the newborn prince, Tadenikawo Adesoji Aderemi Ogunwusi. Oba Ogunwusi, during the eight-day celebration, named the newborn prince after the 49th monarch of the ancient town. A statement by the Ooni spokesman, Moses Olafare, said Oba Ogunwusi released the pictures of the prince to the public.  “The prince came in a motorcade to the entrance of the palace and was received by the Agba Ife led by Obalufe of Ife, Oba Idowu Adediwura, the Modewa led by Lowa Adimula of Ife, High chief Adeola Adeyeye and Emeses led by Sarun Oriowo Oyeyemi. They ushered the prince, his mother, Queen Shilekunola Ogunwusi,  the families, friends and associates from Akure into the Ooni’s palace. “The prince and his mother first stopped at Ile-Nla within the palace courtyard where the families and relatives of Ogunwusi royal families and friends were awaiting the arrival of the baby, from where they proceeded to Emese’s court, where the prince was finally handed over to his joyful father, Ooni Ogunwusi, who came out through the sacred Ile Igbo in accordance with the full culture and traditions of Ile-Ife as always observed whenever the reigning Ooni receives his newly-born prince into the palace after the necessary rites of 21 days,” the statement said. After receiving his son from the Ooni, accompanied by spiritual aides, they swiftly took him straight into the inner chamber of Ile Igbo for the necessary spiritual confirmation as demanded by the tradition. The monarch later came out from Ile Igbo with smiles and majestic dance steps, welcomed by thunderous shouts of “Kabiyesi ooooo!” “Kabiyesi ooooo!” from the waiting crowd, who watched with excitement as Ooni handed over the prince to his elated mother, who danced with the baby in her hands to her apartment at the palace.
