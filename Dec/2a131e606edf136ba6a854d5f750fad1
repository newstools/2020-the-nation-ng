The governorship candidate of the Peopleâ€™s Democratic Party in the October 10 gubernatorial election in Ondo State, Eyitayo Jegede, has assured party supporters that the party would soon take over power in the state. Jegede who spoke on Tuesday at the commissioning of the rebuilt burnt state party secretariat in Akure urged all PDP members to work in unison for the success of the party. The Ondo PDP secretariat was razed during the #ENDSARS protest. Jegede told newsmen that the PDP was too big to be destroyed and enjoined Ondo PDP members to always consider what they could do for the betterment of the party. He commended Prince Godday Erewa for the rebuilding of the party secretariat. Prince Erewa, on his part, said he offered to renovate the secretariat to boost the morale of the party members and its supporters. He said it would not portray a good image if the secretariat was left in shambles, despite that it was rented. Erewa also promised to be at the forefront of the building of a permanent secretariat for the party in the state. State Chairman of the Ondo PDP, Mr. Fatai Adams, said the secretariat was burnt to humiliate the party. Adams said the PDP was gaining more momentum in the hearts of the people of the state. He noted that in the course of reconstruction and rehabilitation of the secretariat, Senator Ayo Akinyelure, representing Ondo Central Senatorial District and Senator Nicholas Tofowomo, representing Ondo North Senatorial District donated submersible borehole and 400 Italian made plastic chairs with four plastic tables respectively. Senator Akinyelure also donated a new 32- seater Coaster Bus to replace the burnt one.
