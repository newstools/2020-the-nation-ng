 Osun State of Ministry of Justice yesterday took over the prosecution of a leader of #EndSARS movement, Emmanuel Adebisi (aka Captain), from the Department of State Services (DSS). Adebisi has been standing trial before a State Magistrates’ Court sitting in Osogbo, the state capital, for alleged forgery, impersonation and illegal possession of Nigerian Army uniform.  The Nation recalls that the presiding Magistrate, Mr. Isola Omisade, refused an oral bail application by Adebisi’s counsel, A. C. Olaniyi, and ordered that a formal bail application be made for him. The magistrate ordered that the defendant be remanded in prison till the next adjourned date. Prosecutor from the DSS announced his appearance and a lawyer from the Ministry of Justice, Oyedele Akintayo, told the court that the state was interested in the matter and ready for the prosecution. Omisade granted the prayer and Olaniyi urged the court to rule on the formal bail application he filed and served to the prosecution team.  Akintayo told the court that the bailiff had not served him any application. The magistrate ordered the court bailiff to serve the Ministry of Justice.  He adjourned the matter till tomorrow for the argument of bail.
