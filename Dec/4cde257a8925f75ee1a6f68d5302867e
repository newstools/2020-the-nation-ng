Margaret Keenan, a 90-year-old woman, is the first to receive Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine in the United Kingdom (UK). The UK began a mass vaccination programme against the infection on Tuesday. The vaccine will be administered on the elderly first, and about 70 hospitals have been primed to participate in the programme. The programme is aimed at protecting the most vulnerable. The UK is the first country to use the vaccine which offers 95 per cent protection against COVID-19. On December 3, the country’s MHRA, the health regulator, approved a mass rollout of the vaccine. The UK is among the worst COVID-19 hit countries in the world. Prime Minister Boris Johnson had imposed a lockdown twice to slow down the spread of the infection.
