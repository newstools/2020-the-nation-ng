Kwara State government on Wednesday cautioned tertiary institutions against flouting COVID-19 protocols and guidelines. It urged them to put precautionary measures in place in their respective schools.  The government last week announced that second wave of the pandemic had hit the state. The Commissioner for Tertiary Education, Science and Technology Hajia Saadatu Modibbo Kawu handed down the warning at the 12th Convocation of Batholomew College of Health Technology, Shao, Moro Local Government Area. She said the need for strict adherence to COVID-19 safety protocols by the tertiary institutions becomes necessary because of the large number of students population and the recent spike in the pandemic cases. The commissioner, who was represented by the Director of Health in the ministry, Alhaji Garuba Mohammed, added: “It is pertinent to note that COVID-19 has been ravaging the World since the beginning of this year. “All precautionary measures should, therefore, be put in place and the protocols should be observed as laid down by Nigeria Council For Diseases Control. We pray that we shall all be free from the deadly disease.” Hajia Kawu hailed the proprietor of the college for bridging the gap of health manpower needs in the state. She cautioned that the government “is not willing to compromise on standards. You should, therefore, ensure that students per course ratio allowed by the regulatory bodies of your programmes is strictly adhered to.” The Proprietor of the college, Batholomew Owoicho, said he established the institution to complement government’s efforts in producing adequate manpower for the health sector.
