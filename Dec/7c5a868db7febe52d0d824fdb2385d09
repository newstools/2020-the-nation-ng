 THE PRESIDENT-GENERAL, Ladipo International Market, Mr. Jude Nwankwo, has stressed the need for cleanliness in markets in Lagos State. He spoke when he led the executives of the market on a cleaning exercise and awareness of the multimillion naira auto market. Nwankwo, who went round the market to ensure that members kept it clean, said their objective is to do regular cleaning of the market, noting that cleanliness is next to godliness. He said the association held the exercise on the second Friday of every month from morning till noon until the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown and #EndSARS protests led to its suspension. ‘’Now we are back,’’ he said. Nwankwo thanked God that despite the spike in the number of deaths arising from the pandemic in the state, no one died from the disease in the market.
