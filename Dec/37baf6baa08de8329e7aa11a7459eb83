 MINISTER of Youth and Sports Development Mr. Sunday Dare has taken the message for increased testing for COVID-19 to the Mangu Permanent Orientation Camp of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) in Plateau State. His advocacy is coming amidst recent spikes in cases of COVID-19. After reviewing the COVID-19 control protocols with camp officials, the minister took the test at the station where arriving corps members are screened. Dare, thereafter, called for the strengthening and expansion of the testing capacity at NYSC orientation camp, urging people to strictly observe the preventive measures put in place to slow down the spread of the virus. He said: “I want to make sure that the testing station is properly set up and working the way it should.  The same should go for all our orientation camps across the country. “There is a second wave of COVID-19 being reported and testing is one of the measures to curtail the spread. Even if someone should test positive, it will only help ensure the person gets timely medical attention. “I urge corps members and Nigerians in general to take the test, especially when showing symptoms or they have been in areas where there is a high incidence of the virus.” The minister, who addressed the corps members at Mangu Orientation Camp, urged them to sign up for the initiatives of the Ministry of Youth and Sports Development that are aimed at investing in youths. The minister stressed that programmes like the N75 billion Nigeria Youth Investment Fund (NYIF) has already been rolled out alongside the training opportunities provided under the DEEL initiative.
