 The Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS) has recorded 57,399 members by the Third Quarter of last year, representing 0.65 per cent growth, a report by the National Pension Commission has shown. The membership moved from 8.78 million contributors at the end of the preceding quarter to 8.84 million. The growth was driven by the Retirement Savings Account (RSA) Scheme, which had an increase of 57,727 contributors, representing 0.66 per cent. However, membership of the Closed Pension Fund Administration (CPFA) Scheme declined by 328 members, standing at 17,548 while the Approved Existing Scheme (AES) membership remained at 40,951. Similarly, the report showed that the RSA registrations hit 8,780,336 as at the third quarter, moving from 8,722,609 as at second quarter, 2019, representing a growth of 0.66 per cent. The growth could be attributed to the increased level of compliance by the private sector as a result of the various steps taken by the commission to improve compliance and coverage, as well as marketing strategies of the Pension Fund Administrators (PFAs). On RSA registrations by PFA market share, the report stated that the ranking of PFAs by some registered contributors showed a redistribution of the market share across the various groups. During the period under review, the market shares of the bottom three, five and 10 PFAs had continued to grow, while those of the top three, five and 10 slightly dipped. The shares of the bottom five and 10 PFAs increased from 3.88 and 14.98 per cent, in the second quarter of last year to 3.90 and 14.99 per centÂ  as at the end of the reporting period. Also, the market shares of top five and 10 PFAs dropped from 53.41 and 78.59 per cent in the previous quarter to 53.40 and 78.58 per cent as at the end of third quarter, last year.
