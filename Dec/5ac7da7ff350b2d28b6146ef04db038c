Lewis Hamilton has admitted that he was physically ‘destroyed’ but is ‘grateful’ to be alive after his first F1 race back after contracting the coronavirus. Hamilton, who has since recovered from the virus, finished in third place at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, with Max Verstappen and Valtteri Bottas finishing ahead of him. After missing the previous race in Bahrain, Hamilton was pleased to finish on the podium but admitted that he wasn’t feeling good. “I’m destroyed. I do not feel good,’ Hamilton told Sky Sports. “But I’m happy, I’m grateful. I’m alive, and I live to fight another day. “I still managed to finish off the season with a podium so I’m thankful to the team that I was able to contribute. “Considering the past couple of weeks I’ve had I really am generally happy with the weekend. That was a really hard race for me physically. All the year physically I’ve been fine but today I definitely wasn’t.”
