A delegation of Ondo State Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leaders yesterday visited former Ekiti State Governor Ayo Fayose. The leaders, led by Senator Nicolas Tofowomo, paid glowing tributes to Fayose, “whose commitment and leadership credentials remain unrivalled, either in or out of office.” Tofowomo pledged that the PDP in Ondo State would vote for Eddy Olafeso as the national vice chairman and other candidates presented by the Fayose group. He condemned the self-serving attitude of Governor Seyi Makinde, “who must realise that Ondo State is independent of Oyo State and not tied to anyone’s apron strings.” Tofowomo decried Makinde’s leadership style as not unifying and edifying to the party. “He must begin to lead by example.” Reacting, Dr. Fayose said he remained steadfast and loyal to the party, adding that only people in Governor Makinde’s group were insinuating that he was in the All Progressives Congress (APC). He condemned the attitude and warned Makinde to desist from insulting him any further, as he would not hesitate to respond. The Ondo State delegation approved the suspension of the ineffectual Zonal Chairman, Dayo Ogungbenro and demanded that other members of the Zonal Caretaker Committee should take full grip of the party in the zone. It was further resolved that they would not have anything to do with the Oyinlola Peace Committee.
