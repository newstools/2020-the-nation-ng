Isioma Princess Andrew-Odiakaose, the Director of Omalicha Body care and Founder of ICLEDI, an NGO that focuses on youth and women empowerment has revealed why she is passionate about helping youth achieve their purpose in Life. In a live chat with The Nation, she said she helps young people make informed choices and live a purposeful life fearlessly. Isioma narrated that she made a lot of wrong choices in her teenage years and in her twenties. She said “I was fearful and always needed approval from people before embarking on any project I had in mind.” “As a youth, I was multi-talented yet confused, because I didn’t know where to focus my energy and finances, which made me move around in circles and never do all that sets my soul on fire.” She revealed. The mistake made as a young champ shaped her life and sprung up her passion for helping young people who are confused about making the right choices in life and discover their life purposes. Speaking on her achievements on transforming the lives of young people, Isioma revealed that she has spoken to more than 15,000 young people, and has helped quite a number of them to be shamelessly courageous and live a purposeful life. She will be hosting a masterclass tagged Pro-Max in two cities in Nigeria and will be teaching young people on how to discover their purpose, turn pains into purpose, self-confidence, stress and time management. In addition, Isioma will be teaching how to use fruits and vegetables to heal the body and reduce ageing too.
