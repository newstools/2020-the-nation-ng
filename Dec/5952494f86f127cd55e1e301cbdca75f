Leranmo said he had duplicated his case file to the office of the Directorate of Public Prosecution (DPP) for legal advice. The defendant’s plea was not taken as his lawyer, Ola Abiola, sought for a short date of adjournment till the outcome of the advice from DPP. Chief Magistrate Abdulhamid Lawal remanded Goji in the Correctional centre pending the legal advice from the DPP office. He adjourned the matter till December 17 for further hearing.
