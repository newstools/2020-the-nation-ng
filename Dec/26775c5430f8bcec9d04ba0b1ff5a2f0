INEC suit No. FHC/ABJ/CS/562/2004 which ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission to restore the suppressed Mata and Mbagwa State Constituencies in Ushongo Local Government Area of Benue State; “Further notes the decision of the Supreme Court on the 10/10/2018 in the case of INEC v. GUMA LGA and 2 Ors suit No. SC/195/2016 wherein the apex court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeal delivered on 16/06/2015 in suit No.CA/MK/137/2012 on the immediate restoration of Agasha State Constituency in Guma Local Government of Benue State; “Recalls that sequel to the said decisions  of the Federal High Court  and that of the Supreme Court  on the restoration of the Mata, Mbagwa and Agasha State Constituencies respectively,  and upon the request of INEC, the House of Representatives and the Senate on 14th May 2019, May 21, 2019 and May 28th, 2019 at the twilight of the 8th National Assembly respectively passed a concurrent resolution unanimously  approving the restoration  of two State Constituencies of Mata and Mbagwa  from Ushongo State , and the restoration of Agasha State  Constituency from Guma Local Government Area of Benue State  in compliance with the orders of the courts  and the provision of Section 115 of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, as amended; “Recalls further that due to the dissolution of the 8th National Assembly, its concurrent resolution on the restoration of the two suppressed state constituencies from Ushongo State Constituency and the restoration of Agasha State Constituency from Guma Local Government could not be transmitted to INEC for implementation hence the need for another resolution to approve the exercise as ordered by the Courts and in compliance with Sections 91 and 115 of the 1999 Nigerian Constitution; and “Observes that the delay in complying with the order of the Federal High Court in Suit No FHC/ABJ/CS/562/2004 and that of the Supreme Court in Suit No.SC/195/2016  on the restoration of Mata and Mbagwa State constituencies from Ushongo State Constituency  and Agasha State Constituency from Guma State constituency of Benue State is a serious constitutional  aberration against the spirit of Section 91 and 115 of the 1999 Nigerian constitution and has over the years unjustly denied the people of Mata , Mbagwa and Agasha  of their due representation in the Benue State House of Assembly.”
