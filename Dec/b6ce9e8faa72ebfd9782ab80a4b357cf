The All Progressives Congress (APC) has said it is assured of victory in Saturday’s senatorial by-election in Lagos East. It described as laughable the “faceless and nameless opinion poll” that had allotted imaginary victory to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Lagos APC Publicity Secretary Seye Oladejo said in a statement that the opposition party had indulged in falsehood, fiction and hallucination typical of a party going into extinction. He said the fact that the background, credentials and integrity of their candidate have been subjected to public scrutiny would naturally elicit face-saving defence mechanism. In his view, it smacked of bad manners for a party to award marks to itself in a contest that is still days ahead. Oladejo said: “Our candidate, Tokunbo Abiru, remains the candidate to beat. He represents a refreshing breath of politics with a difference. “Lagos East deserves a senator with an  impeccable character, unquestionable credentials and a rare combination of private and public sector experience.” He added: “While we acknowledge the incredible diligence of Gbadamosi in the social media, he will do well to note for future escapades that elections are won by reaching out to the real people in the home steads, market places, community leaders, youth organisations etc.”
