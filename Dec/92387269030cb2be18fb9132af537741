The Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Ibok-Ete Ibas, has decried the involvement of Naval personnel in illicit oil bunkering and crude oil theft. He lamented that while there are significant achievements in the fight against this Maritime crime, there are pockets of personnel still colluding with criminals to sabotage the effort, adding that “the Navy in collaboration with other security agencies strives to protect the economic mainstay of the country through various operations.”
Ibas, who stated this during the decoration of newly-promoted Rear Admirals at the Navy Headquarters, warned that “any act collusion with criminals or sabotage of measures emplaced to checkmate illegalities will be met with stiff sanctions in accordance with the law of the land. Meanwhile, addressing the newly promoted senior officers, the CNS urged them to be more dedicated and display unalloyed loyalty to the President, Commander-in-Chief, adding that “your ingenuity resourcefulness and integrity will be required as senior officers of the Navy to reposition the Service in order to discharge its constitutional role for the security and prosperity of Nigeria.” He stressed further that, “note that as leaders of the service, you are expected to be above board and ensure that your subordinates equally buy into the zero-tolerance stance of the NN against all forms of illegalities and criminalities at sea and ashore.” The Minister of Defence in his remarks insisted that promotion in the military “is a reward for hard work, patriotism, and loyalty to service and country.” He continued that “an officer must therefore have these qualities as a qualification for consideration to ascend the pyramidal ladder. I am pleased to note that the 18 senior officers being decorated today strive to meet these requirements and remained true to their professional calling.” 18 Commodores were decorated with the rank of Rear Admirals.
