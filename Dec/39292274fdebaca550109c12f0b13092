The Niger Delta Liberation Force (NDLF) has called for a probe of abandoned projects in Akwa Ibom State, as well as federal allocations to the local government councils. It urged the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) to dig into past and present budgets of the state under Governor Udom Emmanuel. A statement at the weekend by Capt. Victor Eyoh, Gen. Ekpo Ekpo, and four others, alleged that the Emmanuel-led administration was fond of budgeting and releasing funds to contractors for projects, which are either left uncompleted or abandoned. The group threatened to shut oil production if the anti-graft agencies do not probe the acts and ensure justice. The statement reads: “We call on the EFCC and ICPC to probe activities of these councils to unravel the can of worms, and whoever is found culpable should face the law. “From our investigations, the government has developed the habit of budgeting for projects and releasing funds to contractors, while the projects are either left uncompleted or totally abandoned. Most times, the same projects are budgeted for in subsequent years.” NDLF also lamented the spate of uncompleted projects across the state, such as the Eket re-modelling project, Eket Township stadium, the flyover project at Ekom Iman, among others. Commissioner for Information and Strategy Ini Ememobong did not respond to a text message sent to him as at last night.
