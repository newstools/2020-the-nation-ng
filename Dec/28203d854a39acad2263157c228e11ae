 AKWA Ibom State Governor Udom Emmanuel has promised to complete all projects initiated by his administration. Emmanuel spoke during the swearing in of local government chairmen and Vice Chairmen on Monday in Uyo. He said: “You have been elected to serve your people diligently at a tough time. Serving the people at this time, according to the Bible, falls under the end times. Serving the people at this end time is a difficult task, you must bear that in mind. “We have only one government, one state and we are of one people. We are developing a state where we don’t place much emphasis on the party you belong to, but what you can do for your people, and what you can do to help us achieve our purpose. “Political party is just a platform, but what matters most is God giving you that opportunity to serve. Every elected person is a servant of God, you must realise that and act that way. So I charge you to work towards our completion agenda.” The governor admonished the council executives to stay focused and not to be distracted by negative criticisms and political propaganda.
