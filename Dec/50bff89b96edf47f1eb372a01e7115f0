 THE death of former Minister of Justice and Attorney-General of the Federation, Bola Ige, was devastating to the Second Republic Governor of Kaduna State, the late Balarabe Musa. President of the Bola Ige Centre for Justice, Awa Bamiji, said Musa was shocked at Ige’s death. He said: “On his way to Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s 60th birthday colloquium in 2012, the late Musa told me point that he was yet to believe that Ige, a sitting Attorney-General of the Federation under former President Olusegun Obasanjo could be murdered easily and up till 2012, nothing had happened. “He said he would be calling me Bola Ige henceforth to appreciate me for keeping the flag flying through the annual memorial symposium we hold annual.” Bamiji added that Musa was his role model in his younger days of activism because of his integrity, principles and love for Nigeria. Musa, who held office from October 1979 until he was impeached on June 23, 1981, died on November 11.
