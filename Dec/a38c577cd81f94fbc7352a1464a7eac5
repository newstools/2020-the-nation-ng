Amid debates about the existence of security ‘aliens’, Haim Eshed, a former Israeli space security chief, says there is an existence of “Galactic Federation” and U.S. President Donald Trump knows about it. The ex-security chief, 87, disclosed that Israel and the U.S. have been dealing with the ‘aliens’ for years. Eshed stressed that agreements had been made between the ‘aliens’ and the U.S., which ostensibly were made because they wished to research and understand “the fabric of the universe,” the Jerusalem Post reported, quoting an Israeli media outlet, Yediot Aharonot. “The cooperation includes a secret underground base on Mars, where there are American and ‘alien’ representatives,” Eshed reportedly said. The Israeli newspaper said Eshed emphasised in the interview that the U.S. President Donald Trump was aware of the ‘aliens’ and that he was “on the verge” of informing everyone about their existence. He said the Galactic Federation, however, reportedly stopped him from doing so, saying they wished to prevent mass hysteria since they felt humanity needed to “evolve and reach a stage where we will… understand what space and spaceships are,” Yediot Aharonot reported. Speaking on why he chose to reveal this information now, he said, “If I had come up with what I’m saying today five years ago, I would have been hospitalised. “Today, they’re already talking differently. “I have nothing to lose. I’ve received my degrees and awards. “I am respected in universities abroad, where the trend is also changing,” he added. (ANI/NAN)
