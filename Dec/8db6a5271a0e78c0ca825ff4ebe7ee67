 Leicester City Coach Brendan Rodgers has described the Nigeria  International Wilfred Ndidi as one of the best defensive midfielders in the English Premier League (EPL) as well as in Europe. Excited about the return of Ndidi to the Foxes’ first team action since he suffered a groin injury against Burnley in September which side-lined him for eight weeks, Rogers stated matter-of-factly: “To miss that power and speed in our backline, it was difficult for us, even though we’ve done so well. Ndidi is one of the best defensive midfield players in the Premier League and in Europe.” “To have those boys available again and working their way back to fitness, I’m excited for their return and, obviously, for them to come back into the squad.” Nonetheless, the City manager is thrilled to welcome players of their quality back into the matchday squad as his talented side looks to build on an encouraging start to the 2020/21 campaign. However, Ndidi who missed Super Eagles AFCON 2022 Qualifiers against Sierra Leone is indeed excited to be back in action. Ndidi in a video posted by Leicester on Twitter alongside his teammate Ricardo Pereira said: “Hi guys, it’s Wilfred Ndidi and we are happy to be back and hopefully things go well.”
