 OYO State Government has explained the rationale behind its decision to begin a three-day capacity building for stakeholders on Female Genital Mutilation (FGM). It said the essence is to sensitise people against the practice of FGM as a way of ensuring its stoppage across the nooks and crannies of the state. The workshop is being organised by the government in collaboration with Hacey Health Initiative. Speaking about the opening of the workshop held at SDM Tavern Event Centre, Agodi, Ibadan, the Executive Secretary, Oyo State Primary Health Care Board, Dr. Muideen Olatunji, said the workshop was aimed at increasing the knowledge of members of Ministries, Departments and Agencies on understanding relevant government policies against the practice of FGM, while also advocating against the practice. He said: “What we are seeing here today involves many other stakeholders, and in life, you cannot give what you don’t have. So, if you are not well informed, there is no way you can do the cycle of the campaign against female genital mutilation. “This is like the first step towards reaching out to many other people to key into the campaign and help reverse the trend of female genital mutilation.”
