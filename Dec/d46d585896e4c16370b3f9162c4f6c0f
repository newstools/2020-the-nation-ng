Juventus are exploring ways of securing a deal for Pogba after his agent, Mino Raiola, declared the midfielder “needs a new club” in an interview earlier this week Juventus would reportedly consider a swap deal which would see Paul Pogba return to Turin and Cristiano Ronaldo rejoin Manchester United. Pogba, 27, is destined to leave Old Trafford after his agent, Mino Raiola, claimed the midfielder “needs a new club” and is “unhappy” at United earlier this week. While Real Madrid are heavily linked with the France international, Raiola appeared to hint Juventus are leading the race to sign his client. Pogba enjoyed a sublime four-season spell with Juve before his £89million transfer to the Red Devils in 2016, scoring 34 goals and winning six major honours with the Old Lady. Juventus remain keen on their former player and are “not against” a swap deal which would see Portugal superstar Ronaldo move in the other direction, according to The Independent . The report adds Juve would reluctantly part ways with Ronaldo, 35, in order to free up funds for a much-needed rebuild of Andrea Pirlo’s squad. Meanwhile, United are also open to the swap deal and executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward continues to keep tabs on the club’s former star. While Pogba has faltered for the Red Devils this season, Ronaldo has been in typically prolific form and has scored 12 goals in 10 games in all competitions. The forward has won back-to-back Serie A titles since joining Juventus in 2018 and scored twice as the club secured top spot in Champions League Group G with a 3-0 victory at Barcelona on Tuesday
