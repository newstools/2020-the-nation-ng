Factional  Chairman of the Delta State Football Association, Edema Fuludu, has said that he was waiting of a further action by the Federation of International Football over the current imbroglio that has enveloped football in the state. FIFA, only recently wrote a letter to the NFF over the Delta FA elections won by Edema Fuludu as Chairman and Victor Ikpeba as Vice chairman respectively. The world football body demanded for answers over alleged interference from Abuja on the affairs of the body in Asaba. “They kept that letter and I learnt they are trying to reply secretly,” a source said. The Delta FA sent two separate letters with documents on NFF’s Statutes, Delta FA Statutes and State FA laws. It would be recalled that the NFF earlier in the year set up a normalization committee which conducted an election that brought in another factional chairman, Kenneth Nwaomucha. Fuludu also told newsmen that he had written the NFF to send the FIFA palliatives, which is a COVID-19 relief grant, to his team and no other person.  “What they are doing all along are attempts to legalise illegalities. The palliatives should come to us and not an illegal body,” Fuludu said.
