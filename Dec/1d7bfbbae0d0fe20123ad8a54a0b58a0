 THE Economic and Financial Crimes Commission EFCC has accused a Lagos-based businessman, Kelechi Mbagwu, of obtaining N25 million under false pretence. Mbagwu and his company, CMB Building Maintenance and Investment Ltd, were arraigned last Friday on three counts before a Lagos Special offences court in Ikeja. Prosecution lawyer Abdullahi Mohammed told Justice Sherifat Solebo that the defendant obtained the money by false pretence.  He alleged that the defendants committed the offence in Lagos, between February 12 and September 14, 2018. The court heard that Kelechi and his firm obtained the money from Okafor Ameachi Sixtus by falsely representing to him that the two residential plots of land in Pearl Garden Estate, Sangotedo, Lagos he gave to him was genuine. The defendants pleaded not guilty. The prosecutor prayed the court to remand the first defendant in EFCC custody, on the ground that he had about 13 different cases involving up to N2.3 billion. Defence lawyer R.A Aladesonmi told the court of his intention to file a motion for bail, because the offence for which the defendants were charged ‘is bailable’. Justice Solebo remanded Mbagwu in the EFCC’s custody pending any application for bail. She then adjourned till February 2, 2021 for trial.
