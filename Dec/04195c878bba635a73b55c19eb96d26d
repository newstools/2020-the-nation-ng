The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has told the Federal High Court in Lagos how Uyiekpen Giwa-Osagie, a lawyer to a former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar, allegedly laundered $2 million. Its investigator, Shuaibu Shehu, told Justice Chukwujekwu Aneke that Giwa-Osagie received instruction from the former Vice-President to give the $2 million to one of Atiku’s security guards. Giwa-Osagie is standing trial alongside his brother, Erhunse Giwa-Osagie, on a three-count charge of money laundering to the tune of $2 million the EFCC filed against them. At Monday’s sitting, Shehu, who was led in evidence by prosecution counsel, Kufre Uduak, said the EFCC, sometime in 2019, received intelligence that some politicians were moving around with the United States (U.S) dollars to influence the result of the last general elections. He said: “It was also revealed that $1.6 million was given to Alhaji Lawan Abdullahi, a Bureau De Change (BDC) operator. “Based on this intelligence, my team conducted investigations and recovered the $1.459 million in cash. “It was also discovered that the money came from a company called Guensey Trust Nigeria Limited controlled by the first defendant (Giwa-Osagie) in trust for Atiku Abubakar,” Shehu said. The witness said Guensey Trust received into its account 26 million Euros from a foreign company, Intel West Africa. “The money was then converted into dollars, which was $30 million. “Guensey Trust transferred the $5 million into Andrew Pitchford, a company owned by the second defendant, and was converted into naira through a BDC company. “The second defendant was also instructed by the first defendant to raise $2 million for someone, whom we later found out to be a security guard to Atiku Abubakar,” he said.
