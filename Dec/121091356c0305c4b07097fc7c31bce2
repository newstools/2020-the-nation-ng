According to him: “There is every need to diversify the state’s economy to agriculture and in view of this our governor has done a lot in driving the agricultural sector to a greater height so that the potentials that abound in the sector can be tapped to generate revenue, create jobs and provide livelihood to the citizens. “Governor Bello has consistently lashed on to most of the Federal Government, CBN and World Bank assisted projects to ensure that beyond what the state is doing through the ministry of agriculture, other projects like the APPEALS project can benefit Kogi farmers.” While commending the APPEALS project for assisting Kogi State farmers with inputs and grants, the Deputy Governor  called on other state governors to take the issue of security seriously to prevent senseless killing of farmers by terrorists in their farm centres.
