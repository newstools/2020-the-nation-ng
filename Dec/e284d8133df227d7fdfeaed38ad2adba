 The Ekiti State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has suspended a member, Badejo Anifowose, over alleged involvement in anti-party activities and gross misconduct. The party, in a statement by the factional Public Secretary, Raphael Adeyanju, said Anifowose was suspended for accepting the position of Chairman, Ekiti Environmental Protection Agency, from Governor  Kayode Fayemi, against the party’s advice. Adeyanju said the suspension was given by the party’s State Working Committee, at an emergency meeting presided over by the Chairman, Bisi Kolawole, following the recommendation from PDP executives in his Ikun Ward 01, in Moba Local Government.  He said the party leadership of his ward set up a three-man committee chaired by Agbede Sunday, with Afolabi Nike as the Secretary and Owoeye as member, to investigate allegations against Anifowose, but he refused to honour the invitation. But, Anifowose described the suspension as null and void, saying: “All I have to say is that I am not accountable to their faction in the party. The party has two factions in Ekiti and the case is still court. So, they are not in a position to suspend me. They have not right.”
