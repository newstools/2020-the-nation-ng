 THE General Overseer, Power and Wisdom of God Church, Badagry, Lagos State, Pastor Idowu Ayadi, has said efforts by the government to fix the country may not achieve results unless Nigerians contribute to the nation’s development. He spoke in Badagry at the weekend during a celebration to mark Christmas. Ayadi attributed most of the problems facing the country to the “spirit of cheating”. Speaking about a message titled: ‘The Spirit Troubling the Nigerian Nation’, the cleric said: “Efforts by the government to improve our roads and power supply have not yielded the desired results, because of the spirit of cheating in people who are frustrating the efforts. “Infrastructural decay is the major contributor to our economic problems. “There will not be economic prosperity in any nation where there is no efficient infrastructure to support the production of goods and services.” He said the spirit of cheating made the perpetrators of insecurity believe that what they could not get legally might be got through cruel and dubious means. “We should not pass the total blame of insecurity in our society on the current administration alone. “It is the effect of the long term accumulated failures of some of our leaders, who the spirit of cheating has deceived to believe that as long as they and their families are comfortable, what happens to others is not their concern,” Ayadi said. He urged the government to set aside an hour once in a week to pray with Psalm 124:1-8 for security of the country.
