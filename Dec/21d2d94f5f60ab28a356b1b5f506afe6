U.S. President Donald Trump called the speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives twice asking for assistance in revising his election loss in the state, media reported. According to The Washington Post, the office of House Speaker Bryan Cutler confirmed these calls. Pennsylvania is the third state after Georgia and Michigan, where Trump directly attempted to overturn the election results, the outlet noted. Cutler reportedly told Trump that the stateâ€™s legislative authorities were not authorised to change the composition of the Electoral College selected by voting. The winner of the U.S. presidential election, held on Nov. 3, is yet to be officially declared, but all major U.S. media outlets have named Democrat Joe Biden the winner. Earlier, Trump announced that he had instructed his team to start the transition process, but still promised to continue his attempts to dispute the validity of the vote. (Sputnik/NAN)
