 An electrician, Bright Odi (33), has died after he was allegedly kicked on the scrotum by Victor Iwu at Umueje Obinze, Owerri West Local Government Area of Imo State. Iwu and Odi were allegedly quarrelling on how to share the bride price of their sister who got married on Sunday. It was gathered that the victim fell and started writhing in pains after the kick. He was rushed to the hospital where he died the following day. Angry youths yesterday besieged Iwu’s family home and set it ablaze when they didn’t meet him there. Interim Chairman of Owerri West, Okechukwu Enyioha, said he has called security agencies to take over the matter. Police spokesman Orlando Ikeokwu said the Commissioner of Police, Isaac Akinmoyede, has ordered that the case be transferred to the State Criminal and Intelligence Department for investigation.
