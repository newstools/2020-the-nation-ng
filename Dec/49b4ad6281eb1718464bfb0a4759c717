An Ikeja Special Offences Court on Monday remanded two businessmen – Osita Ojeah and Anthony Nosy – in custody for the alleged theft of N100 million. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) arraigned the two for allegedly stealing N100 million from Virgin Forest Energy Limited. The defendants were arraigned on a two-count charge with their company, Homeland Overseas Limited, before Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo. EFCC lawyer Nkereum Ananah said the defendants on February 3, 2016, dishonestly converted the said sum to personal use. The defendants pleaded not guilty. Their lawyers, Henry Ifieawe and C.H. Nwuk, urged the court to grant them bail on a liberal term. They said bail application has been filed and copies served on the prosecutor. But Ananah opposed the bail, saying the commission would be responding to that effect. Justice Taiwo ordered the defendants to be remanded in EFCC custody pending the determination of their bail application. She then adjourned till December 4 to rule on their bail application.
