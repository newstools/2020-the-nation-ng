The Ijaw Youth Council (IYC) has rebutted calls by its president urging President Muhammadu Buhari to sack the Interim Management Committee (IMC) of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). IYC President Timothy Igbifa, on Tuesday, demanded for the sack of the Prof. Daniel Pondei-led IMC board. He said what the people  need is a substantive board. Igbifa also accused the IMC of not being in touch with the people, saying there is a big disconnect between the board and the people. But a statement by IYC Secretary, Ebilade Ekerefe, debunked Igbifa’s stance as personal and not representing Ijaw youths. Ekerefe noted that the position of Ijaw youths is reflected in the recent seven-point demand presented by the Southsouth Governors during the last stakeholders meeting held in Port Harcourt, Rivers State. According to him, sponsors of the purported report should urge President Buhari to focus on increasing funding for the NDDC instead of calling for sack of the Pondei-led committee. The statement reads: “Sponsors of the report should rather intensify calls on President Buhari to pay all outstanding allocation owed the NDDC. The president should also increase funding to the commission to meet the region’s development needs. The Act establishing the NDDC should also be amended to include a ‘deterrent clause’ to multinationals which have refused to pay their obligatory three per cent contribution to the NDDC to quicken development in the region. “It’s sad and unacceptable that the IOCs’ will continue to treat the region with contempt and impunity because the laws allow them to do so. NDDC has become a cash cow for politicians and too much interference is the real problem facing the commission. This has contributed to the agency not being able to meet the people’s expectation.”
