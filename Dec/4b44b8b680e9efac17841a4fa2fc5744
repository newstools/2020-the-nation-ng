Lassa fever has killed 80 people in Ondo State in the last one year. Health Commissioner Dr. Jibayo Adeyeye disclosed this on Thursday during a road walk sensitisation on the eradication of Lassa fever. He said the disease killed more people in the state than the dreaded COVID-19 pandemic this year. Adeyeye said the only way Lassa fever can be eradicated is when rodents are wiped off from communities. He said 10,000 rodenticides were distributed free to the residents to exterminate rodents.
