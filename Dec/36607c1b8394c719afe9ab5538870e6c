NIGERIA international Alex Iwobi delivered an impressive performance to help Everton avoid defeat at Burnley. Iwobi shone as Everton played out a 1-1 draw in Saturdayâ€™s Premier League game. The 24-year-old was handed his fourth league start and delivered an eye-catching performance in the encounter. The versatile forward starred in a wing-back role, pairing Michael Keane, Ben Godfrey and Yerry Mina in defence. The Nigeria international hit the ground running in the encounter and came close to helping the Toffees open the scoring as early as the second minute. Iwobi attempted to send in a dangerous cross but was blocked before Burnley capitalized on a defensive blunder from Allan to score the first goal of the game. Robert Brady beat goalkeeper Jordan Pickford after receiving a sumptuous assist from Ashley Westwood to put his side in front in the third minute of the game. Everton, however, levelled proceedings shortly before the half-time break through Dominic Calvert-Lewin after he was set up by Richarlison. The Super Eagles forward had 86 touches on the ball, made 57 passes and completed two key passes in the game. He made seven crosses to ensure the Toffees avoided their second consecutive defeat.
