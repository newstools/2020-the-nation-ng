 A MIDDLE-AGED man was on Sunday crushed by a truck on the Owerri road in Onitsha, Anambra State. The deceased was reportedly crossing the busy expressway when he was knocked down by the truck driver who drove against traffic. Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) Andrew Kumapayi confirmed the incident. He said the body had been deposited at the mortuary. He said: “About 11:40hrs today (yesterday), a middle age man was crushed by a truck driver near Owerri road, by City biscuit junction, Onitsha. “According to eyewitnesses, the truck driver took one way and crushed the man who alighted from a tricycle. “Three men were involved in the accident, including the victim who was rushed to Toronto Hospital by policemen before the FRSC rescue team from Upper Iweka Outpost arrived at the scene.” Kumapayi, who condoled with the bereaved family, warned motorists to desist from route violation (one way driving) as the Corps will prosecute offenders. He also urged pedestrians to use pedestrian bridges where available and observe traffic drills before crossing the road.
