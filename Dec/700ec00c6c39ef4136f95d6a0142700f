A Chinese Kuang Zhang, and Abdulhadi Musa, have reportedly died in the crisis that broke out at a mining site in Ido-Oko, Obokun Local Government Area of Osun State. The Nation gathered that the incident happened about 4:30pm on Tuesday after some Chinese nationals arrived at the mining site where some miners were working. The Chinese team arrived at the site in the company of security officers, and directed the workers to vacate immediately. They claimed the site had been licensed to them by the Federal and state governments, but the workers refused to leave, claiming they owned it. The altercation snowballed into a crisis leading to the death of Zhang and Musa. It was learnt that another Chinese was beaten to a coma while another miner sustained bullet wounds. A source said policemen, led by the Divisional Police Officer (DPO), stormed the site to restore peace. He said:  “The swiftness of the policemen prevented a lot of deaths. One Hausa and a Chinese were killed. The scenario was terrible because other people sustained injuries. Police spokesman Mrs. Yemisi Opalola confirmed the incident. She said: “Our men were deployed in the scene. Kuang Zhang and Abdulhadi Musa died and their bodies have been deposited in Wesley Guild Hospital morgue, Ilesha. “The Chinese that was beaten to a coma and the injured miner are responding to treatment at Wesley Guild Hospital, Ilesha. The matter is still under investigation.”
