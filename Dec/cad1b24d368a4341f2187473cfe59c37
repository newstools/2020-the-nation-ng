Ujoatuonu, in a statement, said the ‘no objection’ nod will enable the company support farmers and service providers in the agricultural value chain for greater sustainability and economic growth. He listed products approved for the firm as Fishery Agricultural Insurance Plan and Poultry Agricultural insurance plan. He noted that poultry policy covers the death of the poultry animals, resulting from accident or disease while the fishery policy covers loss of fish caused by death and cost of reconstruction of fish pond in the event of collapse. According to him, the agribusiness sector needs insurance to remain sustainable and achieve long term growth expectation. He stated that stakeholders in the agricultural value chain must embrace insurance if they want to reduce retained risk by transferring the burden to insurers for effective risk management.
