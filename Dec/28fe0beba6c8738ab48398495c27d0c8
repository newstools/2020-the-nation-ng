 Despite losing 91-68 to Nigeria’s D’Tigers in the first window of the 2021 FIBA AfroBasket Qualifiers, Mali’s point guard Mahamadou Kante believes they are poised to turn the tide against the Mike Brown-tutored side when the second window of the qualifiers opens on February 2021. Kante, who is a three-time AfroBasket participant, however admitted that Mali faced some tough times during the First Round of Group D of the AfroBasket Qualifiers in Kigali where they faced Nigeria, Rwanda and South Sudan. With only one win from three matches played so far, Kante feels they need to be more efficient if they want to visit the Kigali Arena again next year. “We missed some collective play and preparation,” he says, talking to FIBA.basketball.  “We need to remain focused on our goal, which is to qualify for the Final Round,” he insisted. Last month, they managed to secure their only win in their opening game against hosts Rwanda, closing the deal with a 70-64 victory. But they faced an ultra-competitive Nigeria and a surprising South Sudan side, suffering two defeats in a row. “Clearly, we came for something better than this. But we must say that we were caught unaware by South Sudan, who displayed discipline and physical abilities,” he said. And revenge is on the mind of Kante as Mali is determined to advance to the Final Round. And for Mali to be there, they need to secure victories over Nigeria and South Sudan at the least. “(The February Qualifying window) it is crucial for us now. And it hurts a bit when we realize that we could have won our games, had we been better prepared,” said Kante.  Despite the tough times Mali has lived through in Kigali, they remain confident about their qualification chances.
