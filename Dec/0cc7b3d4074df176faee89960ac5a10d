The Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF) has called on the National Assembly for a review of its law to compel recalcitrant employers to register their employees under it.  It said it was aware that some employers under report their staff strength so as not to pay the right employee’s gross emolument and thus prevent it from delivering on its mandate. Acting Managing Director/ Chief Executive Officer, NSITF, Dr. Kelly Nwagha, said this at the NSITF day at the just concluded 2020 Lagos International Trade Fair. Nwagha, represented by the acting Executive Director, Operations, Arc. Kabir Baba Ma’aji, said the body has paid over N905m as employee compensation to 13,000 claimants between January to November 2020. The claimants – employers and employees- were indemnified under its various claims divisions – Medical Expenses Refund (MER) to an employer, Loss of Productivity to the employer, disability beneficiaries, and death benefits to next of kin/beneficiaries. Ma’aji said it would continue to enlighten more organisations on the importance of registering their employees under it and contributing to its pool of funds. He said this is another way to get employee loyalty when they know that there is a claim for them in case of an accident, loss of productivity, injuries, or death. Adedeji Adegoke, Acting Regional Manager, Lagos, NSITF, said since inception, it has position itself to be the leading social security institution in Africa, setting the agenda for change, social policy, economic empowerment, and poverty alleviation in Nigeria. Adegoke said aside from paying claims, the agency has undertaken various campaigns across different sectors to prevent occupational accidents and diseases through occupational safety and health enlightenment. He said this became important due to the novel coronavirus pandemic.
