A yet-to-be identified businessman has reportedly been kidnapped by unknown gunmen in Aba, the commercial nerve of Abia State. Though details of the kidnapping incident is still sketchy at the time of filing the report, sources within the Ogbor Hill axis of the commercial city told our correspondent that the kidnappers whisked away their victim to unknown destination after they took him away. The kidnappers were yet to establish contact with the victimâ€™s family, according to sources who spoke anonymously with our reporter. This is as reports that emerged on Sunday have it that another businessman (Mr. Obinna) who was kidnapped last two weeks Thursday regained freedom in the early hours of Sunday. It was gathered that the kidnappers who had demanded N200m on Thursday reduced their demand to N100m. The family were said to have insisted that they could not afford the said amount. When their demands could not be met, the gang reportedly collected N5m that was delivered to them at a particular location before releasing the victim. No member of the family could be reached for comments, but a source told our correspondent that they were asked not to involve any security agents or risk losing the victim who owns a popular fast food facility on the Aba axis of the ever-busy Enugu-Port Harcourt expressway.
