 THE Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) in Makurdi, Benue State, has arraigned Monday Segun for alleged bank account fraud, obtaining money by false pretence, conspiracy and online scam. Segun landed in trouble, following a petition that he and others at large were defrauding people using different online tricks. The suspect said he would usually open accounts with several banks, using different names, which he would then sell with the ATM card to other fraudsters. He has sold five of such accounts at N25,000 each. His ‘not guilty’ plea prompted prosecution lawyer, Mary Onoja, to ask the court for a trial date and to remand him in correctional centre pending his trial. The defence lawyer made an oral application for his bail. Justice Mobolaji Olajuwon admitted the accused to a bail of N500,000 with two sureties in like sum. If employed, the surety must present a letter of employment, showing current grade level and last promotion, and if self-employed, must show evidence of three years tax payment. The surety must also submit two recent passport photographs, residential and office address, which must be verified by the court and confirmed by the EFCC. Justice Olajuwon adjourned the case till tomorrow and ordered the suspect to be remanded in correctional centre pending the perfection of his bail conditions.
