A consumer advocacy group, the Association of Telephone, Cable TV and Internet Subscribers of Nigeria (ATCIS) on Monday urged the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Pantami, to prevail on telcos and pay Tv service providers to offer quality services at affordable prices. A statement signed by its National President, ‘Sina Bilesanmi, commended Dr Pantami for slashing data cost by 50 per cent but said this has not been reflected in what end users get from the telcos. The group had earlier threatened to stage a protest against high data prices and poor quality of services offered by network operators in the country. He said Nigerians were paying for inefficiency occasioned by poor facilities that make smooth communications almost impossible. “Despite this, our people are charged for dropped calls, paying for services not enjoyed. In the case of cable subscriptions, it is curious why it has not been possible to bill subscribers on pay-as-you-view basis,”Bilesanmi said. Commenting on the ministerial directive on data cost, he said: “We commend the move by the government to reduce the price of data as we have been advocating for this since last year. On December 24, 2019, the ATCIS, led by its national president, staged a protest against the high price of data. Now, the Federal Government has heeded our plea. The association therefore thanks the government for supporting subscribers’ cry by slashing data price by 50 per cent. We sincerely hope to start seeing the reduction in practice and not in print.” The Federal Government had said data cost had been reduced by more than 50 per cent following a directive to that effect to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC).
