Governors are to meet Wednesday to examine new measures for addressing the nation’s security challenges. Spokesman of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF), Abdulrazaque Bello-Barkindo, stated this while announcing the agenda of the 22nd NGF teleconference meeting to be held tomorrow. Bello-Barkindo said the 36 governors would be “seeking to evolve a new national security order that will ensure safety of lives and property nationwide”. He added: “As part of the effort, beginning at the sub-national level, the forum will be receiving zonal updates on SARS and internal security at its Wednesday meeting. “Similarly, the forum will also revisit the issue of CACOVID palliatives with updates on its current status in all the states. “Three groups will be making presentations, top of which will be a joint effort between the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, and Kaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai, discussing how to access Pension Funds for Infrastructure Development in the country.”
