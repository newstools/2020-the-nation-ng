 THE Federal Government has advised Nigerians against self-medication for COVID-19, saying it could lead to body organs damage. Director of Hospital Services, Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) Dr. Adebimpe Adebiyi gave the advice on Wednesday in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja. Articles about various home remedies and ways to prevent COVID-19 have been circulating on social and conventional media since the onset of coronavirus pandemic. Theories such as gargling hot saltwater, drinking lots of water and taking various vitamins and antibiotics are a few that are believed to cure the disease. Adebiyi emphasized that while there might be some “rationale” behind these theories, they could, however, pose serious dangers to the body and cause health complications. “Be careful what you read on social media and send to your friends and loved ones. There are all sorts of inaccurate information out there. “The best thing we can do is maintain our good health habits, eat healthy diets and do lots of exercises when we can. Practice social distancing, maintain top hand hygiene and stay home, unless you need to go out for essential activities,” she advised. The director noted that one of the most dangerous prevention methods circulating on social media was the abuse of hydroxychloroquine, believed to be a cure for COVID-19. According to Adebiyi, taking certain drugs without medical prescription and supervision can result in body toxicity and consequently lead to sedation, coma, seizures, heart complications and other conditions. “Do not take any drugs outside of a physician’s recommendation please. At this moment, the best we can do to stay alive is to take medications that have been hypothesised as helpful. “People with underlying conditions can safely take drugs when prescribed, but we need a better understanding of the risks and benefits of taking medication to treat COVID-19.”
