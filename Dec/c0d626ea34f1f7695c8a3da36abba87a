A pension fund administrator, Oak Pensions, has upgraded its App following customer complaints. The new App was built and will be managed by an in-house team. The management said the new app comes with an easy-to-navigate dashboard that shows each customer’s profile details, total contributions to date, details of last contribution and quarterly statement at a glance. It also allows users to track benefit updates and features easier and faster ways to chat with customer care. It shows the location of all Oak Pensions’ branches in the country, information about pension and the pension industry, and will feature regular newsletters to keep customers abreast. When launched, customers are directed to update their app through Play Store (for Android users) and IOS Store (for Apple users). “With the newly upgraded app, customers will carry a customised self-service tool that solves most of the challenges usually experienced with managing their pension funds. “This will reduce the stress and time involved physically contacting the pension managers,” the firm said.
