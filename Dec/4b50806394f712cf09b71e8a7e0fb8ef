 THE Edo State has recorded two deaths and 18 new coronavirus cases, bringing the total number of active cases in the state to 90. In a tweet, Governor Godwin Obaseki urged residents to take personal responsibility to protect themselves and their loves so as to prevent the spread of the virus. According to him, “We recorded two deaths and 18 new COVID-19 cases, bringing the total number of active cases in the state to 90. As we combat the second wave of the pandemic, I urge you to take personal responsibility to protect yourself and your loved ones this season. Stay safe.” The governor had earlier said the state government had reactivated isolation and treatment centres across the state, adding that the state’s contact tracing network and disease surveillance mechanism has been reinvigorated to deal with new cases in the state. He said: “We now have in place a robust disease surveillance system in the state with well-trained contact tracers, who can undertake active case searches; we have 4 PCR molecular laboratories that can undertake large numbers of tests with procedures to promptly obtain results from the laboratories. “Our case management system is intact to provide care for confirmed cases. We also have 4 well-equipped, functional isolation centres spread across the state.”
