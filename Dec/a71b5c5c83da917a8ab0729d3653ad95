 MULTITALENTED and Award-winning rapper, Falz has said that he was inspired by Popular American actor, producer and rapper, Will Smith. He made this known in a recent Instagram live interview when asked who inspired his type of talent in Africa or internationally. “Within Africa,  I cant really think of anyone, but outside Africa, I’ll say maybe Will Smith you know, that is someone that I kind off looked at and looked up too and I said okay this guy is kind of multifaceted and with his sort of life and everything as well so yeah he is probably the closest to it”, said Falz. On how he held strong during the unusual pandemic year and what changes it made for him, he said “The pandemic has been rough, the roughest year by far, so many things have happened, we have lost so many heroes, we have lost so many warriors, but I think it definitely changed a lot, it changed my perspective, it changed my mindset in the sense that I started to see that what we, when I say we I mean we artist and performing act saw as a big stream of income this year was completely cut out, there was a big learning curve and that is me seeing that we have to keep as many streams open as possible because if you only rely on that anything can happen at anytime you know so for me one thing I had always wanted to do was to start a production company, film and television production company so this year was the perfect opportunity, we started that, we put out our first show called `Therapy’ featuring myself, Toke Makinwa and Bovi on Youtube, at the end of the day that was our first project, then and our first ever movie at the box office is in the cinemas right now “Quam’s money’ it is  a collaboration we have co executive producers though now I could proudly say my production house, House 21 has gone on to work on two major projects now”, said Falz.
