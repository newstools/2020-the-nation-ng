 GENERAL Manager of Lagos State Office of Disability Affairs (LASODA), Mr Oluwadamilare Ogundairo,  has promised to create a digital data bank for persons living with disability  to ensure socio-economic inclusion for the disabled in the state. Ogundairo said this at the unveiling of the ‘Preliminary Findings of Our Lagos, Our Disability Report 2020: an Assessment of Compliance by Public and Private Institutions on Lagos State Disability Law orgranised by Centre for Citizens with Disabilities with support from Ford Foundation. The event brought together government representatives from the Ministry of Justice, Youth and Sports, civil society groups, and clusters groups of persons living with disability. He said the database for Lagosians living with disabilities is expected to provide a framework for addressing the numerous challenges they face and elicit quick response to their needs. He noted that the data base will be flexible for members of PLWD, who will put in their details with their phones, email and register on our website as members of the PLWD community. He said, “It is the interest of the government to make life better for everyone. We will ensure the law is enforced and implemented and persons with disabilities get the full dividend of the law.”
