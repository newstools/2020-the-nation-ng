 Nigerian equities took a breather yesterday as investors sought to lock in and monetise capital gains. Profit-taking transactions across the market overwhelmed demand and pushed the market to a net loss of N42 billion. Benchmark indices at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) showed average decline of 0.26 per cent yesterday, equivalent to net capital loss of N42 billion. This moderated the average year-to-date return to 30.6 per cent. The negative overall market position was largely due to losses suffered by large-cap stocks such as Nigerian Breweries, Guaranty Trust Bank and Flour Mills of Nigeria. With 19 advancers to 22 decliners, the underlining positive sentiment remained strong and many analysts expected the profit-taking to be a momentary slope in the pricing curve. The All Share Index (ASI)- the value-based common index that tracks all share prices at the Exchange declined from its opening index of 35,147.62 points to close at 35,056.82 points.  Aggregate market value of all quoted equities also dropped correspondingly from its opening value of N18.365 trillion to close at N18.323 trillion. With the losses suffered by large-cap stocks, most sectoral indices closed negative. The NSE Consumer Goods Index dropped by 1.8 per cent. The NSE Banking Index declined by 0.8 per cent. The NSE Oil & Gas Index depreciated by 0.7 per cent while the NSE Industrial Goods Index slipped by 0.02 per cent. Meanwhile, the NSE Insurance Index was the lone gainer with 0.3 per cent.
