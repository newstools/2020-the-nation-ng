Analysts at Cordros Securities said investors were on “continued profit-taking”, noting that the equities market also reacted negatively to the uptick in short-term yields at the Nigerian Treasury Bill (NTB) primary auction. “We expect the profit-taking and negative reaction to the unanticipated front-end supply from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to be short-lived. Yields in the fixed income market remain relatively unattractive, and we expect this to remain positive for stocks. However, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro environment remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings,” Cordros Securities stated. Analysts at Afrinvest Securities said they expected the profit-taking to continue in the next few days. “In the coming week, we anticipate that investors will partake in profit-taking activities,” Afrinvest Securities stated in a weekend note.
