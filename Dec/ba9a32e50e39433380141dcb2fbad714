Anthony Joshua insists he is prepared to forego the huge sums of money that would accompany a fight abroad with Tyson Fury, to ensure it happens on UK soil. The British pair, who hold all five world heavyweight titles between them, look set to finally face each other in the ring in 2021. With the world of boxing reeling along with other sports from the economic impact of the coronavirus, it would be tempting to accept a massive purse from the likes of Saudi Arabia. Indeed, Joshua has revealed that he has been forced to take a pay cut for his upcoming bout with Kubrat Pulev at the O2 Arena, where the lack of a full stadium has seen him forfeit £8million. However, Joshua insists that, should he come through his fight with the Bulgarian, he would intend to stay in the UK to take on the Gypsy King. “Yeah, why not? Now I’m fighting Kubrat Pulev for a massive pay cut,” he replied when asked about fighting Fury in the UK – in the Sun.  “We have to keep the sport alive, Matchroom are taking pay cuts this year, we have to keep the sport alive. “We are all doing our part at the minute, It’s all experience. We are doing it now so I wouldn’t mind doing it again. “It’s not harming me, and it’s for a bigger cause as well, it’s a massive cause and a big fight but the main objective is how do we get Fury in the ring,” he said. Meanwhile, Joshua is taking over Sky Sports Mix, which becomes Sky Sports AJ ahead of his world heavyweight title fight against Kubrat Pulev. Joshua defends his WBA, IBF and WBO belts against Pulev at The SSE Arena, Wembley on December 12, live on Sky Sports Box Office. But before the first bell rings, there is a week dedicated to Joshua, with back-to-back programming about his rise to world heavyweight title glory, which begins next Monday as AJ takes over Sky Sports Mix.
