Asisat Oshoala found the back of the net for Barcelona as they earned a massive 9-0 win at home over Santa Teresa in a Spanish Primera Iberdrola encounter at Estadi Johan Cruyff on Saturday. Going into the tie, the Nigeria striker had emerged the only African in the 50-name shortlist for the Uefa Women’s Team of the Year and was hoping to add to her season’s tally of two league goals for Barcelona. Manager Lluis Cortes handed the Super Falcons captain her third appearance as a substitute after she failed to find the net on her fourth start in a 5-1 win against Real Sociedad last month. As expected, the champions started in fine fettle when Jenni Hermoso opened the scoring off a fine assist from Aitana Bonmati after just four minutes of action in the encounter. Six minutes later, Ana Crnogorcevic assisted Lieke Martens to double the lead for Barcelona before Hermoso set up Martens for a third of the match in the 16th minute. In the 25th minute, Crnogorcevic and Martens combined superbly again to score the fourth before Mariona Caldentey teed up Hermoso for her brace and a fifth of the contest three minutes later.
