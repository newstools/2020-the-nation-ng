The Federal High Court in Ikoyi, Lagos State, has ordered the final forfeiture of the N235,451,969.89 traced to the account of a convicted fraudster, Okeke Obinwanne, to the Federal Government. Justice Mohammed Liman, on March 23, ordered the interim forfeiture of the money domiciled in First City Monument Bank (FCMB), following a December 18, 2019 ex parte application by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). In granting the interim order, Justice Liman also ordered the commission to advertise same in any national newspaper for anyone to show cause why the money should not be finally forfeited to the government. Following the publication of the order in a national newspaper, the commission, on June 2, filed a Motion on Notice seeking the final forfeiture of the money to the Federal Government. During the proceedings on November 12, lawyer to the commission, I. Sulaiman, urged the court to grant his prayers for final forfeiture of the money, which is reasonably suspected to be proceeds of unlawful activities. Justice Liman granted the applicantâ€™s prayers and also ordered the final forfeiture of the money to the Federal Government. Okeke, who is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Invictus Group, was arrested in August 2019 in the United States of America (USA) and charged with two counts of computer fraud and wire fraud, to which he pleaded guilty.
