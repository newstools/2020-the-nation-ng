The Akwa Ibom State Government has maintained sealed lips over the death of its first indigenous military administrator, Air Commodore Idongesit Nkanga (rtd). Reliable sources told our correspondent that Nkanga died on Christmas eve due to alleged complications from COVID-19 infection. He was said to have been receiving treatment in one of the isolation centres in the state. Nkanga, who until his death was the President of Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), had served as the Director General of the Divine Mandate Campaign organization which brought Governor Udom Emmanuel to power in 2015 and 2019. But neither the state government nor his family at Ikot Nya, in Nsit Ibom LGA could make a categorical statement on his death. When contacted, the Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Comrade Iniobong Ememobong, told our correspondent that he was no aware of the death of the elder statesman.
