 LAGOS State said it is working to increase Nigeria’s share of the global coconut products valued at $11.5 billion. The market is anticipated to reach $31.1 billion by 2026. Nigeria buys the bulk of its coconuts from Ghana and Ivory Coast, and ranks 19th on the list of producers in the world. The Commissioner for Agriculture, Ms. Abisola Olusanya, who spoke during   the opening of the Christmas edition of the Eko City Farmers’ Market/Farmers’ Appreciation Day in Lagos, said the state has about two million coconut trees with a yearly production of 200 million husked nuts worth about N10 billion. According to her, the state government would encourage the commercialisation of coconut for local and export markets in the seed nuts and seedling production, establishment of plantations, seed gardens for certified nuts, arts and crafts production, coconut oil production, coconut flour and flakes production and copra production among others. She said the state is paying special attention to the crop being the largest producer accounting for 70 per cent  of the national production. With the efforts of the state government and other stakeholders in the coconut value chain, she said  the yield is expected to increase to more than 400,000 metric tonnes annually. She said the state is blessed with a vast Coconut Belt made up of 180 km2 (18,000Ha) Coastal line and about 703.19 Km2 (70.319Ha) on the Islands. According to her, the government  is implementing  a five-year Road Map for agriculture in the state and there is a target to generate one million jobs for the youths.
