  Nigerian International striker Victor Osimhen will sorely miss the first game at the newly christened Diego Armando Maradona Stadium when Napoli entertains Real Sociedad in their Europa League tie. The Gli Azzurri has played at Stadio San Paolo in 1959 but the edifice was renamed last Friday following the death of their former talismanic captain Argentine Diego Maradona who died November 25. Napoli were away to Crotone in the Serie A on Sunday where they won handsomely 4-0 and today will be their  first game  at the renamed  Diego Armando Maradona Stadium sans  Osimhen who is out injured. Meanwhile, Coach Gennaro Gattuso has said he expected Napoli would face a tough Europa League group. A home draw against Real Sociedad tomorrow would be enough for the Partenopei to qualify for the last 32 stage of Europa League. “I expected a tough group,” Gattuso said at a press conference. “Every team is very organized, Rijeka was considered the weakest side but they have created troubles to everyone. AZ and Real Sociedad have competitive teams,” he continued. “I think I have done good things so far. My staff and I are satisfied with the work done. We have a strong team; we are convinced this is the perfect team for how we see football.” Gattuso will be the first Napoli coach at the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium. “There is emotion and responsibility, also for the importance of the match. Diego deserves so much, for everything he did in this city. It is a great honour for me; there will be further pressure for this.”
