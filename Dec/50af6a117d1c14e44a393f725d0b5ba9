 Former Super Eagles captains Mutiu Adepoju and Austin Okocha have applauded the Government of the State of Osun for some of the programmes being embarked upon to turn the state into a Mecca of sports. Adepoju, Okocha as well as other Nigerian internationals including Ike Shorunmu, Friday Ekpo, Yisa Sofoluwe, Bright Omokaro, Duke Udi, Femi Opabunmi and Dele Adeleye were part of a recent novelty match to flag off the construction of a Sports Complex that will accommodate a world class Sports Academy in the State, in conjunction with a private company. Both Adepoju and Okocha praised the public and private sector partnership that will also see to the construction of mini stadia across the state; as well as revival of grassroots Sports programmes like the Governor’s Cup for Secondary Schools with renewed focus on athletics, basketball and handball. The State of Osun and the private company Peculiar Ultimate Concerns Limited are partnering to build the Sports Academy that will have a 5000-6000 capacity stadium, four training pitches for track and field events, with a sitting capacity of 1200, classrooms for students and staff quarters. The arrangement also includes the provision of a 18-hole golf course and a multipurpose sports arena among other top class features. Peculiar Ultimate Concerns Limited will, as added benefits, bankroll the premium grassroots competition in the State, the Governor’s Cup for five years.
