Brazilian legend Pelé wrote an emotional letter to Diego Armando Maradona seven days after the Argentine passed away. ‘I love you, Diego’. The Napoli hero passed away last Wednesday at the age of 60 and messages and letters from the football world have praised and remembered the former Argentina international. Maradona and Pelé, as the latter said in his letter, were compared to each other throughout, in a never-ending battle to crown the greatest footballer in history. Pelé remembers Maradona in a letter posted on social media and these are his touching words. “Today it’s been seven days since you left. Many people loved to compare us all their lives,” Pele wrote on social media. “You were a genius that enchanted the world. A magician with the ball at his feet. A true legend. But above all that, for me, you will always be a great friend, with an even bigger heart. “Today, I know that the world would be much better if we could compare each other less and start admiring each other more. So, I want to say that you are incomparable. “Your trajectory was marked by honesty. And in your unique and particular way, you taught us that we have to love and say ‘I love you’ a lot more often. “Your quick departure didn’t let me say it to you, so I will just write it: I love you, Diego. “My great friend, thank you very much for our entire journey. One day, in heaven, we will play together on the same team. And it will be the first time that I raise my fist in the air in triumph on the pitch without celebrating a goal. “It will be because I can finally embrace you again.”
