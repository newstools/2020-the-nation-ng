Governor Okezie Ikpeazu’s chief of staff, Anthony Agbazuere has been suspended from office. The news of his suspension was contained in a statement made available to newsmen on Sunday afternoon. The statement signed by the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Barr. Chris Ezem, explained that the Permanent Secretary, Government House, Mr. Alozie Odoemelam, has been directed to perform the duties of the office of Chief of Staff until further notice. Though no reason was given for his suspension, unconfirmed reports have it that the suspension of Agbazuere is connected with the recent invitation of a self-acclaimed Prophet, Dr. Chukwuemeka Ohanaemere popularly known as “Odumeje” to the State House. Agbazuere was caught on camera spraying money on the Onitsha based prophet in his office in a video which trended at the weekend.
