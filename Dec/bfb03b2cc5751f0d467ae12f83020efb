The National Association of Nigerian Nurses in North America (NANNNA), on December 22, hosted nurses at the Infectious Disease Hospital (IDH), Yaba, Lagos State, to a surprise breakfast. Prior to the breakfast, NANNNA had donated 5,000 face shields to nurses all over the country to show appreciation, solidarity and support. Members of the National Association of Nigerian Nurses and Midwives (NANNM) thanked their international colleagues for the gesture. The Director of Nursing Services, Ministry of Health, Dorcas Shonibare said: “The fact the NANNNA thought it fit to reach out to us is truly laudable. With Lagos being the epicentre of the pandemic in the country, their aid has being instrumental to helping nurses carrying out their duty. “As caregivers, we have no choice but to help, even when other medical professionals refuse to do so. It is support like this that helps us do the good work we do.” The Director of Nursing Services, Health Service Commission, Olaide Animashaun, said the gesture was NANNNA’s way of recognising the work that nurses in the field do. “The simple fact that an international body is thinking of and supporting the work we do is worthy of applause.” Chief Medical Director of IDH Bowale Abimbola thanked NANNNA for its support and called on the public to follow the example so that healthcare in the country can improve.
