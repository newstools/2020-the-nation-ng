The Federal High Court in Lagos on Friday authorised a former governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose, who is facing an alleged N2.2billion fraud trial, to go on a foreign medical trip. Justice C.J. Aneke made the order following an application by Fayose’s lawyer, Ola Olanipekun (SAN). The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, which is prosecuting Fayose through its counsel, Rotimi Jacobs (SAN), did not oppose the application. The judge adjourned further hearing in the case till January 22, 2021. Fayose is on trial alongside a firm, Spotless Investment Ltd. The EFCC alleged, among others, that Fayose, on June 17, 2014, “took possession of the sum of N1, 219, 000,000 to fund your 2014 gubernatorial campaign in Ekiti State, which you reasonably ought to have known formed part of the proceeds of an unlawful act, to wit: criminal breach of trust/stealing.” The ex-governor was also alleged to have on the same day “received a cash payment of $5,000,000 from Senator Musiliu Obanikoro, the then Minister of State for Defence, which sum exceeded the amount authorised by law and you thereby committed an offence contrary to sections 1 and 16(d) of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act, 2011 (as amended) and punishable under Section 16 (2)(b) of the same Act.” The EFCC also alleged that Fayose purchased a property known as No.44, Osun Crescent, Maitama, Abuja, for N200m in the name of “your elder sister, Mrs Moji Oladeji.” But Fayose and Spotless Investment Limited have pleaded not guilty to the charges.
