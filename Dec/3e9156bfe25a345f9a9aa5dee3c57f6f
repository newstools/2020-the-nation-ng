General Manager, Public Affairs Mrs. Henrietta Yakubu said the tour was part of an effort to assess their infrastructural needs, check their preparation in handling traffic ahead of the Yuletide in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. The FAAN team comprising managing director, Captain Rabiu Yadudu is set to visit the 23 airports in the next 10 days, starting with the Yakubu Gowon Airport Jos, followed by Bauchi Airport, Kaduna Airport, Gombe and Maiduguri Airports before taking another batch of airports.
