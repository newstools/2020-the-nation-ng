 Nigerians have been enjoined to emulate the exemplary lifestyle of the late Chief Gani Fawehunmi, who demonstrated integrity, transparency, and accountability in service delivery. This was contained in an address by Justice Olubunmi Oyewole, a judge of the Court of Appeal, at the Third Annual Gani Fawehinmi Impact and Integrity Awards in Lagos yesterday. Oyewole said the institution of the awards in honour of the late Fawehinmi by Human and Environmental Development Agenda (HEDA) is a demonstration of the resourcefulness of the non-governmental organisation, which is also known as HEDA Resource Centre. He said Nigerians must recognise and demonstrate integrity like the late legal luminary, if they desire what is good and beneficial for the society.  He said Fawehinmi never held public office, “yet he lived a life of service to the Nigerian people; a life permeated by steadfast courage”. He added: “In choosing to honour our Gani with this award, HEDA could not have made a better choice. The late Chief Ganiyu Oyesola Fawehinmi was courage personified. His entire life was permeated by this rare human virtue.” Oyewole said courage is the most important virtue and that to fight corruption, one requires a lot of courage. “It takes courage to choose to be different; it takes immense courage to walk alone on the straight and narrow path,” he said. Quoting from the lecture, Man and His Freewill from the Grail Message, Oyewole said: “It is man’s duty on earth to set himself the highest attainable goal and to strive for this goal with all the powers at his disposal.”
