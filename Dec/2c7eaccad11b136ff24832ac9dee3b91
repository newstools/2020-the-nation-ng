Germany has registered 962 Coronavirus deaths in 24 hours, a new record, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) of infectious diseases in Berlin said on Wednesday. The previous record was reached a week ago, when 952 infections were announced. A further 24,740 new infections were recorded on Wednesday, according to the RKI.  The total number of people who died in connection with a coronavirus infection rose to 27,968 as of on Wednesday. The increasing number of infections and deaths is putting pressure on Germany’s health systems. In the city of Zittau in Germany’s east, the crematorium is completely full and bodies of the deceased are having to be stored in a large storage hall typically in action during floods, the city said on Tuesday.
