Five persons were on Monday feared dead in an accident on the Asaba/Kwale Expressway in Delta State. The accident involved a commercial bus and a car. Many others sustained injuries. An eyewitness, Joshua Nduka, said a Mazda car driving from the Kwale axis collided with a Toyota Hiace bus. He said a diversion on the road due to ongoing construction forced motorists to drive against traffic. Deputy Sector Commander and Head of Operations, Federal Road Safety Corp (FRSC) Bakare Adesina, via a text message, said: “They called me from the call centre in Abuja but I cannot confirm the number of casualties.” Gunmen have reportedly killed the owner of Widisag Hotel Elvis Onojerame (aka Prince Kasuwa), and his friend, in Udu Local Government Area. It was gathered that the incident happened about 2.20pm on Sunday. Details about the incident were not clear as at last night. Police spokesman Onome Onovwakpoyeya confirmed the incident but could not give more information. “It is true there was an assassination and two people were killed,” he added.
