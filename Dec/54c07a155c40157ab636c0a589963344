Former Chairman of Pension Reformed Task Team (PRTT), Abdulrasheed Maina, on Wednesday told the Federal High Court in Abuja that he has no case to answer in the allegations levied against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). Maina, who told Justice Okon Abang after the EFCC, through its counsel, Farouk Abdullah, closed its case, that he would be filing a no-case submission. The former pension reformed boss, through his lawyer, Anayo Adibe, made his intention known after he cross-examined the ninth prosecution witness (PW9), Rouqquaya Ibrahim, an EFCC investigator. Justice Abang adjourned the matter till today for Adibe to address the court orally and for Abdullah to respond to the no-case submission. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Maina (first defendant) was arraigned before Justice Abang on October 25, 2019, by the EFCC alongside his firm, Common Input Property and Investment Limited. Although Maina is facing 12 counts bordering on money laundering of N2 billion, he had pleaded not guilty to all the charges.
