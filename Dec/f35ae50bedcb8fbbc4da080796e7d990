 Everton on Saturday night recorded their third straight victory after beating Arsenal 2-1 at Goddison Park. The Gunners, without the injured Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, have now gone seven league games without a win after Yerry Mina’s header and Rob Holding’s own goal lifted Everton up to second. Rob Holding diverted the ball into his own net after a flick-on from Dominic Calvert-Lewin to put Everton 1-0 up. Nicolas Pepe then scored from the spot for Arsenal after Tom Davies had kicked Ainsley Maitland-Niles in the box. But Everton defender Yerry Mina restored the Toffees’ lead on the stroke of half-time with a header.
