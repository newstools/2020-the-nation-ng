 IMO State has advised artisans, transporters and other business owners to key into the Federal Government’s Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) Survival Fund to empower and grow their businesses. The governor’s Special Adviser on Bureau for the Coordination of Donor/Development Partners Fund, Mrs. Amaka Njoku, spoke yesterday in Owerri at a town hall meeting organised for artisans and transporters. The meeting was tagged ‘MSME Survival Fund: Artisan and Transport Support Scheme Town Hall Meeting’. Njoku regretted that despite the continuous sensitisation by her office, artisans and businessmen had refused to access the fund. She described the fund as a COVID-19 survival initiative under the Federal Ministry of Trade and Industry Payroll Support. She said: “Imo State has been lagging behind when it comes to accessing funds from the Federal Government. To benefit from the MSME Survival Fund, Governor Hope Uzodimma appointed a focal person in my honour. “I, therefore, call on artisans, business owners, companies to remove doubt, fear and biases, and register with the office because there are a lot of advantages. “Artisans should not be afraid to release their BVN. This is a good venture from the Federal Government to cushion the effect of COVID-19 pandemic.” Minister of State for Industry, Trade and Investment Mrs. Mariam Katagum said the town hall meeting was to interact with, and engage the artisans and transporters on the government’s schemes designed to alleviate the effects of COVID-19. Katagum, who was represented by Mr. Ubadigbo Okonkwo, a Member of the Board of Trustees, Nigerian Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (NASME), urged artisans to ensure they benefited from the fund. “The survival fund is a conditional grant of N30,000, “grant not loan”, to 333,000 Nigerians. For Imo State, that is about 9,000 beneficiaries of which 45 per cent of them should be women,” Katagum said.
