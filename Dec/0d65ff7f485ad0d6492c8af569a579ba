Barely five days after an Army Captain, G.S.M. Abubakar, was gruesomely murdered by suspected kidnappers on Lokoja- Okene highway, gunmen have killed two naval officers, a man and a woman, in Kogi State. The incident occurred yesterday about 6pm on Lokoja-Okene highway when the hoodlums shot the duo in their Sienna Toyota van. Police Commissioner Ayuba Ede, who confirmed the incident, said the naval officers were killed on Okene -Lokoja highway. He said he had dispatched operatives to the scene to ascertain details of where the victims were coming from and where they were heading before the incident. It will be recalled that Captain Abubakar was on Sunday killed by suspected kidnappers on the highway, while his mother, wife and children were abducted by the gunmen. Their whereabouts were unknown last night. Abubakar, who was attached to 353 Artillery Ojo Cantonment, Lagos, was going for his official decoration following his new promotion when the incident happened.
