A former President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki has stated reasons why the eighth assembly did not confirm some appointees as nominated by President Muhammadu Buhari. Saraki was the 13th President of the Senate from 2015-2019. He anounced through his official twitter handle @Bukolasaraki, “When we didn’t confirm certain appointees, it was because we did our due diligence. “When we invited the IGP & the security chiefs, it was because we wanted to find solutions to the issues of insecurity at the time.” “It was never about a personal agenda. It was always about Nigeria!” Saraki tweeted. Saraki said the decisions the house took under his leadership were in the best interest of the nation. “The positions we adopted, and the interventions that we embarked on were in the interest of the nation.” he said.
