Juventus star Cristiano Ronaldo insists he intends to play on for ‘many, many years’ and is dreaming of the World Cup with Portugal. The 35-year-old was named Player of the Century at the Globe Soccer Awards on Sunday, having won the Ballon d’Or five times. “It doesn’t matter the age. What is important is the mind,” Ronaldo told reporters. “It doesn’t matter if Cristiano Ronaldo is good, you don’t know tomorrow what is going to happen. I live in the present, in the moment.  “The moment is good, I feel happy, I feel sharp and in a good moment in my life. I hope to play many, many years more but you never know. “This is football, we don’t know what is going to happen tomorrow. When I speak to young boys I always say ‘enjoy the moment’ because we never know what will happen. My eyes see the future very, very bright, so I am happy with that.” He was won practically every trophy at club and international level, except for one. “I still dream of the World Cup with Portugal. It’s possible…” CR7 will be 37 by the time the next World Cup tournament rolls around in Qatar in 2022.
