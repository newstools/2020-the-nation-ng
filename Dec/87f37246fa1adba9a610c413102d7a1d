The House of Representatives on Monday said it will investigate the award of N19.2 billion railway rehabilitation contract to a non-existent company by the Goodluck Jonathan administration in March 2011. The lawmaker resolved to examine the circumstances surrounding the issuance of a certificate of no objection to the Nigeria Railway Corporation (NRC) by the Bureau for Public Procurement (BPE) which the Federal Executive Council (FEC) relied on to award the contract to the company. But it was learnt that the company, Eser Contracting and Industry Company Incorporated, did not meet the requirements for the contract. House Minority Leader Ndudi Elumelu called the attention of his colleagues to the contract. He alleged that Eser Contracting and Industry Company Incorporated was awarded the contract to rehabilitate the 463-kilometre Port Harcourt-Makurdi section of the Eastern railway line for N19.2 billion in March 2011, with the work divided into three sections. According to him, the sections are: the 463-kilometre Port Harcourt-Makurdi track; 1,016-kilometre Makurdi-Kuru track and 640-kilometre Kuru-Maiduguri track.Â  The three sections were awarded to three different companies. Elumelu also alleged that while carrying out due diligence on Eser Contracting and Industry Company Incorporated, it was discovered that the company was no-existent. The lawmaker said it was not duly registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC), as required by the procurement Act; neither did it have the required tax clearance nor audited statement of account for the preceding three years. He added that the company had no legal capacity to do business in Nigeria. Elumelu said in the invitation to bid advert for the contract, which was placed in the November-December 2010 edition of the Federal Tenders Journal, the certificate of incorporation was a major requirement listed among the criteria to bid for the job.
