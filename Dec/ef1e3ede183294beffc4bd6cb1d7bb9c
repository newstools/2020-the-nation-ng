The Lagos State government has urged community leaders in Igbogbo-Baiyeku Local Council Development Area to caution the individuals engaging in trespassing and illegal sand digging activities on the proposed site of LagosHoms Housing Scheme. At a meeting with the community leaders in Alausa, Ikeja, Commissioner for Housing, Mr Moruf Akinderu-Fatai, enjoined host communities to protect government projects. Community members, he said, must collaborate with the government to ensure that the government’s property are not vandalised or encroached upon by unscrupulous individuals. “Government has invested in the well-being of the people by citing some of its housing schemes in Igbogbo to ease the housing deficit in the state. It is sad that this gesture is not reciprocated with an attitude of gratitude from the community,” he said. Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Housing, Mr. Wasiu Akewusola lamented that who perpetrate the untoward actions are known faces in the community. Akewusola enjoined the leaders to caution them to desist as the government would deal with those found culpable. The Odofin of Igbogboland, Chief Tajudeen Onasanya promised to stop illegal dredgers. “Those engaging in dredging activities will now be monitored and those caught engaging in this illegal act will be reported to the appropriate quarters,’ he said’. He also pledged that the community will now take ownership of the government’s properties and ensure its safety. The Director of Commercial Law of the Lagos State Ministry of Justice, Mrs. Kehinde Taiwo, was at the meeting to perfect the agreement of the government with the community leaders and to prepare a memorandum of undertaking using the Encroachment law as a guide. The meeting was witnessed by the representatives from the Ministry of Energy and Resources – Mr. Cardozo Emilio Shorinola and Ms. Agbalaya Toyin.
