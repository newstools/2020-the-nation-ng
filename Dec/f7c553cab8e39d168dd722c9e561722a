Suspected killers of the Olufon of Ifon, Ose Local Government Area of Ondo State, Oba Israel Adeusi, have been arrested. They were arrested by a combined team of security operatives at Elegbaka. Oba Adeusi was murdered last Thursday by suspected kidnappers between Elegbeka and Ifon while returning from a meeting in Akure. Commander of the Ondo Security Network Agency, also known as Amotekun Corps, Chief Adetunji Adeleye, said four kidnapped victims were also rescued during the pursuit of Oba Adeusi’s killers. Adeleye said the suspects were being interrogated. He debunked insinuations that his men were not in the bush, adding that surveillance has been mounted at the farm of the late Chief Olu Falae to prevent further attacks. He said: “Operation Clean Up, launched on Tuesday, led to the arrest of over 20 suspects from various black spots in Akure and environs. “Some of the suspects were caught while robbing.” Adeleye added that some cows were also seized while destroying a farm and the herders fled. He said the cows would not be released until the owners reached amicable agreement with the farmers whose crops were destroyed.
