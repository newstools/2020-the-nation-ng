Super Eagles defender Semi Ajayi scored his first premier league goal as Liverpool were held to a frustrating 1-1 draw against West Bromwich Albion on Sunday at Anfield. Ajayi scored a late equaliser to cancel out Sadio Mane’s first-half opener as Liverpool failed to open up a five-point lead at the top. Liverpool also suffered another injury concern when Joel Matip limped off with a groin injury in the second half.  West Brom earned their first point under new boss Sam Allardyce but remain in the relegation zone. Liverpool dominated possession from the first minute and opened the scoring after 12 minutes when Matip clipped the ball into Mane who chested it down and rifled a shot past West Brom goalkeeper Sam Johnstone. West Brom grabbed their equaliser after 82 minutes when Ajayi headed in from Matheus Pereira’s cross.
