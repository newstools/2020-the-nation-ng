 THE Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has warned the investing public from dealing with Famzhi Interbiz Limited, describing it as an illegal fund management firm. The Commission stated that Famzhi is not registered to operate in the Nigerian capital market. According to the Commission, the company had applied for registration to operate in the capital market but was unable to fulfil certain regulatory pre-conditions required for the grant of registration. “Despite not being registered by the Commission, the company had proceeded to unlawfully solicit funds from the investing public on products neither registered nor approved by the Commission, with the promise of a guaranteed return on investment in clear violation of the Securities and Investment Act (ISA) 2007,” SEC stated at the weekend. SEC said it has referred Famzhi to the appropriate law enforcement agency for criminal investigation and possible prosecution for violation of the provisions of the Investments and Securities Act 2007 and other relevant laws in Nigeria. “In view of the above, the general public is advised to always confirm the registration status of any entity offering fund management or any other capital market services from the Commission’s website or by visiting any of the Commission’s offices,” SEC stated. The Commission warned that any person who subscribes to any product of an unregistered entity or enters into any dealing with an entity, does so at his own risk
