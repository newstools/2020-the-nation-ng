On Saturday 14th November, 2020, former Senate President Bukola Saraki arrived Ilorin, the Kwara State capital, for the first time since the 2019 general election. He had in February 2019 lost his bid to return to the National Assembly. Sentry gathered that the former Kwara governor was at his home town for the eighth-year Fidau prayer for his late dad, Dr. Olusola Saraki and the silver jubilee anniversary of the coronation of the Emir of Ilorin, Ibrahim Sulu-Gambari. Truth be told, Saraki was welcomed by a huge crowd of supporters. Almost all pedestrian bridges and high rise buildings along the roads from the airport to his family’s GRA residence were taken over by eager onlookers. Determined to utilise the political mileage offered him by the visit to the fullest, the younger Oloye rode in a motorcade all the way to his residence and the palace while people cheered. Since that visit, talk in Kwara, especially among supporters of the ex-Senate President and the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has largely been about how come 2023, the people of the state will reject the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and reinstate Saraki’s political family in Government House with their votes. According to some ‘Sarakites’ who boasted to Sentry, the Otoge revolution that swept away PDP and Saraki in 2019 is about to be replaced by Otunya, the movement that will restore both to power. But chieftains of the ruling party will have none of such ‘idle talk’ as they describe boasts about an Otunya movement. Even some non-partisan residents of Ilorin brush aside the possibility of PDP returning to power in 2023. “Is it because of the rented crowd you saw last month? Otunya to where? Come 2023, we will sustain the gains of Otoge by ensuring PDP is roundly defeated again,” one commentator said.
