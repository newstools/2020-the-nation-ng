 BENUE State Police Anti-robbery Squad code-named “Operation Zenda” has smashed a kidnap and robbery gang, which has been terrorising residents on Taraku-Naka Road in Gwer and Gwer West local governments. The gang is also said to be behind most of the robberies and kidnapping in Benue South Senatorial District, especially in Otukpo, the headquarters of Benue South Senatorial District. Following robbery and kidnapping incidents along Taraku-Naka road, the anti-robbery squad under the command of CSO Justine Gberidyer mounted surveillance along the busy highway. Luck ran out on the hoodlums last weekend as they wore police uniform, mounted a roadblock and robbed passengers. Men and officers of Police “Operation Dzenda” swooped on them and arrested two of the kidnappers, while others ran into the bush. However, one was shot dead during exchange of gunfire with the police. Another robber, who attempted to escape with a passenger bus belonging to Gombe State Mass Transport Company, lost control and rammed into a tree. He died on the spot, while the stranded passengers were rescued.
