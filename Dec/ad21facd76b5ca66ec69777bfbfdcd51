A petrol tanker explosion about 4am on Wednesday caused gridlock on the Lagos/Ibadan Expressway. The explosion, which happened on Magboro Bridge, near the Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries (MFM) Prayer City, triggered traffic snarls which spread to several kilometres on both sides of the road. There was no casualty report as at last night. Officials of the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC), police, and fire-fighters battled to contain the fire. The FRSC, in a statement by its Lagos/Ibadan/Egbeda Corridor Commander, Kehinde Hamzat, advised those plying the corridor to reconsider their journey or brace up for delays. It reads: “The FRSC advise the public to plan their trips for today. The tanker explosion on Magboro Bridge, on the outward Lagos section, happened about 04.15hrs yesterday. It calls for the need to adjust our movement for the day. “The fire was still burning at 05.20hrs and this means a total standstill. “Efforts are on to extinguish the fire. We therefore advise the public to plan their trips or cancel. We also advise travellers to explore alternative routes where necessary.”
