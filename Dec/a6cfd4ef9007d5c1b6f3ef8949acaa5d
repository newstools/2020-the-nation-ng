 NINE persons have so far been killed in the recent cult clashes in Ebonyi State. Commissioner for Internal Security and Border Peace Stanley Okoremegha said this yesterday in Abakaliki after the security council meeting. He said the clash is between two fraternities. The commissioner said Governor David Umahi has given security agencies directive to arrest anybody involved in the killings, no matter how highly placed. He said so far, 37 suspects have been arrested and will soon be arraigned. Okoremegha said the Department of State Services (DSS) had begun investigation into the ammunition discovered at the popular Building Materials Market in Abakaliki. The market was cordoned off by security forces last week following information that ammunition was brought into the place by miscreants. Okoremegha said 9,000 live ammunition were recovered from the market.
