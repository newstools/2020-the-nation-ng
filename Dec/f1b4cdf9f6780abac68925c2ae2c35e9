Your support and kindness have warmed my heart to the core, and I cannot express with words how much it means to my family and myself. Thank you. “We love you, Papa. It hurts badly. And while we will miss you desperately, we know we have been truly blessed to have had a husband, father, brother, uncle, and grandfather like you. Till we meet again to part no more. I love you so much.”
