 NEW channels for telecommunication subscribers to link their National Identity Number (NIN) with their SIM cards have been announced by Globacom. The announcement which was made in Lagos by the telecommunications provider, was to enable its customers seamlessly complete the update process in compliance with the directive of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC). The expanded channels entail the following: “Firstly, our customers can simply text their NIN to 109. Alternatively, they may dial *109# or *109*your NIN# directly. Customers can also call 109 to update their NIN via voice call.” The company stated in its announcement. “Customers who do not have their NIN can dial *346# to retrieve the number if they have already registered with the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC), while those yet to register are reminded to visit any NIN enrolment center to get one.” Globacom further said. These new measures are part of the company’s commitment to ensuring that customers have an uninterrupted experience on its network, and is also a demonstration of its support for the regulators efforts to create a secure and sustainable industry. All Globacom subscribers with further enquiries are encouraged to contact any of its customer contact channels or visit https://www.gloworld.com/ng/nin for further support.
