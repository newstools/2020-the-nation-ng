 Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr said the return of footballing activities especially the kick-off of the Nigeria Professional Football league (NPFL) 2020-21 season is a welcome development and something to cheer about. The 2020-21 season got off the ground on Sunday and the German watched one of the rescheduled games in the comfort of his home in France via the NPFL TV app on Tuesday as Enyimba beat Abia Warriors 1-0. “I saw an interesting game yesterday (Tuesday),” the former Bayern Munich defender told NationSport from his base in France.“ I’m happy that NFPL is starting again. “After a long interruption, the players need time to get the rhythm but I could see that most of them are physically well prepared. “But sorry for my friend Imama (coach of Abia Warriors) but Enyimba was the better team.”
Meanwhile, in another rescheduled NPFL match played in Port Harcourt yesterday, a 10-men Rivers United pipped Rangers International 1-0 at the Yakubu Gowon Stadium. Fortune Omoniwari struck in the 29th minute with what eventually proved to the winner for Stanley Eguma’s side. The hosts were reduced to ten men with 15 minutes left after Cletus Emotan was shown two quick-fire yellows, first for a foul and then for dissent. Rivers goalkeeper Theophilus Afelokhai nearly gifted the visitors an equaliser when he spilled a free kick late on, but an onrushing attacking could only fire over the crossbar sparing the goalie’s blushes and ensuring the home side gathered all three points.
