An Osun State High Court in Ilesha has sentenced Sola Emorua (29) to death for the robbery of kerosene and petrol laden tankers. Prosecution lawyer from the Ministry of Justice, Mrs. Motolani Sokefun, said Emorua and others at large, about 5.30pm on May 7, 2015, at Ayorunto Area, Ilesha/Akure Expressway, Osu, robbed Ismaila Azeez of his tanker (XV 298 APP) loaded with 33,000 litres of kerosene. Sokefun said a few weeks later, Emorua and his gang robbed another petrol-laden at the same spot. Unfortunately, they were intercepted by the police and two members of the gang arrested. The prosecutor called three witnesses and tendered several exhibits, including a confessional statement of the convict, circumstantial evidence and evidence of eyewitness to the crime. “Ismail and Ibrahim Azeez, who were victims, identified Emorua as part of the gang that robbed them,” she added. Emorua’s lawyer Kehinde Aworele said the confessional statement was denied by the convict. He claimed that the two statements were written by policemen and after a prolonged torture, the convict signed it. Emorua also claimed to be a mechanic and had come to Ilesha to repair a vehicle, but was arrested while returning to his base in Ore, Ondo State. Justice Isiaka Adeleke said the prosecutor has proven his case beyond reasonable doubt and found Emorua guilty on the two charges preferred against him. He therefore sentenced him to death by hanging for robbery and conspiracy.
