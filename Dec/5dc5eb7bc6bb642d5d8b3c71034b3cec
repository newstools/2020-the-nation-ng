 THE Embassy of the Republic of Korea has donated 30,000 made-in-Korea diagnostic kits to the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 (PTF). The donation was received by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, from the South Korean Ambassador to Nigeria Lee In-tae on behalf of Nigeria. In a statement by the Director of Korean Cultural Centre in Nigeria, Mr. Lee Jin Su, the envoy lauded Nigeria’s fight against the pandemic, saying his country will continue to support Nigeria until the virus is defeated. He said: “I would also like to use this opportunity to commend the Nigerian Government for its hard efforts and great success in the fight against COVID-19. In these challenging times, I wish to reaffirm Korea’s strong solidarity with the people of Nigeria. Korea will continue to support Nigeria so that together, we can win this war against COVID-19. “This year also marks the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Korea and Nigeria. We have been friends for a long time, and I am confident to say that during my service as the Korean Ambassador, our relationship has become rock-solid like the Zuma Rock. “When the pandemic first hit Nigeria and you reached out to the world to seek support, Korea was there to hold your hand. The Korean Government supported your efforts to battle the disease by providing Korean facial masks and PPEs both to the Federal and State Governments. We also provided palliatives for local communities. “Many Korean companies also joined our efforts to assist Nigeria. Samsung Heavy Industries donated 5,000 PCR test kits to the Federal Government. Hyundai Motors donated PPEs worth N35 million to the Government of Lagos State. “And now, I am proud to deliver another 30,000 PCR test kits to Nigeria. They say ‘a friend in need is a friend indeed.’ Nigeria can always count on us in times of need, because we are true friends.”
