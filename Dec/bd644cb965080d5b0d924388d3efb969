 THE Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria (PSN) has destroyed N18.7 million fake and expired drugs in Akwa Ibom State. Chairman Dr. Akwaowo Akpabio, who stated this at the weekend, called for the reconstitution of the taskforce on fake and expired drugs. He urged the government to empower the taskforce to rid the state of unhealthy drugs. According to him, PSN is determined to tackle fake and expired drugs, but needs government backup to do so. Commissioner for Health Prof. Augustine Umoh, represented by Otobong Umana, said the state will work with the PSN and other relevant agencies to rid the state of fake and expired drugs.
