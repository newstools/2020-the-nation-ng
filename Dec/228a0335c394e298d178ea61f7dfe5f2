The Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 Pandemic has warned Nigerians to avoid large gathering events during the Christmas/New Year festivities. Chairman of the PTF and Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) Boss Mustapha, who was represented by the Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, stated this on Thursday during the task forceâ€™s media briefing in Abuja. The SGF, who urged Nigerians to reinforce their efforts to stay alive in the face of the spiking cases of the virus, notified that the hope of accessing vaccines for the treatment would not be immediate. He added that vaccines alone cannot cure the infection. The Federal Government is reactivating treatment centres across the country as the cases of covid-19 increases, Minister of Health Dr. Osagie Ehanire said on Thursday. He also noted that due to the rising cases of patients needing admission, especially those severely afflicted with the virus, there will be an urgent need for more hospital beds. Chairman of Southeast Governors Forum and Ebonyi State Governor David Umahi has been nominated as Covid-19 National Champion by the PTF. The nomination was announced in a letter to the governor by the National Coordinator of the Task Force, Dr. Sani Aliyu.
