Executive Secretary, Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) Dr. Hamid Bobboyi has said children need basic vocational skills to survive. Bobboyi, who was the special guest at the Nigerian Military School 2019/2020 Academic session passing out parade and inauguration of Universal Basic Education Vocational Centre, said most successful entrepreneurs in Nigeria started by acquiring a vocational skill in high demand in the society. “Vocational Education assists individual in better performance of their job as they acquire a great learning experience,” he said. He said the vocational school was introduced by UBEC to address the out-of-school challenge in some states of the federation. The centre is equipped with computers and electrical equipment and accessories. The Nigeria Military School came into being May 20, 1954 with an initial intake of 30 boys known as “the first platoon”. The NMS offers both military and academic activities. With the introduction of the new policy of education, the school now runs a six-year training programme broken into junior and senior secondary classes of three years duration each. All the subjects required by this policy are being taught at the school.
