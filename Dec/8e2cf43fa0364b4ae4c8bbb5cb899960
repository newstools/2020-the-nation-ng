 A notorious banditry and kidnap kingpin terrorising Kaduna-Abuja highway and other parts of Kaduna State, Nasiru Kachalla, has been confirmed killed. He was killed alongside other bandits during a clash between his gang and a rival group of bandits. Kaduna State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs Samuel Aruwan, who confirmed the development in a statement yesterday, said Kachalla masterminded the kidnap of four seminarians and killing of one of them in January. He said: “Security agencies have confirmed to the Kaduna State Government the killing of a notorious bandit, Nasiru Kachalla.  “Kachalla, who had been on the run for masterminding several criminal acts, including kidnappings, killings, cattle rustling and banditry, was killed in a clash between his gang and a rival group of bandits. “Human intelligence networks confirmed that criminals from the rival sides were also killed, including some of Kachalla’s lieutenants. “The clash occurred in a forest around the boundaries of Kajuru-Chikun Local Government in Kaduna Central Senatorial District. A dispute over a large herd of rustled cattle is said to have triggered the fatal confrontation.”
