  National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) yesterday distributed foodstuff and building materials to flood victims in the eight local governments of Bayelsa State. Items distributed include rice, millet, beans, garri, cooking stoves, cement and roofing zinc. Head of NEMA’s Edo Operations Office Dahiru Yusuf said the items donated were only for the 2020 flood victims. Yusuf said the distribution would prevent most of the items, especially foodstuff, from going bad. He said: “The items will be shared according to the most affected areas, while those  less affected will get little. “We urged them to share the items without bias. They should get to the affected victims in their areas.”
