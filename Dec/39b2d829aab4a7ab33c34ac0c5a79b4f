A 20-year-old identified as Jude was set ablaze by his lover for allegedly refusing to marry her. The victim allegedly said the girl hated his mother. An eyewitness said the couple had a heated argument earlier in the day and Jude sent her packing. Things however took a twist about 1.30am when the girl returned to the compound with three men. They tore the window nets, poured petrol into the house, and lighted a fire. Jude and his mother were sleeping in the house. They raised an alarm and neighbours rescued them. Jude however sustained serious injuries. Jude is receiving treatment at a hospital in Gboko while his girlfriend is on the run. The police said investigation has begun.
