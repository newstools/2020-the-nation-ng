Pula uses the crop cut experiment as a claim assessment procedure instead of just relying on satellite data as a means of compensation trigger. This assessment relies heavily on actual crop cuts exercise at the farmer level and feedback is fed on enumerator’s Pula mobile apps which relay instant after-harvest season feedback to clients’ monitoring dashboards.” This year, the Awards featured two-panel discussions with industry leaders like Richard Lowe, Hammam Badr, Patrick Tumbo , Dominic Christian and prominent economists like Ludovic Subran and Carlos Lopez who reflected on the impact of Covid-19 in the African economy, especially the insurance industry, and how it can be rebuilt after the pandemic.
