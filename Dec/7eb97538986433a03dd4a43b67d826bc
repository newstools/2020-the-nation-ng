Imo State Governor Hope Uzodimma has completely relaxed the existing curfew of 10p.m. to 6a.m. imposed on the state at the wake of the #ENDSARS protest. Uzodimma announced this after reviewing security situation and measures put in place by security agencies to contain the mayhem caused during the protest and the attendant activities of hoodlums that accompanied the demonstration. During the protests, public and private properties were destroyed and some security agents killed. Announcing the removal of the curfew, Chief Press Secretary/Media Adviser to the state governor, Oguwike Nwachuku, quoted Uzodimma as saying that the decision was taken after a careful evaluation of the security situation in the state and measures taken to check the excesses of the #EndSARS protests. He said: â€œHaving observed that the situation (threat) has remarkably improved and with due consultations with security agencies, the state has decided to totally relax the curfew to enable the citizens go about their normal businesses without fear of molestation or harassment. He warned unions or groups to steer clear of anything, actions or inactions that will lead to any form of protest and advised that where there is any reason for a protest or procession, the group must obtain police permit from the Commissioner of Police before embarking on any of such actions.
