  The following Statement speaks for itself. The regular readers of this column are aware of my deep and sustained interest in the Black Lives Matter movement as currently the most successful and influential movement for the rights and dignity of Black people everywhere in the world. For this reason, the crisis in the BLM indicated in the statement below is, I imagine, of great concern to all Black people and progressives of all racial communities and all zonal constituencies of the world. For the most part, I shall let the Statement speak for itself, mostly because the crisis indicated in the Statement is in its inception. However, because the Statement casts a retrospective shadow on all the things I have written about the BLM in this column, I will append a short comment, a brief reflection, on the need for the structural and ideological reinvention of the BLM that is inherent in the Statement.  It is Time for Accountability  It was recently declared that Patrisse Cullors was appointed the Executive Director to the Black Lives Matter Global Network (BLMGN) Foundation. Since then, two new Black Lives Matter formations have been announced to the public: a Black Lives Matter Political Action Committee and BLM Grassroots. BLM Grassroots was allegedly created to support the organizational needs of chapters, separate from the financial functions of BLMGN. We, the undersigned chapters, believe that all of these events occurred without democracy, and assert that it was without the knowledge of the majority of Black Lives Matters chapters across the country and world. We became chapters of Black Lives Matter as radical Black organizers embracing a collective vision for Black people engaging in the protracted struggle for our lives against police terrorism. With a willingness to do hard work that would put us at risk, we expected that the central organizational entity, most recently referred to as the Black Lives Matter Global Network (BLMGN) Foundation, would support us chapters in our efforts to build communally. Since the establishment of BLMGN, our chapters have consistently raised concerns about financial transparency, decision making, and accountability. Despite years of effort, no acceptable internal process of accountability has ever been produced by BLMGN and these recent events have undermined the efforts of chapters seeking to democratize its processes and resources. In the spirit of transparency, accountability, and responsibility to our community, we believe public accountability has become necessary. As a contribution to our collective liberation, we must make clear:        We remain committed to collectively building an organization of BLM chapters that is democratic, accountable, and functions in a way that is aligned with our ideological values and commitment to liberation. We will move forward with transparency and expound on our collective efforts to seek transparency and organizational unity in a fuller statement in the near future. As we collectively determine next steps, we encourage our supporters to donate directly to chapters, who represent the frontline of Black Lives Matter. We understand that these issues are not new and that some chapters left, were not acknowledged, or were pushed out of network with the community of chapters because of them.

Comment/Reflection  In all the articles that I have written on the BLM in this column, I have placed great emphasis on the “leaderlessness”, the deliberately decentralized organizational structure of the BLM. I was particularly emphatic on the fact that this “leaderlessness” was a departure from the traditions and practices of all previous civil rights organizations and movements in the United States. In lauding this crucial aspect of the BLM, I ascribed its remarkable successes, especially in the current period, to this loose and sparsely coordinated structure. To make this point, I argued that unlike most civil rights and direct action organizations of the past and the present, BLM was notable in how very thinly connected the chapters and branches of the organization were to the central, “coordinating’ body, a formation that actually seemed unwilling to tightly “coordinate” the activities of the chapters and branches. In this organizational and ideological context, the Statement republished here seems to be pitched as a robust challenge to, indeed a radical departure from what the BLM has been so far. It is too early to say how BLM will react to this challenge from the seven self-identified chapters. Definitely, these are some of the most active and vibrant branches. And there is the possibility that seven will become fourteen and that might become twenty-eight and so on and so forth. Who knows, we might even soon have a National Convention of all or most of the chapters of the BLM, something that has neve taken place or, indeed, seemed thinkable at all! The reader may have perceived that the challenge of the seven dissenters does not raise the fundamental issue of BLM’s ideological and practical commitment to decentralized revolutionary praxis. Indeed, the dissenters astutely pitch their rebellion on an assertion of the need for “internal democracy”, knowing fully well that it would be difficult for any activist organization or movement to admit to a lack of interest in, or dedication to “internal democracy”. But how does “internal democracy” arise or apply to a movement whose branches and chapters almost entirely operate as completely separate and independent units? Dear readers, please understand this: no emissaries, no revolutionary apparatchiks ever went out from a central body to form each of the city, state and regional zones of the BLM; all of them were self-constituted.  Well, is it then the case that the time has come when the movement’s remarkable successes have brought things to a new horizon of organization development or, in the words of the title of this piece, reinvention? Only time will tell. Perhaps the most delicate or even startling issue raised by the dissenters is that of “accountability”, especially with regard to alleged “millions of dollars” donated to the central body. Notably, the Statement does not make any bald accusations of financial misdeeds. Rather, the claim is twofold in its expression. First, it is alleged, quite rightly I might add, that the central body, the BLMGN, receives “millions of dollars” from unnamed, unidentified sources. Secondly, it is alleged that the process whereby BLMGN sends subventions to some branches and not to others is not transparent and is even unknown to most of the branches of the movement. But the BLM, together with its organs, is not your typical NGO or civil society organization. Permit me to be absolutely frank about this aspect of the BLM: if and when its fundraising activities become the subject of open and acrimonious disputes, then it has begun the path to a routinization that will bring it closer and closer to what we expect and know of bourgeois political parties and nonprofit humanitarian organizations. Who among its most generous donors as well as its cadres and militants scattered around the world, who ever asked the ANC in the long period of its frontline anti-apartheid struggle to give an account of how monies it received were disbursed? I confess that in all the articles on the BLM that I published in this column, I was deliberately silent on the movement’s remarkable successes in recent years in raising funds. I was silent on this aspect of the BLM because, quite frankly, it is somewhat naïve both to be surprised that an organization like BLM raises substantial amounts of funds and to ask how it makes use of the funds that it raises. I have read the histories of many revolutionary organizations and movements in the modern world and never have I encountered an open, “accountable” auditing of how these organizations raise and spend funds! Is this case of the BLM and the BLMGN an aberration? No, not quite. Just don’t expect that this will be the cause of a routinization of the BLM. As I stated earlier in this discussion, this is only an initial or provisional comment. If I have given the impression that this Statement of dissent on the BLM is unjustifiable and will probably go nowhere, I hasten to deny any such intention. Indeed, what is uppermost in my mind is the thought that this is likely to be the beginning of a process of renewal or reinvention which, in all likelihood, will lead at first to fragmentations of the BLM as a movement. The contours of these are still unclear, but I make bold to say that at least two factions will eventually crystalize: one faction will continue on the path of leaderlessness and decentralization that has so far been dominant; another faction will return to a past that will become a new future, this being the future past of revolutionary and activist organizations that are hierarchical and centralized. And need I say this, with admixtures of these two prototypes of the centralized and the decentralized. Black people and all dominated and oppressed peoples of the world will have their day of liberation, with or without centralized and hierarchical movements.
