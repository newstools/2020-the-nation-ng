Two notorious armed robbery suspects, Aliyu Shuaibu Dille, 22, and Rabiu Muktar, 28, have been arrested by the police in Kano State. A Pump Action rifle was recovered. The suspects have long been on the police wanted list, police spokesman, Abdullahi Haruna who paraded them on Wednesday, said. Haruna, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), said a team of Operation Puff Adder led by Yunusa Danzomo of Badawa Division, arrested the suspects during surveillance patrol in Badawa Quarters, Kano. During interrogation, the two-man syndicate confessed they have participated in series of armed robberies along Hadejia Road by Sheshe Super Market, Yankaba Quarters and Badawa Quarters, Kano.

Kano State Commissioner of Police, Habu Sani, ordered that the case be transferred to the Commandâ€™s Criminal Investigation Department (CID) for discreet probe. Police said the suspects will be charged to court upon completion of the investigation.
