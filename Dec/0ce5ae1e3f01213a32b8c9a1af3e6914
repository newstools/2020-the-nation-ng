Katsina State Government is to uplift its information delivery and enlightenment generation through the commencement of the refurbishing and upgrading of the television, radio and news publications. Information, Culture & Home Affairs Commissioner Alhaji Abdulakarim Yahaya Sirika, briefing reporters at the Government House, Katsina, said the prevailing socio-economic challenges, coupled with the advent of COVID-19 pandemic, had made recent innovations imperative. He said some of the achievements made by his ministry in the passing year included re-introduction of three print tabloids for wider public awareness of government activities, establishment of content management centre at the ministry for efficient state’s website activities and upgrading the state’s television through digitalisation and securing Internet connection through android. Sirika said: “Despite the financial crunch arising from the global economic meltdown and the side effect of the COVID-19 globally, Governor Aminu Bello Masari has encouraged media activities in the state through the ministry and has become one of the best media friends among the governors. ‘’The Information department is regarded as the public relations department of the ministry, as it projects the image of the government through activities, including press releases, publications, campaigns, research and media outlets such as television and radio.’’ Admitting that his ministry remained one of the largest in the state, he assured the citizens that it would not relent in the task of informing, educating, sensitising and enlightening the people.
