MANCHESTER City have confirmed a coronavirus outbreak at the club as Kyle Walker, Gabriel Jesus and two members of staff have tested positive. The four will now self-isolate in line with government guidelines meaning Walker and Jesus will miss the Boxing Day game against Newcastle and are likely to be unavailable to Pep Guardiola for games against Everton and Chelsea either side of new year. Both players featured in Manchester City’s 4-1 win over Arsenal in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday night.  Fears over the spread of the virus within football are growing following the emergence of the new variant of Covid-19, with players and staff in Tier 4 areas to now be tested twice weekly, as they were during Project Restart last season. A club statement read: “Manchester City FC can confirm that Gabriel Jesus, Kyle Walker, and two members of staff have tested positive for Covid-19. “All four personnel will now observe a period of self-isolation in accordance with Premier League and UK Government protocol on quarantine. “Everyone at the Club wishes our colleagues a speedy recovery over the Christmas period ahead of their return to work, training and competition.”
