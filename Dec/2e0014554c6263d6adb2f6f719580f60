Co-conveners of the #EndSARS protest in Osun State have distanced themselves from another round of protest that broke out in the state on Monday. They described the new protest as self-serving, needless, unnecessary and capable of compromising the peace and progress of the state. A group of youths, led by Emmanuel Adebayo, on Monday, staged a protest to the House of Assembly in Osogbo, demanding, among others, the disbandment of the State Panel of Enquiry Against Police Brutality for alleged non-inclusion of EndSARS activists in the panel. But in a letter to the State Director of the Department of State Service (DSS), the EndSARS co-conveners dissociated themselves from the fresh protest. They said Adebayo was pursuing a different agenda that was personal to him and had nothing to do with EndSARS agitations in Osun State. The letter was signed by Ayo Ologun; Rauf Sadiq Success; Oluwasegun Idowu; Babawale Popoola; Ismaheel Abdulazeez; Nigerian Youth Council State Chairman Teslim Salawudeen; President of National Association of Osun State Students (NAOSS) and Queen Fisayo Aderemi.
