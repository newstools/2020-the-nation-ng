 THE ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has said the death of the National Chairman of Labour Party (LP), Alhaji Abdulkadir Abdulsalam, is a major loss to the country’s opposition politics and democracy. In a condolence message on Wednesday in Abuja by its Secretary Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, the APC eulogised Abdulsalam for his contributions to the country’s democratic development. The statement reads: “The APC extends condolences to members of Nigeria’s Labour Party over the death of the party’s National Chairman, Alhaji Abdulkadir Abdulsalam. “We mourn the late Abdulsalam, whose passage is a major loss to Nigeria’s opposition politics and our democracy.” “In line with the Labour Party’s mantra, as its National Chairman, the late Abdulsalam will be remembered for his efforts to entrench Labour Party as the party for social democracy and advocate for the welfare of workers, particularly the increment of minimum wage.” The party also commiserated with the immediate family of Abdulsalam and prayed “Almighty Allah to forgives his shortcomings and grant him Al-Jannah Fir’daous”. Abdulsalam reportedly slumped on Tuesday and died.
