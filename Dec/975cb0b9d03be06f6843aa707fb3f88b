 EBONYI State Governor David Umahi has declared war on cultism and cultists. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that many people have been killed and injured in cult clashes. The governor spoke at the Christ Embassy Church, Abakaliki, during a special family thanksgiving. He said: “We have very serious cult activities in Ebonyi and I warn that we are starting the fight against cultism soon. “I will not spare anybody who is involved in cultism; the trouble I will make with such persons will not be in the state. The cultist will be taken to Abuja and those arrested will give us the names of cultists in Ebonyi and we will come after them.” The governor assured the people of adequate security, and directed that the school which was shut down in Ezza South Local Government Area for cult activities remain closed. He said: “People can write what they like but I cannot offend God with my position. They wrote that the school was shut because its proprietor refused to join the All Progressive Congress (APC) but the question remains, ‘who is such a person in the society’. Umahi also directed the Commissioner for Education to ensure schools conclude the 2020 academic activities by December 17, while the distribution of palliatives at various polling units is scheduled for December 18 and 20.
