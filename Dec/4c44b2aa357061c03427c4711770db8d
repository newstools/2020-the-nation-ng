The Lagos State government has warned that enforcement of COVID-19 protocols is now on, asking citizens to be vigilant and to take responsibility for their actions, health and safety. Commissioner for Information Mr. Gbenga Omotoso said as part of the enforcement, some clubs were shut down last weekend. Event centres, he added, are being monitored and motorcyclists are being arrested for carrying passengers. Omotoso: “Enforcement is on. Some clubs were shut down last weekend. Event centres are being monitored and motorcyclists are being grabbed for carrying passengers and making nonsense of the social distancing regulation.” According to the commissioner, environmental officers have been detailed to be present at public religious or social gatherings and have been trained in basic first aid procedures. “The state Safety Commission has been saddled with the responsibility of visiting event centres to ensure compliance with the established guidelines, to stop the virus from spreading. “Where there is evidence of a lack of compliance at any event centre, it will be shut down immediately, as it happened with Cabana night club at the weekend. “Security agents have also been mandated to ensure full enforcement of the COVID-19 protocol without; exception as no one will be deemed to be above the law.” Also at the weekend, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu warned: “Breaches of these regulations and public health protocols will lead to immediate closure as well as attract heavy fines, and any other sanctions and penalties deemed fit, in line with the Lagos State Infectious Diseases Control Regulation 2020.”
