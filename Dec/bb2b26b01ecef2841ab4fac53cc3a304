The first leg holds between December 22 and 23 while the second leg takes place between January 5 and 6, 2021. Meanwhile, Rivers United’s coach Stanley Eguma  has admitted that the late start of the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) has been the undoing of teams campaigning in the continental tournaments. “That our league has not started is a big setback for all the teams playing in the CAF Competitions unlike other countries in Africa that have been playing their leagues in the last two months,” explained Eguma. “Teams have not been able to test their strength against strong oppositions while most of the players are rusty. “ This has been a major problem in Nigeria which I think those in charge of football should be concerned about and found a lasting solution to this trend,” Eguma lamented.
