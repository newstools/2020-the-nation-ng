President Donald Trump has told Joe Biden to ‘get well soon’ after the president-elect fractured his ankle while playing with his German Shepherd Major. Biden suffered the injury on Saturday and visited an orthopaedist at Delaware Orthopaedic Specialists in Newark, Delaware, for an examination Sunday afternoon, his office said. As Biden, who will likely be wearing a walking boot for several weeks, was getting ready to leave the doctor’s office, he was photographed by NBC News getting into a vehicle. Trump later retweeted NBC’s video and surprisingly wrote to Biden: ‘Get well soon!’ Initially, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said Biden ‘sustained a sprain of his right foot’ and that there was ‘no obvious fracture’. But a subsequent CT scan ‘confirmed hairline (small) fractures of President-elect Biden’s lateral and intermediate cuneiform bones, which are in the mid-foot,’ according to a statement from O’Connor. ‘It is anticipated that he will likely require a walking boot for several weeks,’ O’Conner added.

Fractures are a concern generally as people age, but Biden’s appears to be a relatively mild one based on his doctor’s statement and the planned treatment.
