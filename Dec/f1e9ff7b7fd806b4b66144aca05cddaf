Chelsea were briefly linked with Samuel Chukwueze back in May, after which the Blues went on to acquire other young attacking players in the summer transfer window instead. According to La Razón however, Chelsea are one of many teams still interested in the increasingly in-demand Nigeria international. Other teams credited with interest include primarily Real Madrid, and also Manchester United, Liverpool, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Everton and Leicester City. Chukwueze, who plays predominantly as a right winger, has scored 1 goal and provided 3 assists in 13 appearances for Villarreal this season. End-product may not be his strongest suit just yet, with the 21-year-old depending on his dribbling prowess to create chances, but if he can add that to his game as well, he’d be a real threat indeed. The report doesn’t provide much any actual detail on Chelsea’s interest — Real Madrid are said to be driving the hardest for his signature at the moment — with his 80m Euros release clause the only information of value. While Chelsea are quite stacked in the attacking positions right now, Olivier Giroud’s possible (imminent?) departure could create space in the squad — although that could also depend on the position Frank Lampard sees Timo Werner playing in the future.
