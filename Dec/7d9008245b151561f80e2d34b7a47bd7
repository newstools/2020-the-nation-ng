 EHEBERECHI Eze has adapted quickly to the Premier League and manager Roy Hodgson has insisted that he’s not too surprised with how good the winger has been since joining Crystal Palace in the summer transfer window. The Anglo-Nigerian had a banner 2019-2020, registering 14 goals and eight assists and winning Queens Park Rangers’ Player of the Season accolade, leading to Premier League clubs scrambling for his signature. Eze has blended seamlessly into the Crystal Palace side, starting their last six games in the Premier League. On Eze, Hodgson told reporters during Friday’s press conference : “It’s a case for a lot of players out of the Championship, but they also seem to me to be proving they can reach that level. “Surprised only in you never know how long it will take a player to get his feet under the table at a club. “But if you’re confident about what a player can bring to the team, you don’t need to be too surprised, just happy that it’s gone so well for a player that can be a big advantage in the years to come.” The 22-year-old Eze was named Crystal Palace Player of the Month for November and was the recipient of the Goal of the Month award.
