The killing of the ALL Progressives Congress (APC) chairman in Nasarawa State, Mr. Phillip Shekwo, is callous and wicked, National Leader Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, stated this on Tuesday. He commiserated with Governor Abdullahi Sule and the local chapter of the party over the killing of the chairman. Shekwo was kidnapped in his house and was later killed by his abductors. His body was found in the bush on November 22. In a letter to the governor, Tinubu said: “By this letter, I convey to you my deepest condolences over the killing of the Chairman of Nasarawa State chapter of our party, the APC, Mr. Phillip Shekwo. “Shekwo’s killing was a callous, wicked and dastardly act. He did not deserve to die the way he did. Indeed, no one deserves to be so killed in such a gruesome manner. “I commiserate with you and the government of Nasarawa State. I hope and pray that security agents will get to the bottom of this horrid killing and bring the perpetrators to book. “My hearts also go out to the family of the deceased, the immediate-past governor of Nasarawa State, Alhaji Tanko Al-Makura, and the teeming APC members in the state. “I pray that Almighty Allah comfort them all. In particular, I pray that Allah stand by the wife and children, and indeed by all those left behind by the deceased.”
