Justice Olusegun Agboola of the Osun State High Court in Osogbo yesterday found Muhammad guilty of rape and indecent assault of the minor. The convict was arraigned on August 3 on three counts of rape, defilement and indecent assault. Prosecution lawyer from the Ministry of Justice Idayat Abdulrahman called five witnesses and tendered six exhibits which were admitted in evidence by the court. Among the exhibits tendered are a confessional statement of the convict, circumstantial evidence and medical report. According to Abdulrahman, the victim, about 8pm on April 19, was iside the kitchen when Muhammed attacked her, covered her mouth, laid her on the floor and forcefully had carnal knowledge of her. She added further that on April 20, Araoye Bolanle (26), (the victim’s aunt) saw houseflies on the victim, which prompted her to do a thorough checking. She discovered blood and sperm stain on the victim’s private part when she wanted to bathe her. The victim then narrated how she was raped by Muhammed to her aunt. A suspected robber was on Sunday burnt by a mob around Oke-Ogbo Ilode Area in Ile-Ife. It was gathered the incident happened about 10:30am. This is coming barely 10 days after two persons were burnt for suspected bike theft in Lagere Area. The suspect had snatched a bike from a commercial motorcyclist at gunpoint. He was pursued and arrested before he was eventually killed by the mob. An eyewitness said two persons were involved in the theft but one escaped. “Some of the people waited till the fire went off before cutting some body parts away,” he said. Police spokesperson Yemisi Opalola said the suspect was burnt before the police arrived at the scene.
