Three persons, including a People’s Democratic Party (PDP) ward chairman have been reportedly arrested for illegal possession of arms and ammunition by military operatives deployed to restore calm in warring Emede and Igbide kingdoms, Isoko South council area of Delta State. The Nation gathered that the PDP chieftain, identified as Christopher Irivi-Ubulubu, doubles as the chairman of Igbide ward and overall chairman of all the PDP wards in the local government. He was said to have been under military interrogation until he was handed over to the Delta State Police Command through the Oleh Police Division on Friday. The three suspects were reportedly arrested at their hideouts in a government school in Igbide community. While details surrounding the arrest were still sketchy as of the time of filing this report, sources suggest that it may not be unconnected to the communal conflict between Igbide and Emede kingdoms which has claimed five lives and left properties worth millions of naira, destroyed in Emede kingdom. Sources said that the attack on Emede by youths of Igbide kingdom saw persons in military camouflage and the use of sophisticated firearms. Both communities have had an age-long land tussle, which sources claim triggered the renewed violence. Following the killings and arson, the LGA Security Council on Friday, suspended the monarchs of the two kingdoms, imposed an indefinite dusk-to-dawn curfew and as well, declared the President General of Igbide, Mr Patrick Oboghor, “wanted” for failing to appear before it. The President General of Igbide is currently at large. The Police spokesperson, DSP Onome Onovwakpoyeya, confirmed the arrest of the trio in connection with the crisis, disclosing that arms and ammunition which they were “using to fight” were recovered from them.
