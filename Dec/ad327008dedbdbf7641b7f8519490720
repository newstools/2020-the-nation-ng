 MINISTER of Women Affairs and Social Development Pauline Tallen has tested positive for COVID-19. The confirmation came following tests conducted on her and her family, according to a statement made available to an online publication on Sunday. While Ms Tallen tested positive and has gone into self-isolation, other members of the family were negative. The minister said she took the test after interacting with individuals that later showed asymptomatic signs of the virus. “This is to inform the general public that after undergoing a test carried out on myself and members of my family, my result returned positive while that of members of my family tested negative,” she said. “Currently, I am asymptomatic and have gone into isolation during the period of treatment. Please keep me in your prayers and I implore you all to stay safe and observe all COVID19 protocols as we grapple with this pandemic.” She urged the public to take responsibility in order to protect the country.
