The Defence Headquarters on Sunday said troops of ‘Operation Whirl Stroke’ killed two persons and arrested one in a raid of an hideout of the late Gana’s militia gang in Katsina-Ala Local Government Area of Benue State. A statement on Sunday by the Coordinator of Defence Media Operations, Maj.-Gen. John Enenche, said the operation was in continuation of efforts to forestall banditry and other criminal activities in the North Central. He added that three locally-made rifles, 21 rounds of 7.62mm Special Ammunition and one motorcycle were recovered. The statement reads: “Troops, on December 16, raided the criminals’ location at Adangbe Village. The superior firepower of the troops forced the bandits to flee. However, two of the bandits were neutralised and one was arrested. “He has been handed over to the police for further action.”
