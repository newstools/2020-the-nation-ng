 It was a spirited effort from Quadri Aruna that salvaged the first away win as  TTC RhönSprudel Fulda-Maberzell  claimed  their fourth win in the Table Tennis Bundesliga (TTBL). The Nigerian was instrumental to  two wins from their 3-1 victory over their host TTC drawbridge Grenzau at the weekend. TTC’s Fan Bo Meng lost  3-1 to Greek Ioannis Sgouropoulos to give the host a 1-0 lead but Aruna restored parity for his team with a convincing 3-0 win over Belgian Robin Devos. Subsequently,  German international Ruwen Filus beat veteran Croat Aleksandar Karakasevic 3-1 to give the visitor a 2-1 lead. TTC had Aruna to thank  in the decisive fourth game as he fought like a Trojan to douse the in-form Greek  Sgouropoulos at 3-2 for his side’s 3-1 over all  win for  their first away win this season.  The win shot TTC to eighth spot on the TTBL table with eight points from eight matches which is made up of four wins and four loses.   A relived Aruna’s teammate, Filus said afterwards: “It was a very tight box today. My game and the last one from Aruna stood on the knife edge. I’m very happy that we didn’t have to go into the final doubles and won 3-1.”
