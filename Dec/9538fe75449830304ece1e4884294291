The Rivers State Police Command has arrested, disarmed and detained the trigger-happy policeman, who killed a commercial tricycle operator at Rukpoku area of Obio/Akpor Local Government Area of the state. The policeman caused a riot on Thursday morning when he gunned down the driver of a tricycle, Popularly called Keke NAPEP for refusing to give him N100 bribe. The protesters blocked the Rukpoku axis of the Port Harcourt International Airport and demanded the killer be released to them. There were reports that the aggrieved youths plotted to avenge the death of the victim by burning with the police station of the killer policeman. But heavy deployment of policemen in the affected area quelled the protest and dispersed the crowd. The Police Public Relations Officer of the Command, Nnamdi Omoni, a Superintendent of Police, sued for calm, promising that justice would be served. Omoni said: “I am aware of the incident at Rukpoku. One of our men killed a Keke ridder this morning. The policeman has been disarmed and he is detained now. “We have mobilised our men in the area to restore calm and contain a further breakdown of law and order. “We are pleading for calm to allow us to bring him to justice. Two wrongs can never make a wrong. The Keke driver has died and the man who killed him must receive his punishment. “Killing a policeman or burning down a station cannot bring him back to life or give him justice, instead it will deteriorate the situation.”
