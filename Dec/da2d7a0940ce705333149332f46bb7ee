Corriere della Sera via Calciomercato says that they have spotted Paul Pogba’s agent, Mino Raiola in Turin. The Italian manages some of the best players in the world and he has a good relationship with Juventus. There have been rumours of the Frenchman joining Juventus recently which makes his coming to Turin one piece of news for Juve fans to be interested in. Pogba will most likely leave Manchester United after this season and Juve is well placed to bring him back to Italy. Raiola was important in taking the Frenchman away from United to Juventus in 2012 and Pogba would go on to become a key member of the first team before returning to Old Trafford in 2016. His return to England hasn’t been as productive as he expected and he is now set to leave them again. Juventus has one of the strongest teams in Italy, but their midfield doesn’t seem to be as good as it has been in previous seasons.
