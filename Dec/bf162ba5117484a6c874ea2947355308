Barely 48 hours to the commencement of the proposed nationwide membership registration, update, and re-validation exercise of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), the party has postponed the exercise by four weeks. Initially slated to commence on Saturday, December 12, the exercise is now fixed for the second week in January 2021. The Chairman, Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Gov. Mai Mala Buni disclosed the new date to newsmen on Thursday at the party National Secretariat, in Abuja. Buni spoke through the Caretaker Committee Secretary, Senator John. James Akpanudoedehe said the postponement was to ensure a solid foundation for the exercise. According to the Chairman, “As you are all aware, the Membership Registration, Update and Revalidation Exercise of our Great Party was supposed to commence on Saturday, December 12, 2020. “On account of several factors, however, including the fast-approaching Christmas and End of Year celebrations; as well as the interest of our Christian members; and the objective of ensuring maximum participation, the CECPC has decided to shift the date of the Exercise to the second week of January 2021. “The CECPC sincerely regrets any inconveniences that may arise out of the change in date; but appeals for the understanding of the public, in the interest of preparing a solid foundation for a successful Exercise.” The Party then wished party members and the public, a peaceful and rewarding yuletide, and end of year celebration.
