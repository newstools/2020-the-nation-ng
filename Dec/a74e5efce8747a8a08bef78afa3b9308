Ijaw youths from Ogbe-Ijoh Warri urban communities in Delta State have rejected the creation of a ward in Warri South Local Government Area. They described it as ‘lopsided and unfair‘. The youths marched on the Warri-Sapele Road in peace. According to them, the Delta State Independent Electoral Commission (DSIEC) was trying to ‘deprive’ them of having a ward among those newly created. DSIEC, on Tuesday, announced the creation of over 30 wards across the state when it announced the date for the local government elections. The youths noted that the Urhobo and Itsekiri have nine and 10 wards, and accused the state of aiding the oppression their people ‘in a place occupied by three ethnic groups’. An opinion leader of Ogbe-Ijoh kingdom, Friday Deinghan, warned that if the decision is not reversed, ‘there will be unrest in the Warri metropolis’. “And we are not fighting the Itsekiri or the Urhobo; we want to fight the governor” he added. Chairman of DSIEC Mike Ogbodu said he was not aware of any such request from the Ogbe-Ijoh people. He directed our correspondent to the secretary of the commission. Chairman of Warri South did not answer his calls as at last night.
