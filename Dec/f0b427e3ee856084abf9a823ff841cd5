A group under the auspices of Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA), has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to blame himself for the spate of attacks of soft targets by series of terrorists across the country. This, HURIWA said includes the upsurge in the abduction for ransom of school children of Katsina State by terrorists. The group said the frequent rehabilitation, reintegration and the de-radicalization of arrested terrorists by the government is the reason for the spate of bloody violence and kidnapping. It went further that the releases of detained Boko haram terrorists by the government of President Muhammadu Buhari over the years: “under the guise that they are rehabilitated as repentant terrorists deserving reintegration even whilst over 2 million families displaced by these terrorists are scattered in the different dilapidated buildings and huts called internally displaced centres are neglected and denied justice for the killings of their breadwinner and loved ones, are the exact reasons for the widespread attacks by terrorists in the North of Nigeria”. HURIWA also blamed some governors especially that of Katsina State, Bello Massari for the growing social menace of armed abductions of school children, wanton sexual violations of girls and the rampant attacks of communities in Katsina State: “because the governor has been known to have publicly associated and communed with notorious terrorists also called armed bandits whom were allegedly settled by the Katsina State administration to lay down their weapons and cease fire which the terrorists never complied with”. HURIWA which faulted the claims of the Katsina State governor for choosing to call the terrorists who abducted the Government Boys Science School Studenta in Kankara Katsina state as ‘known local bandits’ also demanded that the United States of America should: “influence the United Nations Security Council to investigate the allegations that some powerful Nigerian officials and some elements in the security forces may be conniving with these terrorists to continue to maximise violence and to enable them to continue to line their pockets with the filthy lucre usually paid as ransom and financial inducements to terrorists in exchange for the release of the hostages such as the school children who are unfortunately used as bargaining chips”. According to a statement issued on Sunday by the National Coordinator, HURIWA Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko: ” We in HURIWA are amazed that Bello Masari, governor of Katsina state, could say that the abduction of some students of Government Science Secondary School, Kankara, was “conducted and executed” by local bandits, contrary to the claim of Abubakar Shekau, leader of Boko Haram. So we ask the Katsina state governor to tell Nigerians the distinction between the mass killers masquerading as Islamists and those causing mayhem, carnage, and large scale violence in the Northwest and why he thinks the latter are not terrorists?Recall that on December 11th, gunmen invaded the school, shooting into the air to scare away people in the area.As of December 13, Masari said over 300 students were confirmed missing. “On Tuesday, Shekau, in a four-minute video, said Boko Haram, whose ideology is against western education, carried out the abduction of the Katsina schoolboys. “What happened in Katsina was done to promote Islam and discourage un-Islamic practices as Western education is not the type of education permitted by Allah and his Holy Prophet,” Shekau had said in the video. But speaking on a Channels Television programme on Wednesday, the governor disagreed with the claims of Shekau, noting that information available to his administration showed that the abduction was carried out by local bandits. “The report we have and from the information available to us, this abduction was conducted and executed by local bandits that are known to all of us,” he said.“These bandits that are roaming the forest of Zamfara and parts of Katsina state, so far, this is the information we have. This dangerous sophistry and show of shame by the Katsina State governor is absolutely intolerable and unacceptable.”
