After Neymar Jr’s last statements to the ESPN microphone, where he stated that he wants to play with his former teammate Leonel Messi again, plenty of football media outlets and pundits have discussed the rumor of Lionel Messi heading to Paris Saint-Germain player next season has gained a lot of strength. While on the set of RMC Sport, French football journalist Daniel Riolo assured that Lionel Messi would go to PSG this upcoming summer. Arguing that the French team is currently the only one who can pay the salary of the six-time Ballon d’Or winner, especially if the capital club decides to sell Kylian Mbappé to Real Madrid, the 33-year-old could provide a short-term solution. “I’m very serious; Messi will be at PSG next year,” Riolo said.
