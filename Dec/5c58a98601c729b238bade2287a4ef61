The copies of the book titled: “Industrial Relations In Developing Countries” written by the late Ubeku were handed over to the university library by his wife, Dr. Beatrice. In an interview, Dr. Beatrice said she was happy to donate the book in honour of her husband  who was the first indigenous Managing Director of Guinness becaue of the opportunity it gives to educate students all over the world. “My husband was a man of integrity;  always put other people first in any endeavour he found himself.  He was a great politician and renowned philanthropist. He instituted a prize for promotion of academic excellence in Nigerian universities.  Since the 1980s, he instituted a yearly prize for the overall best graduating student in the M.S.c Programme in Industrial Relations and Personnel Management at the University of Lagos.” Mrs. Ubeku added: ‘’The late sage was  involved in the provision of scholarship for the less-privileged children towards achieving quality education up to tertiary level in Nigeria.” Kristi Omobi, a member of the organisation of WAWA, a NGO, who reviewed the book, said it is a book to help students understand industrial relations and its development. While speaking on the form and content of the book, she noted that the book would educate the students and familiarise them with  world’s industrialisation.
