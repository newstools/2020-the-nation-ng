 Recuperating  Nigeria International Victor Osimhen should be fit as fiddle come  January 20  when Napoli  battle Juventus complete with Cristiano Ronaldo  in the maiden edition of the PSP Super Cup. The FIFA Uder-17 World Cup winner and record goal scorer said on joining the Gil Azzurri in the Summer that playing against the likes of  Ronaldo  would be a dream come true for him in the Serie A. “I’m really looking forward to a new career here in Serie A; playing against the likes of Christian Ronaldo is something one can eagerly wait,” Osimhen enthused  after a record  African signing with Napoli. “It  would definitely be a whole great experience to play against Ronaldo, who is one of the greatest players on earth. So, I’m looking forward to facing him soon.” But Napoli  who amid COVID-19 protocols, failed to honour a Serie A encounter last  October, now has a new date with the Old  Lady  in the Italian Cup  to be played on January 20 at Sassuolo’s Mapei Stadium. Osimhen  has been out injured since November while on International duty with Nigeria and  was flown to Belgium on Tuesday as part of his recovery process. Words are rife that he would be ready for action after the Christmas holidays in time for the Italian Super Cup as the January 20 date  for the event  was  confirmed  yesterday by the Lega Serie A alongside Sony Interactive Entertainment Italy. It is traditionally the clash between the Serie A winners and Coppa Italia holders, played on neutral turf. Usually this is at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, but as it’ll probably be behind closed doors anyway, the venue is moved to the Mapei Stadium in Reggio Emilia. PlayStation 5 are now  sponsoring the competition, so it will be named the PS5 Supercup.
