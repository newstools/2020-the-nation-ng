Civil Society organisations (CSOs) – Connected Development (CODE) and Oxfam in Nigeria – have called for transparency in COVID-19 spending by governments. This is just as CODE said it tracked COVID-19 funds totalling N96.7 billion using its advocacy platform, “Follow The Money” in 10 states. Oxfam in Nigeria Communication Officer Maryam Laushi, at a town hall meeting on COVID-19 spending in Abuja, said it is important for Nigerians to know how the monies contributed were spent and where it went to. Miss Laushi said Oxfam is working with CODE to ensure that both state and federal governments are accountable and transparent in regards to the monies received and spent on the COVID-19 pandemic. Giving a breakdown of the figures, CODE’s Chief Executive Officer Hamzat Lawal said “Follow The Money” tracked N1.4 billion in Edo; N1.4 billion in Ondo; N94 million in Bauchi; N28 million in Borno; N230 million in Kwara; N378 million in Oyo; N2.3 billion in Kano and N330 million in Enugu. Others are: N28 million in Akwa Ibom and N12.6 billion in Lagos State. Lawal said there were lack of data on contracting information and the various beneficiaries of these resources in the states.
