 A ThIrty-five-year-old woman, Mrs. Comfort Innocent, has confessed that she trafficked teenagers from Nigeria to Italy through the crisis-ridden Libya for prostitution.

Police spokesman Abimbola Oyeyemi, who disclosed this in a statement, said the suspect had admitted during interrogation to being a human trafficker, who had been in the business for a long time. Abimbola, a Deputy Superintendent  of Police (DSP), quoted the suspect as saying that her husband, who is based in Italy, receives the girls, while she stays in Nigeria recruiting young girls and sending them to Italy en route Libya. He said the two girls the suspect abducted were taken to Kaduna State, from where they would be transported to Libya, adding that they had, however, been rescued in Kaduna State by the police.
