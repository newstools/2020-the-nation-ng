The district head of Yakila in Rafi local government area of Niger state, Alhaji Ibrahim Abdulhamid, a nurse, and a businessman have been abducted by unknown gunmen. The attack occurred at about 2:00 am on Thursday. A Source told The Nation that over 20 gunmen invaded the village in motorcycles shooting sporadically into the air to scare off any attempt of anyone to intervene. Several of the villagers are said to have run into the bush for their safety. The raid lasted for two hours as the gunmen looted houses; beat up some of the villagers before going away with their victims. No life was recorded to have been lost. This is coming barely a few days after gunmen attacked the home of another district head in Pandu Gari but met his absence. Enraged over not meeting their target, the gunmen burnt down his palace and the food barns of the people in the village. The Director-General of the Niger State Emergency Management Agency (NSEMA), Alhaji Ibrahim Inga confirmed the attack but said that the details are not yet clear. “We will get the details and get back to you,” Inga said.
