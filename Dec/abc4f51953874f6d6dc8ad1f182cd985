 A BARBER in Kano State, Isa Sulaiman, 26, yesterday made many tongues to wag as he married his American lover, 46-year-old Janine Sanchez Riemann. The wedding was held according to Islamic teachings in Kano at Police College Juma’a Mosque, Gasau, along Panshekara road. Senator Shehu Sani was among the guests. It was gathered that the Imam of the Mosque, Adam Abubakar, joined the two to become one, after the bridegroom paid N50, 000 bride price. The couple fell in love after meeting on social media platform, Instagram. Ms Reimann, a mother of two, revealed the relationship started when Sulaiman observed and warned a scammer who attempted to defraud her via the social media. “I didn’t respond because I have had experiences with Nigerian scammers. “There was a guy messaging me and Sulaiman knew he was a scammer. So he reacted, telling him to go get a job and quit scamming innocent people. So, I thought he sounded like a nice guy,” the bride, a chef in California, said. Sulaiman, an indigene of Niger State residing in Kano, said he had always dreamt about marrying a white and fathering mixed race kids. The groom, formerly in love with Nafisa Tahir -an Hausa girl, said  his dream came true when the white woman responded to his message. The two continued exchanging messages and early this year, the American flew to Kano. Sulaiman’s father, Isa, a retired policeman, said he approved of his son’s union with the American woman as long as she allows him to remain a Muslim. The bride will be taking Isah to the US to sponsor his education, after few months of honeymoon in Kano, the family said. Senator Sani said the marriage is an indication that ethnicity, race and religion are not a barrier to intending couples. He advised the couple to set a good example for Nigerian youths.
