Despite whipping Roma 4-0 in Serie A tie at the weekend, Coach Rino Gattuso of Napoli has admitted that the team missed the services of Nigeria International Victor Osimhen in their line-up. The coach who attributed Napoli’s display against Roma to the mentality of the players. “I like today’s mentality, when a teammate makes a mistake, he applauds and doesn’t say a fuck. I want the knife between my teeth, always,” Gattuso told Sky Sport.“We have missed Osimhen in recent weeks, remember, he is an important player,” he added.  Gattuso described the death of Diego Maradona as sad especially for Napoli where the Argentine helped the team to Serie A title in the 1980s. He said:  “The air is sad but the city must have common sense. I see too many people without masks, we all know that it is a legend but we have to be good because otherwise we will all pay the consequences. “ I understand the affection but from tomorrow we have to do things properly, the city is suffering a lot.”
