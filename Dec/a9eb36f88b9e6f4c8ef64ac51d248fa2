Antonio Conte told Inter Milan fans on Saturday he needed time to turn Inter Milan into “a skyscraper” in European football. Inter’s season in Europe is over after finishing bottom of their Champions League group, a third consecutive financially-damaging exit in the first round. “The fact that the league and Coppa Italia are all that remain for us is painful for me,” Conte told a press conference before Sunday’s Serie A game against Cagliari. “Our elimination from the Champions League burns and those who know me know how I’m feeling about it.  “I want to send a message to Inter fans, we’re not giving in to those who hope to destroy what we are trying to create after a year and a half of work. “There is too much negativity, even if I understand that there is impatience after ten years without trophies. “But we started from the ground up, we need time. Once the base has been built, one can think of the skyscraper, the kind Inter fans deserve.” Inter are second in Serie A, five points behind leaders AC Milan. The 18-time champions have not won the league since 2010, having finished runners-up last season.
