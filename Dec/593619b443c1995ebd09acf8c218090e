 The 2020 National Anti-Corruption Marathon Race initially scheduled for December 19 has been postponed . The postponement, according to organisers, is coming on the heels of rising cases of COVID-19 in the country. In a  statement made available by Jacob Onu, the National Coordinator of the Marathon Race and CEO of Fairplay Sports International ,said the body was influenced by the recent advisory by  Presidential Task Force  guidelines on COVID-19. Onu said: “We have had a successful Annual Youths and Students Summit on the National Anti-Corruption Marathon. The race is the last leg but I’m saddened by the sudden rise of COVID-19 cases in the country. “We cannot jeopardize the health of our athletes and citizens. It’s quite unfortunate but  We will keep the public updated on the revised date of the race pending when it is safe for large gatherings. “ It would be recalled that the second edition of the race was won by Emmanuel Gyang and Deborah Pam Gyang in male and female categories and went home with the N1m prize money respectively.
