MANCHESTER United and Manchester City will reportedly battle for Erling Haaland’s signature in the summer transfer window. United have long been linked with Haaland, while City are closely monitoring the prolific Borussia Dortmund striker as they prepare for Sergio Aguero’s Etihad exit. Haaland, 20, is arguably the most exciting talent in Europe and has scored 33 goals in 32 games since joining Dortmund in January.  The Norway international had suitors from across Europe, including United, before leaving RB Salzburg for the Bundesliga giants. The Red Devils remain keen on the player, who has started the season in scintillating form with 17 goals in 14 appearances.
