Pope Francis on Friday urged the countries of the world to assist one another in the fight against coronavirus by making its vaccines available for all. “Today, in this time of darkness and uncertainty during the pandemic, different lights of hope appear, like the discovery of the vaccines … they must be available to everyone,” the Pope said during his traditional Urbi et Orbi (to the city and the world) message at the Vatican. “I beg all those in charge of states, of companies, of international bodies … to promote cooperation and not competition and to seek a solution for everyone, vaccines for all, especially for the most vulnerable and needy in all regions of the globe.” Pope Francis called for “generosity and support,” particularly towards those experiencing unemployment, hardship and domestic violence during the pandemic. He spoke from the Vatican Apostolic Palace — as opposed to his balcony overlooking St. Peter’s Square, where he traditionally issues the address from.
