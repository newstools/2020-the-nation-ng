In 2020, Davido was in the news all through. From the first quarter to the last quarter, he was in the news for one thing or the other. In the first quarter, Davido trended after cutting short the tour of his sophomore album, A Good Time. He returned to Nigeria alongside his father, sisters, and brothers to stay together during the COVID-19 lockdown in Nigeria. As the second quarter began, Davido’s fiancee, Chioma Rowland, tested positive for COVID-19. He stood firm to be with his wife and son throughout the process that lasted three weeks. As the second quarter was winding down, Davido announced his decision to get off social media for a month after acquiring a new home on Banana Island. The singer and music producer used the opportunity to complete his third album, A Better Time. He ended up staying off social media and changed his direct phone number for two months. In the third quarter, Davido returned to social media and began making props for the release of his third album. As the third quarter neared an end, the EndSARS protest began and the singer took a leading role. He immersed himself in the protest and even went as far as getting to the Police IG’s office. After the protest, Davido released his third album, A Better Time. As his album kept climbing the chat, Davido lost his 5-year bodyguard. Shortly after, he announced his decision to play the important role of the best man at his gateman’s wedding.
