IT is a battle of Nigeria wingers at Club Brugge and it appears David Okereke will start ahead of Emmanuel Dennis for the Belgian champions in a must-win UEFA Champions League tie at Lazio. Club Brugge have to win at Lazio tomorrow night so as to advance to the Round of 16 of the Champions League and not play in the UEFA Europa League. At the weekend, Okereke replaced his teammate and compatriot to become the match winner against Saint-Truiden. Club Brugge coach Philippe Clement will go on to praise Okereke while hinting on giving him more game time. Okereke was bought as a deep striker from Italian club Spezia last year summer, but the coach has since deployed him as a winger. “I don’t care where I play,” Okereke insisted after his second goal in the league this season. “I am a versatile player who can easily switch between positions. The trainer has to decide where is best to play me.”
