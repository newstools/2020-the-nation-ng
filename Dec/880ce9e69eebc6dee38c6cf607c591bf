Tyson Fury has looked to further rile rival Anthony Joshua by claiming his fellow Brit would make the easiest opponent of all boxers who have called him out. Fury remains desperate to meet AJ in the ring and bring the world of boxing the showdown it craves more than all others. Both men have repeatedly talked up the encounter, which is tipped to become the showpiece boxing event of 2021. Speaking in  an interview on the Wow Hydrate Youtube channel, Fury outlined how he feels AJ is the perfect opponent out there for him. “The easiest opponent I think would be Anthony Joshua just because he’s tailor-made for me,” Fury explained. “If ever I could build a perfect opponent I’d be building him.”  Joshua is in line to defend his WBA, IBF and WBO belts against Kubrat Pulev on December 12. Victory over the big Bulgarian would ensure Joshua remains on course to meet Fury and take on the glamorous showdown fight at the pinnacle of the sport. Meanwhile, WBC champion Fury has received support from WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman in his pursuit of an undisputed world title fight against Joshua. The British rivals want to fight for all the world heavyweight belts next year, provided that they overcome current challenges inside and outside the ring. “Tyson Fury is our champion, our pride. Anthony Joshua holds the other belts and he has been a tremendous asset to the sport. A gentleman, a great career. “To see this showdown, Fury-Joshua, would be tremendous for everyone in the sport of boxing. We will absolutely support it.”
