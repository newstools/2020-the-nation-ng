Yet-to-be-ascertained number of passengers of Abuja-bound commercial bus were Tuesday kidnapped on the ever-busy Benin-Auchi Road in Edo State. The bus left Benin early Tuesday morning and the driver was heading for Abuja, but rampaging hoodlums intercepted the bus at gunpoint, between Ehor and Iruekpen in Edo state, thereby shooting sporadically into the air. Sources revealed last night that many of the helpless passengers were moved into the forest. As at press time, the victims were still guests of the kidnappers in their den. Efforts to get the Eâ€Ždo Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Chidi Nwabuzor, a Superintendent of Police (SP), was unsuccessful as he is not taking his calls and yet to respond to text and WhatsApp messages sent to him.
