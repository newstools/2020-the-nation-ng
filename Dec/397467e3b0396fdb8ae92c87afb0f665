Kaduna State Governor Malam Nasir El-Rufai has pledged the implementation of the 2021 budget, to deliver on the government’s promises and sustain the 98 per cent capital budget implementation recorded in 2019. The governor, who also promised to continue the huge strides in infrastructural development recorded in 2020, hailed the House of Assembly for consistently passing the budget ahead of the end of the preceding year. He spoke on Wednesday after signing the 2021 budget of the state, at a short ceremony attended by Deputy Governor Hadiza Balarabe, House of Assembly Speaker Yusuf Zailani and senior officials from the legislative and executive arms of the government. El-Rufai said: “It is my privilege today to sign the 2021 Budget of the Kaduna State Government into law as passed by the House of Assembly. I thank the Assembly for consistently passing next year’s budget way ahead of the end of the preceding financial year.’’ He said the implementation of the 2021 budget will begin on January 1, adding that ”this is an unprecedented achievement. We are the only government that has for years, without fail, started its budget on January 1.” The governor attributed the consistency to the hard work of officials of the government, who prepared the budget and the dedication and commitment of the members and leadership of the House of Assembly. He said the government has pressed ahead with its comprehensive programme to develop and modernise its infrastructure, despite the negative impact and slowdown caused by COVID-19 pandemic. Said he:  “Even with this pandemic, Kaduna State has continued to make huge strides in infrastructural development as well as expanding on our health system, to deal with this kind of emergency.’’ El-Rufai said the focus on improving infrastructure, strengthening health sector resilience and making lives better in the state would next year continue with a determined focus.
