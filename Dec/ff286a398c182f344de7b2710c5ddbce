A woman simply identified as Mrs. Chinagorom Frank and her son whose names could not be immediately ascertained have reportedly regained their freedom. Mrs. Frank and her seven months old son were last weeks kidnapped by gunmen operating on a motorbike at Ozata in Etiti Asa community in Ukwa West Local Area of the state, after an attempt to kidnap the husband; Mr. Chinagorom Frank failed. The information has it that the gunmen, who started negotiation for the release of their victims with the family members barely 24hrs after kidnapping them, demanded N10m ransom and later released the victims after agreeing to collect the sum of N400, 000. A source in the community who chose to speak anonymously told our correspondent that the kidnappers warned Frank that he stands the chance of losing both his wife and son if he involves police or any of the security agencies during the negotiation process. A security agent who spoke anonymously confirmed the release of the victims but denied knowledge of payment for ransom. The victims have reportedly rejoined their family members, The Nation gathered.
