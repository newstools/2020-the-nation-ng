 THE All Progressives Congress (APC) in Enugu State has rejected the outcome of the December 5 Isiuzo State Constituency election. The conduct of the election followed the death of the former member representing the constituency, Mr. Chijioke Ugwueze. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declared the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) candidate and wife of the deceased lawmaker, Mrs. Amaka Ugwueze, as the winner of the election. But members of the APC in Isiuzo Local Government Area on Monday staged a peaceful protest at the INEC office in Enugu. One of the leaders of the protesters, Chief Chinedu Jideofo-Ogbuagu, said the outcome of the poll contradicted how the electorate cast their ballots. Also, the APC candidate in the election, McDonald Okwo, said the poll was not free and fair. INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) Emeka Ononamadu said he was surprised at the protest. “Why are they protesting? Their agents were there when the results were released,” Ononamadu said.
