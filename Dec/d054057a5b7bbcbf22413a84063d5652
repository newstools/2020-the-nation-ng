The police in Rivers State have sealed a brothel on Azikiwe Street, Mile 2 Diobu, Port Harcourt, where Enuduisu Odili (40) reportedly died during a sex romp with a commercial sex worker. Odili allegedly died after checking in on Thursday night. He was found dead on Friday morning after a marathon sex with the lady. His family alleged foul play and demanded a thorough investigation. Odili’s younger brother, Chukwuemeka, appealed to the Commissioner of Police, Joseph Mukan, to unearth the circumstances behind his brother’s death. He said: “We received the news on December 4 but we suspect foul play between the hotel management and the suspect, which is why we call on Commissioner of Police and other security agencies to unravel the mystery surrounding our brother’s death. We want justice for our brother.” The police has cordoned off the brothel to facilitate investigations and forestall a possible breach of peace. Spokesman Nnamdi Omoni said investigations have begun, adding that the matter has been transferred to the state Criminal Investigation Department. Omoni said: “The place was temporarily sealed to forestall a breakdown of law and order or damage to the facility. The manager is in our custody, the prostitute in whose room the man died is also with us and investigation is on. The matter has been transferred to state CID.”
