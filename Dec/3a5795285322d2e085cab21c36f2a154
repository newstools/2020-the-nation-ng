Justice Olabisi Akinlade of the Ikeja High Court on Tuesday refused to hear the post-conviction bail application of popular televangelist Israel Ogundipe (aka Genesis). Justice Akinlade dismissed the application brought pursuant to Section 6(6) of the 1999 Constitution as amended. The decision means the convict will remain in the custody of the Kirikiri Correctional facility. A motion on notice for bail pending appeal, filed by Genesis’ lawyer, Olanrewaju Ajanaku, asked the court for an order admitting the applicant to bail unconditionally pending the hearing and determination of his appeal. In his 16 paragraph affidavit, Genesis affirmed being a diabetic and could not follow strict diet and constant specialised medical attention which has taken a toll on his health. He added that he suffers from hypertension, peptic ulcer and unending malaria which had worsened since his conviction on November 18. The state, in its counter affidavit deposed to by Rotimi Odutola, prayed the court to refuse the application. It said: “There was never a time the convict complained about his state of health during trial, only for him to allude to facts about his alleged state of health now that he has been in custody for barely three weeks.” Justice Akinlade held that Genesis did not prove any special circumstances that could persuade the court to grant him bail. He said: “The convict has not shown any medical records of his illness. He has also not been to the prison hospital for treatment so his appeal can be heard early.” Justice Akinlade on November 18 convicted Genesis for conversion of property and stealing.
