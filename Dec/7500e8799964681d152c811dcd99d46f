Gunmen on Monday night killed Moses Udam and his wife in Agboughul, Makurdi, Benue State. Udam was killed on his birthday. Makurdi Branch Chairman of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) Justine Gbagir, who confirmed the murder, said he was in Abuja when he got the news. Gbagir said he was told gunmen stormed the Udam’s house about 11:30pm on Monday. The sister who lives with them also sustained injuries. This is the second killing within three weeks. Gunmen reportedly killed a lecturer, Karl Kwaghnger, some weeks back. As at last night, there were rumours that suspected herdsmen might have killed the lawyer and his wife in a case of mistaken identity. The killers were said to be after a livestock guard who has allegedly impounded about 2,000 cows since the Anti-Open Grazing Prohibition Law came into force. Last Friday, suspected herdsmen stormed the area and killed four persons. Seven others sustained injuries and are receiving treatment in the hospital. Gbagir condemned the killing and called on security agencies to arrest the perpetrators. Police spokesman Kate Anene confirmed the incident and said officers have been deployed in the area. She added that two persons were killed and one is receiving treatment at the Benue State University Teaching Hospital, Makurdi. Governor Samuel Ortom has said the state will not succumb to attacks by terrorists. He addressed reporters yesterday when he visited Agboughul. According to Ortom, the pattern of the attack and killings, barely four days after a similar incident at Tse-Angbande, was unfortunate and ‘bore the handwriting of mindless jihadists who are out to overrun the state’. The governor noted that the attacks were a grand plan to whittle down operations of Livestock Guards and Agro Rangers who are doing well in containing attacks on communities and enforcing the ranching law.
