Nigerian equities regained the global lead as the most-rewarding stocks, after rising for five consecutive trading sessions to close weekend with net capital gains of N1.33 trillion. Nigeria’s sovereign equities indices at the weekend indicated average return of 7.46 per cent for the week, equivalent to net capital gain of N1.33 trillion. Gains by Nigerian stocks considerably surpassed average returns across the global advanced and emerging markets. The five-day sustained rally pushed average year-to-date return for Nigerian equities to 37.12 per cent, setting up Nigeria for a top position in global returns for 2020. Global stock analysis showed a generally positive sentiment as hopes on crude oil deals, fiscal stimulus and COVID-19 vaccines tickled the markets from America to Europe, Asia, Middle East and Africa. In United States of America, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) rose by 0.9 per cent while the S & P appreciated by 1.6 per cent. In United Kingdom, the FTSE 100 posted a modest return of 0.1 per cent while Japan’s Nikkei 225 appreciated by 0.4 per cent. The MSCI EM Index, which tracks emerging markets, rose by 1.2 per cent while the MSCI FM Index, which tracks frontier markets, appreciated by 0.9 per cent. The All Share Index (ASI)- the value-based common index that tracks all share prices at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) closed weekend at 36,804.75 points as against its week’s opening index of 34,250.74 points. The ASI doubles as Nigeria’s sovereign equities index. Aggregate market value of all quoted equities on the NSE crossed two trillion marks to close weekend at a high of N19.236 trillion compared with its opening value of N17.902 trillion for the week. With three advancers for every decliner, the positive overall market position at the Nigerian equities market was driven by widespread bargain-hunting across the sectors, especially within the active large and mid cap stocks. The NSE 30 Index, which tracks the 30 largest stocks on the Exchange, posted average return of 5.47 per cent. The NSE Banking Index, which tracks the most active and influential banking sector, also recorded average return of 5.12 per cent. The NSE Insurance Index-riding on the bubbles of recapitalisation, mergers and acquisitions, posted the highest gain of 13.39 per cent. The NSE Industrial Goods Index, where the largest cement companies are listed, rose by 7.74 per cent, a major influence on the overall market given the capitalisation of the sector. The NSE Consumer Goods Index rose by 3.08 per cent while the NSE Oil and Gas Index recorded average gain of 1.34 per cent for the week. Most analysts believe Nigerian equities still have headroom for further gains, citing comparative yields and valuations across domestic assets and global markets. “We anticipate a sustained bullish performance in the coming week as investors position in undervalued stocks,” Afrinvest Securities stated in a weekend note on market outlook. Analysts at Cordros Securities said there was still scope for expansion in share prices in the meantime as the hunt for alpha-yielding opportunities, in the face of increasingly negative real returns in the fixed income market, remains positive for stocks. “However, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro environment remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings,” Cordros Securities stated.
