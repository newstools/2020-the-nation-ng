 Worried by the widespread insecurity across the country, Ijaw Elders’ Consultative Forum has reiterated its commitment to work with the critical stakeholders in the Niger Delta region to ensure the safety of lives and property of its people. In a communique jointly signed by Rear Admiral O.P Fingesi (rtd); Mrs. Mutu-Bamuza, T.K Ogoriba; Solomon Leggjack; Chief Atamunu Atamunu and Efiye Bribena at the end of its meeting held at Hotel Presidential, Port Harcourt, Rivers State the group noted with concern the perceived militarization of the region as well as the rising tension, stressing the need for collaborative effort to promote community-based initiative on the security. The statement reads in part: “The meeting discussed the state of security in the Niger Delta and hereby reiterates the commitment of the Ijaw to work with other neighbours to protect our territories at the South-South regional level, using community and people-based initiative which had worked effectively in times past.” This is even as the elders lamented the neglect of infrastructures in the Niger Delta, especially the East-West road, environmental degradation, attendant loss of means livelihood as well as inadequate representation of its people in the scheme of things, declaring that “the hen that lays the proverbial golden eggs can no longer accept to be treated with such neglect.” It added: “The Ijaw also suffer disadvantage as it pertains to the existing fiscal regime and revenue allocation which is at total variance with the original allocation formula adopted by our Founding Fathers at the inception of Federal Government of Nigeria.” While calling of the Federal Government to do a total overhaul of the existing structure to ensure fairness and justice, the coalition group decried the sudden removal of Director General, National Agency for the Prevention of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), Mrs Julie Donli-Okah, and Secretary of the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC), Mr. Elvis Oglafa, without any justifiable.
