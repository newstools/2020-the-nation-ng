 BEFORE the coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent lockdown, actress, and movie producer, Joy Tambou has always craved an additional income to make bigger budget films. For a while now, Tambou who has featured in such movies as Sleepless Romance, Bedroom secret, Unavoidable Blunder, Mr. Ibu the Campus Lecturer, Duty Post, Regina Desperate for Movie Role, Unwise King among others has been missing in action. It was gathered that she is now into network marketing. She is a top representative of Longrich bioscience, a Chinese Global manufacturing conglomerate. Asked why she left acting to go into network marketing, Tambou who produced flicks like Tattered and Diary of a Corper said: “Acting is in the blood. I can never leave acting for anything. But then, in this industry today so many actors are broke because the industry doesn’t give a gratuity. Once you are not on the screen there is nothing for you. I know acting can never give me much money as I am making now.” Continuing, she said, “I hate network marketing before now because of the way I thought it was until I saw my brother’s earnings in seven-figure digits as well as my mother. I know with network marketing I can build to retire early. I choose network marketing because I want to give my kids a better life. All my life is on it. I have a dream to shoot blockbuster movies. “So, I am partnering with Longrich so that I can have the finance to sponsor my movies without begging or sleeping around to get it.” Well-endowed Tambou hinted that she would be fully back in Nollywood as she is already working on some scripts.
