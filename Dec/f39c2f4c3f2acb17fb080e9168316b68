The Abia State Rapid Respond Squad (RRS) has rescued two children in Lagos and Rivers states. The child syndicate, specialised in abducting children of two to three years, luring them with biscuits and sweet, was busted in Imo and Enugu states at the weekend. One of the kids, Marvelous Monday, was stolen in Abia State. Commander of the RRS Johnbull Obioguru said Master Marvelous was rescued in Lagos while the second child was rescued in Port Harcourt on December 12. According to him, Marvelous has been handed over to her parents while the second child does not know his name or his parents’, community or last contact address because he was abducted at a tender age.
