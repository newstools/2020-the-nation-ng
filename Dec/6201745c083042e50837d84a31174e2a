 THE Federal Polytechnic Offa, Kwara State, has expelled Oladipo Juwon, a Higher National Diploma (HND) 1 student who was convicted of internet fraud. Juwon, a Business Administration student, was last week sentenced to prison or a N250,000 fine by the State High Court in Ilorin. A statement by the polytechnic’s spokesperson, Olayinka Iroye, said the Students’ Disciplinary Committee’s reports recommended Juwon for expulsion. The statement reads: “The polytechnic has also expelled him from the institution following the students’ disciplinary committee’s reports which found him guilty, though he pleaded for leniency. “The offence violates the polytechnic’s code of conduct as clearly stated in the students’ information and regulations handbook section 18.2.1 subsection (ix). “The management upholds its stand against cyber and internet fraud, cultism, hooliganism and other vices, and will sanction erring students in accordance with the polytechnic rules and regulations. “Students are therefore enjoined to be of good behaviour and conduct themselves accordingly.”
