SIR: Before Samuel Ortom’s election as governor of Benue State, Fulani herdsmen had been killing in Benue and Ortom was aware. He came in as the governor and declared amnesty. The youth in the state including the late Terwase Agwaza, honoured the amnesty programme and surrendered their arms. The killings by herdsmen were still going on in the state at the time of amnesty. Yet, the Governor still threatened that anyone who refused to surrender his or her arms during the amnesty programme, such will be dealt with if seen with arms after the amnesty. The same Governor is now calling on the same people he once ordered to surrender their arms  that they should defend themselves against Fulani herdsmen. To defend themselves with what? With the arms he collected from them through amnesty, or he is going to return the arms to them? You  disarmed people, and now you are pushing them to face well-armed vampires that have acquired special trainings on genocide. How do you expect them to function? Is this not confusion? The governor that is calling on the people to defend themselves still owes their salaries and retirement benefits. Without the money, what should the people’s use to acquire the needed things for defence? Or they should use stones and firewood against the herdsmen that carry AK 47 and other gigantic weapons? I am not against the idea of people defending themselves against the herdsmen in the state, especially now that is obvious to see the powerlessness of Government, both at the federal, state and local levels. I am just worried that the Governor may wake up tomorrow and call on the same people to surrender their arms or be dealt with by the police and army that are powerless when it comes to facing herdsmen and other domestic terrorists,  but become powerful when they confront IPOB, #EndSars protesters and other innocent citizens.
