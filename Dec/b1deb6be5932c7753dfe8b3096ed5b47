A Federal High Court in Abuja has granted leave to two groups to apply for judicial review and order of mandamus to compel the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor to, among others, provide details of financial donations received by the country in relation to the coronavirus pandemic. Justice Inyang Ekwo, in a ruling on Monday, also granted them permission to seek an order for the court to declare that the failure of the CBN to provide the plaintiff information on the sources of the donations, how they are being applied, among others, amounted to a violation of the plaintiff’s rights under the Freedom of Information Act and the African Chatter on Human and People’s Rights. The ruling was on an ex-parte motion filed by the Registered Trustees of Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) and HEDA Resource Centre, in a suit with the CBN Governor listed as sole respondent. Justice Ekwo ordered the plaintiff to file, within seven days, a formal application for the orders sought, which it must serve on the respondent within seven days. The judge ordered the respondent to, upon being served, file its response within 30 days. The reliefs the applicants seeks to apply for includes an order compelling the CBN Governor to “disclose and make a comprehensive breakdown of financial donations received towards responding to the emergence of COVID 19 tilt date”. The applicants said “it is widely reported that about N15 billion in monetary contributions, is currently in the account set up under the Private Sector Coalition Against COVID19 (CACOVID) and domiciled with the respondent”.
