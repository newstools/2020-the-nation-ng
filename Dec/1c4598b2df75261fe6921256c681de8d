Ben Adaji Jalingo The Taraba Police Command on Monday foiled an attempt by unknown gunmen to abduct a Chinese national in Gidin Dorowa area of Wukari local government area of the state. DSP David Misal, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) of the command who disclosed this in Jalingo on Tuesday said the armed men had blocked the Wukari-Jalingo highway on Monday night and were about to kidnap a Chinese national on transit but were repelled by the police. Misal said that one of the suspected kidnappers was killed in the bloody gun battle that ensued between the criminals and the police while others escaped with gun wounds. “The Taraba State Police Command successfully killed one of the kidnapping gang members terrorising Wukari Jalingo road and recovered one AK47 with two magazines loaded with 60 rounds of ammunition. “The incident occurred exactly at Gindin Dorowa, Wukari LGA when the kidnappers numbering about eight blocked the highway and attempted to kidnap a Chinese national. Consequently, they engaged the policemen in a shoot-out and the superior firepower of our policemen led to the killing of one of the kidnappers while others escaped with gun wounds,” the statement read in part. The Nation reports that the Wukari-Jalingo highway has become a death trap for travelers who either fall victim to tribal militia or armed groups who block the road to rob or kidnap people. It could be recalled that recently, Mr. Danlami Shamaki the proprietor of Winners Comprehensive Secondary School Jalingo was killed on the road in a failed kidnapping attempt while several other innocent travellers have lost their lives to the activities of criminals on Jalingo Wukari road in the past six months.
