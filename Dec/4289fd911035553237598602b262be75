The Chairman, Senate Committee on Army, Senator Mohammed Ali Ndume (Borno South), on Friday, described a former Chairman of the Pension Reform Task Team (PRTT), Abdulrasheed Maina as “untrustworthy.” Ndume was recently remanded on account of standing surety for Maina, who is presently standing trial on fraud charges at a Federal High Court, Abuja. Justice Okon Abang had ordered the remand of Ndume at the Kuje Custodial Centre after  Maina jumped bail and subsequently fled the country. Maina was extradited back to the country to face trial after he was arrested in Niger Republic by men of the Nigeria Police Force and other security operatives. Ndume, who spoke to reporters in Abuja, said he will instruct his lawyers to commence the process of withdrawing his suretyship of Maina. He commended the Inspector General of Police and other security operatives who carried out the arrest and extradition of Maina. Ndume said, “I commend the Nigeria Police Force for executing the bench warrant issued on Maina by the Federal High Court in Abuja. “This has shown that the NPF is not a write off. They are professionals under the able leadership of the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu. “With the successful arrest, extradition and subsequent remand of Maina at the Kuje Correctional Centre, I will proceed to direct my legal team to begin the process of withdrawing my suretyship for Maina with immediate effect because his action has shown that he is not trustworthy” The Borno South lawmaker also thanked all Nigerians especially members of the National Assembly, the political class, family and friends, who showed serious concern when the court moved against him after Maina fled the country
