Just as we were about to put this column to bed a terse clarification on the origin of Wale “Wally” Adeyemo, the US Deputy Treasury Secretary designate, came from Prince Adelani Oyediran Ajanaku. It reads in parts: I Prince Adelani Oyediran Ajanaku wish to congratulate our Royal Majesty Oba (Dr) Adetoyese Oyeniyi, the Olufi of Gbonganland, the High Chiefs, the titled chiefs and the eminent Gbongan sons and daughters at home and abroad over the good news of one of our illustrious indigenes, Mr Adewale Adeyemo who has just been nominated by the USA president-elect, Mr Joe Biden as the Deputy Secretary of Treasury. This is sweet and glorious news for our town that deserves huge commendation and accolades. Let’s get our facts straight. Pa Adeyemo (Great Grandpa) migrated from Modakeke during the war between Ife/ Modakeke in 1909 and Pa Adeyemo gave birth to Pa Akanbi Adeyemo who gave birth to  Dr Adekanmi Joseph Adeyemo that gave birth to Wale Adeyemo. His mother is from Inisa town {in Odo Otin Local Government) named Florence Olajire Adeyemo. When both the great grandpa and grandma died, they were buried in Gbongan while also grandma and grandpa Akanbi                              Adeyemo  were buried in Gbongan. I can take you to his family house and the burial ground in front of their house till today. By the way Gbongan, Modakeke and Odeomu are triplets intertwined historically. Omo gbogbo wan ni oooo. Prince Adelani Oyediran Ajanaku.
