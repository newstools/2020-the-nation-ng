 GLOBAL Finance has named Access Bank the ‘Safest Bank’ in Nigeria in 2020. This is part of the platform’s 29th yearly World’s Safest Banks rankings. The recognition followed the bank’s efforts towards ensuring the protection of customer funds and data. Global Finance’s rankings of the World’s safest banks has been the recognised and trusted standard of financial counter-party safety for more than a quarter-century. The safest banks by country were selected through an evaluation of long-term foreign currency ratings – from Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch – and the total assets of the 1000 largest banks worldwide. Chief Executive Officer of Access Bank Plc, Herbert Wigwe, said: “Throughout 2020, financial institutions all over the world have been faced with peculiarities in safeguarding the finances and data of customers. “Through this Access Bank has remained steadfast in its commitment to ensuring that the finances of customers are protected and the data confidentiality of all stakeholders are maintained. This recognition serves as an encouragement for us to build on our successes and invest even more in digitally-led measures that will position us as the World’s Most Respected African bank.” Also, the Publisher and Editorial Director of Global Finance, Joseph Giarraputo, said: “For most of 2020, the world has been lashed by the COVID-19 pandemic, a steep drop in economic activity and, in some cases, serious social unrest. Any of these developments could have significantly impacted banks’ credit worthiness. Surprisingly, however, the relative position of the world’s largest banks on Global Finance’s World’s Safest Banks 2020 lists has been mostly stable.
