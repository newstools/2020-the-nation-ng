 THE Senate on Thursday deferred the passage of the 2021 budget till Monday, next week. Senate President Ahmad Lawan, who made this known at plenary, said the development followed new items of expenditure transmitted to the National Assembly by the Executive. He said the Committee on Finance would work through the weekend to capture the fresh requests from the executive in their 2021 Appropriation Bill report. He said the Senate would hold a special session next Monday to consider and pass the 2021 budget. Following the development, the reports of the 2021-2023 Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and Fiscal Strategy Paper (FSP) as well as the 2021 Appropriation Bill 2020 earlier scheduled for presentation and consideration were deferred. Lawan said: “There was a late request for some more expenditure from the executive arm of government and we want to ensure our committee produces a very clean document so they can’t present this report today.
