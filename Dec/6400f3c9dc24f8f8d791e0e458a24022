The Lagos State Water Regulatory Commission (LSWRC) has concluded plans to equip drillers, table and sachet water producers and water tanker operators with skills to provide safe drinking water for all. The Executive Secretary of LSWRC, Mrs Funke Adepoju, who disclosed this in a statement made available to reporters, said the workshop for key stakeholders in the industry was aimed at preparing the operators to align with the commitment of government to protect residents from using unhygienic water. According to her, the initiative is in line with the vision of the state government to ensure international best practices in water abstraction, production and supply. She said although the commission had the mandate to enforce relevant laws relating to abstraction, production and supply of water, it was, however, going a step further to properly enlighten operators in the industry on best practices, in order to ward off the conflict of interests and ensure that stakeholders are working towards the same goal of protecting consumers. “Our focus with this workshop for Drillers, Table and Sachet Water Producers as well as Water Tanker Operators in Lagos State is to ensure that we, both the Commission and operators, are on the same page. “Yes, we have the mandate to enforce relevant laws with regards to their operation but we want to get their buy-in because our principal focus is safety of consumers. “Essentially, we are organising a two-day workshop for these stakeholders on “Best Drilling Practices for Sustainable Development in Lagos State; Safe Water for Lagos: Responding To Urban Challenges; and Safe Delivery of Potable Water In Lagos: Role of Water Tanker Operators in The Delivery of Drinkable Water,” Adepoju said. She added that the workshop, which holds from 4th to 5th December, 2020, was in furtherance of the public education policy of the commission, saying all COVID-19 safety protocols will be strictly adhered to, while certificate of participation will be given to participants. She said the workshop also became imperative in view of the fact that water plays an important role in fighting the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, which is a global health issue.
