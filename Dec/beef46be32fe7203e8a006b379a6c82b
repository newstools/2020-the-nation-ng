The Lagos State Government has concluded plans to train retired public school teachers on how to effectively utilise their terminal benefits, Head of Service, Hakeem Muri Okunola has said. He spoke through his representative Mrs. Bukola Durodola during the ‘Last day in office for public servants in Lagos Education District II in Maryland, Lagos. According to Okunola many retired public servants don’t invest their pension profitably, hence, the training has become imperative. “The training is about mindset change for retirees who still want to venture into other businesses. We discovered that many retirees, in a bid to make more money after retirement, invest wrongly and lose their terminal benefits. Thus, the Lagos State Government is going to train them on how to invest wisely and make profit,” he said. He lauded the Education District II for producing the best teacher in the country last year, and for producing the best public school this year. He said: “As teachers, you have done very well. I appreciate your contributions to the development of education in Lagos State. You have made us proud by winning the best teacher last year and also the best public school this year.” The Tutor General/ Permanent Secretary of the District, Mrs. Anike Adekanye praised Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu for prioritising education. She equally praised the retirees for serving the District diligently. She urged them to maintain their health and manage their pension very well. The retired teachers were given gifts and certificate of service.
