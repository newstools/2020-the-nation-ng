PLATEAU United and Kano Pillars have crashed out at the first hurdle of the CAF Champions League and CAF Confederation Cup, respectively. Plateau United exited the Champions League in Tanzania after they could only manage a goalless draw with home team Simba SC after they lost the home game in Jos 1-0 last week. In Kaduna, Kano Pillars crashed out of the Confederation Cup after they played out a scoreless draw with Senegalâ€™s ASC Jaraaf, who won the first game 3-1 last week. Jaraaf created the better chances in this encounter, but failed to put them away. Rivers United and Enyimba are now the remaining Nigerian clubs on the continent. Rivers will tomorrow welcome Futoro from Equatorial Guinea in Port Harcourt after they lost 2-1 in a Confederation Cup preliminary round first leg tie. Enyimba will be expected to advance to the first round with a home win over Rahimo of Burkina Faso after they won the first game 1-0 on the road.
