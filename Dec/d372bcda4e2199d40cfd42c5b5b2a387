ROBERT Lewandowski underlined his status as FIFA player of the year with both goals, the second coming just before the final whistle, as European champions Bayern Munich went top of the Bundesliga on Saturday with a 2-1 win at Bayer Leverkusen, who they usurped to first place. Having beaten Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi to the award on Thursday, Lewandowski claimed the winner after 93 minutes at the BayArena.
