 CONCERNED Abia Professionals (CAP) has called on Governor Okezie Ikpeazu to sack his Chief of Staff, Anthony Agbazuere, for lavishly throwing money at a guest inside the Government House. A statement by the Head of Media and Publicity, Christian Nwogu, urged the governor to hand over Agbazuere to the anti-graft agency for prosecution. The statement reads: “While we hail the government for Agbazuere’s suspension, we believe the only way the government can boost its public trust is to disengage Agbazuere and hand him over for proper investigation. “Such act, as exhibited by the Chief of Staff, does not suit times like this when Nigerians are trying so hard to overcome the ruins made of businesses by COVID-19. “Agbazuere’s attitude is incompatible with his office and so let the law take its course fully so that public confidence is not lost…”
