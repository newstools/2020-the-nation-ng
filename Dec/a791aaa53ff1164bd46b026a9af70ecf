He has a coach who has a lot of character who can help him become the unique player that we Africans hope he can become,” The ex-Inter Milan star added: “He has everything he needs to succeed and now it is up to him to search for the respect he deserves. He should never stop working; he needs to work every day 24/7. “All these young players should dream and the dream is the beginning of every success and every project. They may have the chance to participate in the best World Cup ever organized here in Qatar and that dream should become a reality as long as they give themselves the means to do so,” he added.
