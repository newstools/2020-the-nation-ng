People gathered but were afraid to rush him to a hospital. We heard him grunting till about past 12am when he became still. “His parents are late and he lives with his siblings around. He is an Isoko boy. When he was hit, he was thrown to the side of the road and fell face down, with blood oozing from his ears, nose and mouth. The driver of the vehicle ran away. “It was this morning that one keke man (tricycle rider) came and said ‘we have to turn him so that he can be identified’. It was someone who came and seeing the clothes he wore yesterday, recognized him. Because his face was swollen. The sister came too and was crying,” the source narrated.
