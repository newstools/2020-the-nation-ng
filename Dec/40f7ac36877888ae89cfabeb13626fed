 FOR Nollywood actor and producer, Oseni Aremu, challenges in the film industry won’t deter him from achieving success. In a recent chat with The Nation, Aremu said he won’t be deterred as a rising act because his eyes remain fixed on the ball. “There are other challenges like the time it takes for a movie to be released by a marketer. Sometimes it takes around six to seven months and it is when a movie is released that we can realize the money spent on those movies. As an upcoming actor, it also takes time to gain that face, there are several insults and humiliations one experiences, either from one’s peers or even those one looks up to, but just because of the passion, we keep going,” he said. The indigene of Igbo Ora, Oyo State, says his career kicked off after a chance meeting with popular actor, producer, and director-actor, Afeez Abiodun. “So, there was a day I was on my way to Sango, and I saw Mr. Afeez Abiodun, then I explained to him my interest in acting, he told me to see him in his office. I later went to his office, the rest, they say, is history today,” he reflected on his early beginning. On his debut movie titled, ‘Lisa’, the versatile actor says, “Lisa is a crime story, but the story is different because it tells a story of how a prophecy led to the birth of a powerful child but unfortunately, he misused the divine power he had and he was killed eventually. Anyway, I love crime-related stories. With only nine years on the job, Aremu says for every role he gets, he gives it his best because a small role sometimes paves the way for the much-desired fame
