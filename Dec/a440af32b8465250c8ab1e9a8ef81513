Our Reporter Suspected members of Boko Haram have kidnapped a groom and his best man as they were returning from his wedding in Borno State. The two are said to be aid workers. The groom is an employee of the UN World Food Programme, and the best man a colleague from the International Committee of the Red Cross. They were abducted by the Islamic State West Africa Province on Wednesday at a checkpoint near Jakana village, according to a report on Saturday. They had gone to the wedding in neighbouring Adamawa State and were stopped at an illegal checkpoint at about 12.30 pm. The UN, on Wednesday, informed its staff in a memo about the abduction of a “UN national staff embarking on a private trip… by NSAG (non-state armed group)”. ISWAP said on Friday that it seized “two Christians working for the Red Cross organisation”. The group said the incident occurred at a checkpoint between the village of Mainok and Maiduguri.
