 LAGOS State Commissioner for Health Prof. Akin Abayomi said yesterday that Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu is feeling much better and is awaiting a complete clearance of the virus before resuming public activities. Abayomi spoke on Monday through tweets on his official Twitter account @ProfAkinAbayomi, while giving an update on the COVID-19 status of the governor. Sanwo-Olu tested positive for COVID-19 on Dec. 12 after his exposure to an infected patient.  The governor had since then been on isolation and undergoing home-based COVID-19 treatment. “I am happy to inform you that the Governor of Lagos @jidesanwoolu is much better. He is, however, still in isolation and receiving home-based care. “We are waiting for a complete clearance of the virus so that the governor can resume public activities. “We wish to thank Lagos residents and the general public for their prayers and well wishes for our dear Governor and Lagos State #COVID19 Incident Commander,” Abayomi tweeted. Abayomi appealed to residents to always wear their masks, maintain physical distancing and regular washing of hands to reduce their risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection. He advised residents to contact the state’s 08000EKOMED/08000356633 hotlines if they observed any COVID-19 related symptoms.
