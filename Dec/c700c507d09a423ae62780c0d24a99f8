 TWENTY-one senior officers of the Western Naval Command (WNC), who were among those recently promoted by the Navy Board, have been urged to remain disciplined and committed to family responsibilities. Flag Officer Commanding (FOC) of the WNC, Rear Admiral Oladele Daji spoke at the weekend during the shipping of stripes for the officers. Five captains were decorated with the flag rank of Commodore, six Commanders shipped to Captain rank and 10 Lieutenant Commanders to Commanders. Daji, who acknowledged that promotion comes from God, noted that the officers’ diligence and exemplary qualities also played a role in their elevation. He urged them to remain loyal to the navy, dedicated to duty and ensure they leave impressive footprints in their places of deployment. “Going through your list in the promotion signal, it was evident that your hardwork and dedication played a major role in your elevation. So you must redouble your effort to justify the confidence reposed in you by the NN and distinguish yourselves in all subsequent courses and appointments. “Your promotion also comes with financial benefit, so we expect that this should reflect in the upkeep of your respective families. So the spouse of the promoted officers should please note. Let them perform rather than give you excuses.”
