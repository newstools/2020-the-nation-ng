The 2020 Samuel Alaba Odumade Education Initiative NECO examination intervention has put a smile on the faces of some SS3 pupils this year by paying their NECO SSCE fees. Speaking on the initiative in honour of her father, Samuel Alaba Odumade, Ms. Modupe Odumade said it was to immortalise him. â€œThe youths of Nigeria whose lives we touched this year in remembrance of our beloved father will not forget us. They are already asking questions about the life and times of Samuel Alaba Odumade, said Ms. Odumade who is a journalist and teacher.
