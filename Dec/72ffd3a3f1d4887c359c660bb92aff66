 Section 68. (1)(g) of the 1999 Constitution as amended require any member of the Senate or the House of Representatives to vacate his seat before defecting to other party. It states that “being a person whose election to the House was sponsored by a political party, he becomes a member of another political party before the expiration of the period for which that House was elected; provided that his membership of the latter political party is not as a result of a division in the political party of which he was previously a member or of a merger of two or more political parties or factions by one of which he was previously sponsored”. However in recent times, opposition parties in the House of Representatives have witnessed a gale of defection to the All Progressives Congress (APC) due to crisis. Leaders of the opposition have continued to insist that there is no crisis in any of the opposition parties that would warrant defection, stressing that the leadership of the House must allow the provision of the law to prevail. But, they have continued to receive cold shoulder from the House Leadership. The speaker either rule them out of order after listening to their protest or merely tell them “your statement has been noted”. The first set of defectors came from River State. Two lawmakers of the PDP, Chisom Dike and Ephraim Nwuzi (Eleme, Tai Oyigbo and Etche and Omuma Constituencies respectively) as well as David Abel representing Gashaka/Kurmi/Sardauna Constituency of Taraba State defected to the APC siting irreconcilable differences within the party. But, when Ndudi Elumelu (PDP, Delta) and other PDP chieftains in the House told the Speaker that there was no crisis in the PDP in Rivers State, he shove them aside. Elumelu who raised a constitutional order said such defection can only be allowed if there was a crisis in the party. He said “the member whose letter has just be read is from Rivers State and I am aware that there is no crisis in the PDP in Rivers State. As a result of that, we are demanding that the seat be declared vacant”. Deputy Minority Leader, Tobi Okechukwu (PDP, Enugu) said “this country is based on law and due process. It is clear that our colleagues who wrote to defect are simply quoting the charisma of the Speaker. The law says there must be a crack in the party on whose platform the member was elected and in the absence of that, such a member should lose his seat. The Speaker must obey the constitution and ask those defecting to vacate their seat”. Leader of the PDP Caucus in the House, Kingsley Chinda (PDP, Rivers) was not left out of the protest. He said the law was very explicit on defection of members, adding that the Speaker, as leader of the House swore to uphold the constitution and the law. He told Gbajabiamila that as Speaker and Leader of the House, he was simply on trial, adding that his decision on the issue would go a long way to save democracy, insisting however, that there are several decisions of the court on the issue of defection. He reminded the Speaker of an existing judgement of the apex court that a lawmaker who defected to another political party other than the one on whose platform he was elected shall have his seat declared vacant, and that the Speaker has the responsibility of upholding the rule. He told the Speaker that he has yet another opportunity to uphold the rule of law, adding: “If you fail to uphold the law, it is either an act of cowardice or a deliberate refusal to uphold the law”. But, Gbajabiamila stood his ground, saying “when I was Minority Leader, I said exactly the things you are saying now when we lose members to your party and you shout me down. You must look at the combine reading of section 60 of the constitution and our House rules. It is in the rules of the House that people can cross and you sanctioned it. You have said I should do the right thing which I will do” Referring to the provisions of section 68 of the constitution on when a member’s seat can be declared vacant, he said “you are aware of a particular member of your party that has not been present on the floor of this House since we started seating. Should I declare his seat vacant? Then came the defection of Kolawole Lawal (APM, Ogun) to the APC. He said he was leaving because of existing factions in the party in Ogun state. Lawal who represents Egbado South/Ipokia federal constituency was warmly received into the APC family by the House Leader, Alhassan Ado Doguwa who promptly presented him to the Speaker, while the opposition leaders kick, but not without the Speaker trying to suppress their views. Deputy Minority Leader however told the Speaker that having sworn to an oath to uphold the constitution, he was duty bound to obey the provisions of the constitution and declare the seat of the lawmakers vacant. But, the Speaker asked him, do you remember when 48 members dumped the APC and joined the PDP? Do you remember what I said and what you told me? Why did you not raise the constitutional issue then? Trying to draw a distinction between the two defections, Okechukwu replied “Mr Speaker, I remembered. It was apparent that the APC factionalised then”. Herman Hembe, one of the oldest members of the House, announced that he has left the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA), that brought him to the House for the APC. Hembe said he has registered with the APC in his ward in August and has since been participating in the activities of the party. Like others, Elumelu described the defection as illegal. He said “by the grace of God, I am the Minority Leader of this House. I am not aware that there is a crisis in APGA and so, what he has done is illegal and the Speaker should declare his seat vacant. We are going to contest this”. However, Deputy Speaker of the House who presided over plenary said the fact that Elumelu was not aware of any crisis in APGA is not enough to say there was no crisis in the party, adding that the crisis in APGA in Anambra state is the base of the party is enormous and enough reason for anybody to defect. Defection to the APC almost became a weekly affair in the House as the rank of the party caucus continued to increase with two other members announcing their defection in a day. Aliyu Datti Yakwo (PDP, Kano) and Danjuma Usman (APGA, Taraba) joined the APC the same day. Aiyu Datti who defeated Abdulmuminu Jibril of the APC in a rerun election in 2019 said he was leaving the PDP because of existing crisis in the party that has generated division within the party in the state. But, many believe that he was merely holding onto his own side of the bargain. Those who hold this view are of the opinion that he signed a pact with Governor Abdullahi Ganduje to defect to the APC after edging out Jibrin who was believed to have stepped on Ganduje’s toe, leading to his exit from the House. On his part, Danjuma also said APGA was currently saddled with internal crisis that has made it impossible for him to actualise his political aspirations. But, Elumelu would not have that and insisted that the provisions of section 68 of the constitution be applied. Elumelu took special notice of the fact that the Speaker made it a habit to tout them whenever one of the opposition members is defecting. He told the House that from his discussion with the leadership of the PDP in Kano State, it was evident that there was no evidence of any crisis within the party, adding that as a man of integrity who took an oath to defend the law, the Speaker has a responsibility to declare the seat of the two lawmakers vacant. Elumelu said the issue of defection may sound funny at the moment, saying “APC members are laughing now and enjoying themselves as members fragrantly decamp from the parties that brought them to this chamber. What they have done is illegal and we must not allow this to continue”. His deputy, Toby Okechukwu also informed the House that there was an existing Supreme Court judgement which says that the crisis in political parties envisioned by the constitution was the crisis at the national level of the parties. He said: “We might deliberately continue to breach the law by allowing people to defect from the political parties that brought them to this parliament. Such situation must not be allowed to continue.” However, the Speaker said “when a member said there is a crisis in his local government, neither the Speaker nor the Minority Leader has the power to say otherwise. If you do, you will have to prove that. I am aware that there is a case in court right now in Kano”. Then came Tajudeen Adefisoye representing Idanre/Ifedore Federal constituency in Ondo State who left the SDP for the APC and Sam Onuigbo representing Ikwuano/Umuahia federal constituency of Abia State who also left the PDP for the APC. The defection of Onuigbo, one of the oldest and most respected member of the House is perhaps the biggest blow to the PDP in the House. His defection was witnessed by former Abia state governor, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu. When the Speaker asked the House to move a motion to admit Senator Orji into the Chamber, not many thought that Onuigbo was the person defecting. Before reading the notice of defection, the Speaker ensured that he got the attention of the Minority Leader and his deputy. The news of Onuigbo’s defection was greeted with a standing ovation by members of the APC in the House, the first time such was happening in recent times. In a letter read on the floor of the House by the Speaker, the Abia Lawmaker said he decided to join the APC as a result of crisis and lack of internal democracy and outright impunity within the PDP. According to him, he arrived at the decision to resign from the PDP to join the APC, he consulted widely both within and outside Abia state and decided to take the step to embark on the journey of helping the APC reposition the country. Gbajabiamila described Onuigbo as one of the longest serving member of the House and one of the most respected. As the APC members were celebrating the big catch, the opposition were fuming with rage, the action must not be allowed to stand. Solomon Bob (PDP, Rivers) described the action as a charade, saying there was no crisis within the PDP to necessitate the step. He said: “Mr. Speaker, I know that you a leader and you know what to do. What we are doing here is nothing but tramping on the constitution we swore to protect. If somebody write to you claiming he was leaving the party that sponsored him to this house because of crisis, it is your responsibility to investigate that before accepting his letter”. Not wanting to give up without a fight, House Minority Leader, Ndudi Elumelu again lend his voice of protest. While emphasising his membership of the main opposition, Elumelu said he was a proud member of the PDP and wants the House to invoke the provisions of section 68 and declare the seat vacant, pointing out that the claim of a crisis within the PDP was false. He informed the House that the National Organising Secretary of the PDP hails from the same local government with Onuigbo, saying “there can never be crisis in the party there. What we are doing is wrong and so, we should declare the seat vacant”. But, the Speaker asked him “some years ago, the Senate President and the Speaker of the House decamped to the PDP. Did you asked for their seats to be declared vacant? Now, that former Speaker has left the PDP and rejoined the APC. Are you saying I should declare his seat vacant? Elumelu insisted that the House was building on a faulty foundation by allowing members of the opposition to defect at will and therefore there was the need to empower a Committee to investigate such claims of crisis in the opposition parties. On his part, Toby Okechukwu said the spirit and letters of the constitution were sacrosanct and should be respected, saying “Onuigbo has taken a dangerous step as there was no crisis in the PDP either in Abia State or at the national level.”        As at the close of legislative work on Monday, December 21, 2020 when the House held a special session to pass the 2021 budget, two more defections into the APC were yet to the officially announced on the floor of the House, these are the defection of former Speaker Yakubu Dogara from the PDP and that of Blessing Onuh, daughter of former Senate President, Senator David Mark from APGA from the APC. Onuh defected to the APC at an elaborate ceremony in his native home on the weekend of December 19, 2020. The event was attended by the Speaker and other APC leaders. However, the governing party welcome the lawmakers into its fold with open arm. Welcoming the decamping of the lawmakers to the governing party, the leadership of the party described it as the signpost of the democratic and progressive environment the CECPC has created in the APC by accommodating all interests and ensuring peace, unity, fairness, equity, justice, inclusion and entrenching internal democracy. Secretary, Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the party, Sen. John James Akpanudoedehe said “we are confident that the new entrants will contribute their quota to the growth of the APC and the President Muhammadu Buhari administration, the CECPC assures that in line with the resolution of the last virtual Emergency APC National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting, waivers will be granted to those who have joined, or want to join the APC”. But the statement credited to the Chairman of the PDP Board of Trustees, Senator Walid Jibril appealing to aggrieved part members not to defect to the APC tends to justify the reason adduced by those who have decided to leave the party alleging crisis within. Jibril was quoted as saying that defection cannot be the solution to their grievances, while appealing to them and other groups to allow the party’s leadership address their grievances amicably. But the question to be asked is whether the APC has the capacity to manage these defections when it has not successfully managed the crisis in some state chapters of the party. Just on Monday, another round of suspension and counter suspension was carried out by the party in Rivers state. There are insinuations of a pending crisis in the Kano state chapter, while Ekiti state is yet to iron out its internal crisis. Be that as it may, the fact that the ranks of the party in the National Assembly is increasing is a plus. Apart from the House of Representatives, the APC gained one Senator with the defection of Senator Abbo from Adamawa state. However, since the coming of constitutional democracy in 1999, many lawmakers and governors have dumped the party on whose platform they rode to power for other parties while still retaining their seat. Some have argued that some of these politicians deliberately engineer pseudo crisis in their party to pave the way for them to defect to other parties. Interestingly parties that are gaining from this exercise have seen nothing wrong with what is done, while those on the losing side have always protested, while threatening court action. But none of these defections since 1999 has ever been over turned. The reason for defecting has been crisis in the party. With the major parties in the country passing through one form of crisis or the other, there is the need for a constitutional amendment that will discourage defection from one party to the other while still occupying an office elected to on the platform of the party no matter the challenges. There should be a way of keeping elected officials in the party till they conclude their term and be free to leave or lose their seat whether there is a crisis in the party or not. Political observers are of the view that some of these politicians often sponsor crisis in their parties to create an opportunity for them to leave. A stich in time saves nine.
