 BENUE State Governor Samuel Ortom has condemned the attack on the Makurdi home of the All Progressives Congress (APC) state Chairman, Comrade Abba Yaro, by suspected hoodlums. He spoke on Monday during a condolence visit to the chairman’s home where youths destroyed property, including vehicles, in protest over the death of a guard in the APC chairman’s house. The deceased was electrocuted while trying to cut down tree branches, which touched electric wires. The governor advised the youth to seek non-violent ways of resolving issues and to involve law enforcement agencies when the need arises, stressing that violent actions can sometimes have grave consequences. Ortom, who commiserated with the bereaved family, later addressed youths at Kucha Utebe. Yaro thanked the governor for his intervention and visit. He said: “Although we belong to different political parties, Ortom’s action shows he is a good leader.”
