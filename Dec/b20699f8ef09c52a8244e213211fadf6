The Anglican Bishop of Idoani Diocese in Ondo State, Reverend Adegoke Agara, has identified lack of strategy, leadership co-ordination as well as knowing how to fight and when to run as reasons the #ENDSARS failed. Agara noted that the tragedies that followed the #ENDSARS protest would have been avoided if the organisers of the protest had withdrawn having made their five points agenda known to the government. Bishop Agara said the #ENDSARS protesters should have gone back to restrategise as the Federal Government made initial moves by the scrapping of SARS. Speaking at a one-day synod in Idoani, Ose local government, Bishop Agara noted that leadership co-ordination was evidently lacking on the part of the #ENDSARS protesters. Bishop Agara stated that a withdrawal to the negotiation table would have done the magic for them. The Idoani Bishop, however, said it was time for the Nigerian government to be proactive, seeking to solve Nigeria’s problems rather than identifying them and doing nothing. He said the Nigerian youth must learn from all that transpired during and after the protest for a better future for the country. According to him, “The #ENDSARS protest, to the discerning and the visionary was evidently a warning signal as touching the possibility of a revolution in the future if things do not meet the expectations and legitimate yearnings of the populace of our nation. “Gone are the days when the masses are taken for granted. A just course indeed but it was hijacked by the enemies in the name of hoodlums. The strategy is needed in such ventures to avoid tragedies.” On the second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak, Bishop Agara said the church was yet to recover from the first wave. Bishop Agara said COVID-19 made the outgoing year a very challenging one. He urged the Nigerian government to investigate allegations that some persons were benefitting from the escalating number of COVID-19 patients.
