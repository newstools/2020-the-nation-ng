 IMO State Governor Hope Uzodimma has flagged off the reconstruction of rural roads in the 27 local government areas. He promised to apply the 3R mantra of rehabilitation, reconstruction and recovery of his administration to dilapidated infrastructure. Performing the ceremony at the Heroes Square on Concord Avenue, New Owerri, Uzodimma said some of the equipment to be used were recovered from those who stole them, to complement those that were purchased by his administration to ensure maximum effect. He reiterated his administration’s concerted efforts to recover every stolen state property, noting that government will continue to put machinery in place to do so, and deploy such equipment and property in areas that will benefit the people. Commissioner for Special Projects Kingsley Ononuju noted that the flag-off was borne out of the governor’s desire to ensure that rural dwellers have motorable roads that will make life easy and improve their economic well-being.
