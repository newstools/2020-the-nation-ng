 EVERTON will be without James Rodriguez and Allan for Saturday’s Premier League clash against Arsenal. Toffees boss Carlo Ancelotti confirmed the double injury blow during his pre-match press conference on Friday afternoon and he must now devise a plan without his two summer signings. Also, Blues midfielder Fabian Delph is unavailable for the big game at Goodison Park as he’s not recovered from the hamstring injury he sustained in the 1-1 draw against Burnley. However, there is some good news for the Merseyside outfit ahead of the visit from the Gunners and Mikel Arteta. Captain Seamus Coleman is ready to make his return to first-team action after missing the last five games with a thigh problem. “Allan had a problem on his hamstring and we don’t know [exactly] how many games he will be out for,” said Ancelotti told reporters at his pre-match press conference. “But for the games in this period, he is not going to play. “Seamus Coleman is available. “Seamus has a strong desire to play. He is a fantastic captain for us and it is really important he is back. “James is not ready yet. I think it is too soon to put him at risk.
