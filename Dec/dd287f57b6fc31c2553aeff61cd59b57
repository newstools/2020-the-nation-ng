 Affordable pay-TV platform, StarTimes, have yet reiterated their commitment to live coverage of all La Liga matches  amid Barcelona’s struggle  in the elite Spanish league. Since 2008, Barcelona have  finished in the top two of the La Liga – winning eight of the 12 titles contested during that time. But  they seem to have their work cut out  after losing four of their opening ten league fixtures, as well as slumping to an embarrassing 3-0 home defeat against Juventus in the Champions League. They are facing two important matches this week including the tie against Real Sociedad  today at 9 pm and then Valencia on Saturday. These matches as well as other  La Liga matches  will be aired  live on the affordable pay-TV platform, StarTimes, in French commentary. Coach Ronald Koeman said he was confident the club was playing the right system: “We are the team that has created the most opportunities in the league and that’s thanks to the system. “We have players like [Lionel] Messi, Pedri and [Antoine] Griezmann. They need space and freedom. And we look for the best for these players with this system. “We are in a difficult moment at the club, not only on a sporting level. There are many more things. We look for the best in every way. “ I see the squad is keen and wants to improve. They know where we have to go. You cannot change in two days, you have to work to improve,” added the Dutch manager.
