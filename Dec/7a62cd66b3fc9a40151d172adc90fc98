Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, on Tuesday urged Nigerians to continue to support security agencies who are fighting the terrorists. Speaking during a meeting with Online Publishers, he described the Borno killings as “an act of cowardice and savagery by a group of deranged terrorists’’. The minister, according to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), said: “It (killings) does not reflect the progress being made by the military against Boko Haram. “Going after soft targets is an act of weakness and desperation by the terrorists who have suffered huge setbacks in the hands of the military in recent times. “The modus operandi of a losing terror group is to go after soft targets in order to stay relevant and it’s not only Boko Haram that does that. “In 2019, Al-Shabab attacked DusitD2 Complex in Nairobi, Kenya, killing more than 20. “Similarly, the Peshawar school massacre of 16 December 2014 in Pakistan, carried out by six gunmen affiliated with the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, left about 150 people dead, most of them students.” The minister reiterated the government’s position that “Boko Haram is badly degraded’’ and can only carry out cowardly attacks like the one against defenceless farmers.
