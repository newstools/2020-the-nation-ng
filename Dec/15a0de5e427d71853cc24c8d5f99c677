The Plateau State Government has expressed concern over the increasing second wave of COVID-19 ravaging the state. Commissioner of Health Dr. Nimkong Lar made the lamentation in a chat with The Nation yesterday in Jos. “We are now noticing some second wave rise in cases of COVID-19 affection in the state. This week alone, we are almost approaching 200 cases, which is not good for us. The number has risen rapidly. There is no doubt we have entered the second wave of the virus in Plateau State. “But fortunately for us, all our isolation and treatment centres are all opened as we have been using all along, “he said. Lar noted: “Though we have 20 patients on admission as our four centres are very active and functional.” He added that eight youth corps members affected by the virus were treated and discharged last Friday. According to him, “when the Federal Government directed that all state governments should go and reopen and reactivate all respective centres, we in Plateau had no problem with that.” Lar said: “As we are almost approaching the Yuletide period, we are worried about how the public will conduct themselves in order not to compound the problem in the state. “As a government, we are disturbed that people have refused to wear masks at weddings and anniversaries without observing social distance.” He strongly advised the public to obey the COVID-19 protocol, saying the state government has “mandated the security agencies to enforce the order”. “Government will not hesitate to take action against any defaulter as anyone arrested will be prosecuted according to the law of the land. “We urge all religious leaders to ensure that the COVID-19 protocols are enforced in churches and mosques to help stem the spread of the virus in the state. “Plateau is not ready to go into any second lockdown because of the virus, in view of the devastating effects it will have on our economy,” the commissioner stated.
