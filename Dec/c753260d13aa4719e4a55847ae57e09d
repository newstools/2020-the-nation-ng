The Lagos State Aids Control Agency (LSACA) said it was planning to sensitise 20,000 Lagosians in commemoration of the World AIDS Day. The agency said sustenance of successes recorded through continuous massive community HIV Testing Services (HTS), treatment and public awareness and sensitisation of stakeholders across the State in combating HIV/AIDS amidst the Covid-19 pandemic has achieved tremendous results. Its Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Monsurat Adeleke, at a briefing on the Lagos Island, said efforts were on to ensure the achievement of eradicating new HIV infections by 2030. In fulfilling the mandate of the agency, Adeleke said the agency has continued to strive to prevent the spread and mitigate the impact of HIV/AIDS. “Thus, the members of the state HIV consortium continues to work closely to ensure that the state attains the eradication of HIV new infection by year 2030, which is in line with the UNAIDS 90-90-90 initiative that stipulates 90 per cent of people living with the virus should know their status, 90 per cent of HIV positive individuals should be initiated on antiretroviral (ART) drugs and 90 per cent of individuals on antiretroviral (ART) drugs should achieve viral suppression,” she said. She attributed the feat recorded to the development and implementation of the National Operational Plan on HIV self-testing. This, she said, was through the use of the HIV self-testing kits to increase the uptake of HTS particularly among the youth, adding that to a large extent, has helped to reduce the challenges of stigmatisation and discrimination. Adeleke noted that despite the Covid-19 pandemic, between January and October, 2020, HTS has been provided for 345,648 persons and 8,400 new cases have been discovered and immediately initiated on treatment.
