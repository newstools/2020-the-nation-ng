The maiden edition of the SRTV Talent Expo has been launched at the Festival hotels, Amuwo Odofin, Lagos. This will be followed by a three day event which commences on Friday, 4th to 6th December, 2020 at the same venue. According to Ogbevire Ashaiku known with the Stage name Daddy Chris, the initiative is to bring a new direction to the entertainment sector and discover hidden talents among other things. To do this effectively there is a partnership between TSTV and SRTV, a London based digital multicast with special focus on arts, entertainment and lifestyle issues. “Our TV station is based in the UK. We broadcast things that are innovative.  We are particular about the three areas that Nigerian youths have excelled in. These are movies, music and fashion.  So, we are coming home to celebrate those who have made Nigeria proud.” He adds that,’ 80 people have already been selected for the talent hunt. The winner is going home with a car and 500,000 naira cash,” he informed Highlights of the event include celebrating the costume designers who do a lot of work behind the scene.. The most important part of all this is the moonlighting film festival and we have selected some films that we will be showcasing.  So, we will come together and stream African  films , eating African food  not pop corn,  So, after the film we will have the after  party  instead of  going to the cinema.  There will also be a fashion show done in a different setting that is unique and natural. ” Ashaiku explained that it is also an International networking event designed to scout and empower talents in Nigeria, whilst rewarding, celebrating and honouring those who have contributed to the growth of the Nigerian creative industry. “This show is aimed to move talent discovery out of the polite drawing rooms into the clamour of the streets.  Nigerians of all ages will be provided with the right tools to showcase their talents.”
