Leicester City’s manager Brendan Rodgers believes Nigeria International Kelechi Iheanacho’s miss from the penalty spot cost them a victory against a difficult Crystal Palace yesterday evening. The centre-forward was handed his second league start of the campaign against Roy Hodgson’s men but missed an opportunity to give the Foxes the lead. The King Power Stadium outfit were awarded a penalty in the 19th minute of the encounter after James Tomkins brought down Luke Thomas in the box. Iheanacho was given the opportunity to take the penalty but the Nigeria international missed the glorious chance, failing to fire his effort past goalkeeper Vicente Guaita.  Speaking to Amazon Prime after the game which ended 1-1, Rodgers said: “We should have won the game. “We had good control of the first half with the penalty and a few other chances we should have put away, without any real defensive problems. On Iheanacho’s penalty miss, he added: “I said at half time, it was one you have to let go of. He practiced yesterday and hit five out of five, so he was confident, but it is just one of those things.
