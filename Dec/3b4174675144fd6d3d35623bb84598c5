 Two Paralympians – Isau Ogunkunle and Faith Obazuaye- on Tuesday got a boost towards  their preparation for Tokyo 2021 Paralympic Games with supplies of training equipment worth N.75m from Africa’s best table tennis player Quadri Aruna. At a presentation held in Lagos yesterday, the Rio Olympic Games quarterfinalist gave support to Paralympians in their quest to make Nigeria proud at Tokyo 2021 Paralympics Games. Aruna said the gesture was borne out of his resolve to give back to the society especially to the Paralympians that have been making the country proud despite their challenges. Stated Aruna: “On behalf of myself and Aruna Sports Shop, we are always happy to support athletes in Nigeria and this is a way of giving back. Having experienced the same kind of support in my first Olympic Games in London 2012. “I think it is very important to support the Paralympians as well who have been doing the country proud for decades. I hope this support will motivate them and help them to do much better in Tokyo.” For the second Vice President, Nigeria Table Tennis Federation (NTTF), Alderson Bankole, the kind gesture of Aruna should be emulated by top players. National para table tennis coach Sunday Odebode, Aruna must be commended for thinking about the Paralympians. “I hope and believe this will help the players to focus more in training and excel at Tokyo, ”Odebode said. Ogunkunle and Obazuaye are African champions in class four and 10 respectively while Obazuaye is also a silver medalist at 2018 Commonwealth Games in Australia and they will be making their debut at the Paralympics Games in Tokyo, Japan.
