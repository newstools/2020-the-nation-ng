 USA-based Nigerian soccer coach, Ikem Udeh, has vowed to leave no stone unturned in his vision to see Nigerian footballers combine education with sports. Towards this end, the Enugu State-born former Julius Berger of Lagos and Vasco da Gama of Enugu striker has embarked on the building of a modern library complex in Enugu. Udeh disclosed yesterday from his USA base that his pet project in Enugu is almost 90-percent ready and would start functioning by early next year. Basking in the euphoria of the project almost being realized, Udeh said he embarked on the project as a way of giving back to the society and to ensure that Nigeria breeds a new set of soccer stars that would not be academically deficient. He said: “When I was growing up in Enugu, I didn’t have the opportunity of combining playing football with education until I got a scholarship that saw me studying at Alabama A&M University. “I don’t want the kids back home to face the challenges that I faced. This is why I’m building a modern library where kids can go and read. “The library will be more of a community resource centre than just a collection of books, and the plan is “big.”” Udeh, before going into coaching, played for Kansas City Wizards, a professional club side in America. He has in the past three years been coaching boys’ and girls’ youth teams in the Hoover-Vestavia Soccer Club.
