Odi-Olowo/Ojuwoye Local Council Development Area in Lagos has unveiled the logo for 2020/2021 Talent Hunt Show for young people. Council Chairman Rasaq Ajala said the show was conceived to discover hidden talents in youths. According to him, the youth had shown rare talents going by the array of stars that have made their marks in various endeavours. He said: “The narration out there about people from Mushin and Odi-Olowo-Ojuwoye has been most often a negative one but in reality, we have lots of “Mushiners” whose stardom has shone over the years and is still shining – in music, sports and business, among others.  “We believe our youth can compete others within the state, country and the world, if given opportunity and support. “It is with this belief that we came together as a team to look into areas where their talents could be hunted and bring them to the limelight, to expose them for worldwide sponsorship in their chosen fields.” He said six areas would be competed for  – music, dance and stunt, art & craft, catering, essay writing, science/technology and entrepreneurial innovation. The competition, he said, was open to all residents, with proof of residency, such as LASSRA and others. He implored youths to participate as the initiative was aimed at offering talented youths a platform to express themseves.
