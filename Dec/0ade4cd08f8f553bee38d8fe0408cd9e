Three persons who kidnapped three Reverend Sisters at Onipetesi area on the Ore-Lagos expressway have been sentenced to death by hanging. The convicts were said to have collected N1 million to release their victims. Seven persons – Reuben Akinbehinje (aka Chairman), Saheed Oyewo (aka Olaoluwa), Seun Lajuwomi (aka Ebile), Abimbola Akinbehinje, John Uche (aka Uchenna), Seun Akintan (aka Egbegbe) and Lateef Hammed – were initially arraigned for the offence. An eight-count charge of conspiracy, kidnapping, robbery, aiding and abetting kidnapping and accessory after the fact, were preferred against them. The accused persons were said to have kidnapped and held their victims’ hostage for 11 days in the bush until the ransom was paid. A DSS official who testified during the trial, Johnson Siunu, said the kidnappers were tracked and arrested through the phone number they used to negotiate and monitor the ransom delivery. Oyewo died in prison and Akinbehinje’s wife, Abimbola, who was charged of being an accessory after the fact, was fined N50,000. Justice Ademola Adegoroye said the prosecution could not produce any evidence against Seun and Lateef Fayemi and so discharged them. Justice Adegoroye found Reuben, Uche and Seun guilty of all the charges and sentenced them to death by hanging.
