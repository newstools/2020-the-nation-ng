Imo State Police Command said on Tuesday that they are on trail of the kidnappers who abducted the Auxiliary Bishop of Owerri Catholic Archdiocese, Most Rev. Dr. Moses Chikwe on Monday. The priest was kidnapped by unknown gunmen in the evening on December 27th along with the World Bank – Umuguma road, Owerri West Council Area of the state. He was taken away together with his driver while the men who took him away later returned his car to Assumpta Cathedral later that same day. However, until this moment no contact has been established with those who took the Bishop away, and this spreading the rumour that this may not just be a case of kidnapping. However, the police told the Nation that they had swung into action and are making progress on the matter. The police spokesman, Orlando Ikeokwu said “we are on the matter. We cannot disclose to you the efforts we have and weather we have made contact with the abductors as it is not for public consumption. Your interest will be when the man is released.” When asked to comment if there is hope for his early release he said “only God can answer that question.” Bishop Chikwe was consecrated bishop on December 12th, 2019. Before his appointment as Auxiliary Bishop by Pope Francis, he was the director of Education of the Archdiocese, and collaborator of the Parish of St. Thomas More. Aside from being the auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Owerri (Nigeria), Pope Francis assigned him the Titular See of Flumenzer. He was ordained a priest by Archbishop Anthony Obinna in 1996. The PPRO, Orlando Ikeokwu had earlier confirmed the story saying ‘It happened Monday. Though the matter hasn’t been reported officially” But the command got the wind of the story from social media platforms He however disclosed that the commissioner of police has activated the Command’s Quick Intervention Team (QUIT) and the Anti-Kidnapping Unit (AKU), to move into the matter with a view to rescue the Bishop and possibly arrest the abductors.
