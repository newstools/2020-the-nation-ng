 THE United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday issued a positively worded briefing document about the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine ahead of a meeting by experts on whether to grant it emergency approval. The FDA was upbeat on the vaccine, saying there were “no specific safety concerns identified that would preclude the issuance of EUA (emergency use authorisation).” The drug authority said its preliminary analysis confirmed the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine developed by Moderna and the National Institutes of Health, bringing it to the cusp of U.S. authorisation. A panel of outside experts will offer their recommendation tomorrow, with a final FDA decision expected soon thereafter. The positive news comes as vaccination programs have begun in several countries with the shot developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, which the FDA cleared last week. Moderna’s vaccine is the same type as Pfizer’s, made with the same technology and also requiring two shots for full protection. And in scrutinising early results of a 30,000-person study, the FDA found it also worked just about the same. The Moderna vaccine was more than 94% effective overall at preventing COVID-19 illness, and 86% effective in people 65 and older, the FDA said, adding that it had uncovered no major safety issues. Recipients tend to experience temporary flu-like side effects that can include fever, fatigue and aches, especially after the second dose as the vaccine revs up their immune system. Even such a large study can’t detect very rare problems. But the FDA looked carefully for signs of allergic reactions after Britain last week reported some possible reactions among people with a history of severe allergies. The FDA found no serious allergic reactions in the Moderna study. About 1.5% of vaccine recipients and 1.1% who got dummy shots reported possible smaller, “hypersensitivity” reactions.
