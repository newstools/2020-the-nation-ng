A 27-year-old man, identified as Promise David, has beaten his 18-year-old ‘baby mama’, Miss Esther Pascal, to death during a fight over food and welfare money for their baby. The incident happened on Sunday midnight on Ebis Mechanic Road, Yenagoa, the Bayelsa State capital. The deceased Esther is said to have a two-year-old daughter for her lover who works for a popular car wash outlet in the Yenagoa metropolis. Some residents of the neighbourhood said that the quarrels between the lovers had been a recurring occurrence. A resident, who spoke in confidence, said they were woken up at about 11.30 pm on Sunday by the loud cry of the deceased calling for help. The source said: “By the time few of us got to their door, it was locked from inside. But we forced it open and met the deceased on the floor. “We quickly tried to revive her with water thinking she fainted but we discovered that she was dead. We immediately apprehended the man and alerted the police.” While few residents claimed the man used a heavy object to hit the woman on the head, others claimed she was given a deadly punch on the head. Already some members of the representatives of the Gender Response Initiatives established by the wife of Bayelsa Governor, Mrs. Gloria Diri, have visited the scene of the crime. Dise Sheila Ogbise, a lawyer, who is the deputy coordinator of the GRI said that the incident is unfortunate and called for more advocacy to end issues of domestic violence and violence against the girl child. A spokesman for the Bayelsa Police Command, Asinim Butswat, confirmed the incident. He said the suspect had been arrested by the police at the Ekeki Police Division and that investigation was ongoing.
