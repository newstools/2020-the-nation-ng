The management of Plateau United  has placed the entire team on half salary following their poor start to the Nigeria Professional Football League after losing 2-0 to Kwara United of Ilorin at the new Jos Stadium in the opening game of the season. General Manager of the Club, Pius Henwan gave the directive while addressing players and coaches of the team, even as he explained that the team has no excuse whatsoever not to beat Kwara United. Henwan lamented that despite the state government’s huge investment on the team, the players are not reciprocating the gesture, warning anybody who is not ready to work for the collective aspirations of the team, will be shown the way out.  “Plateau United is a big brand in Nigerian football and any one of you who is not ready to defend the colours of the club, should just bore out,” Henwan reportedly said . He continued: “Some of you are injured or sick since we returned from Tanzania but it seems others decided to exclude themselves from training under the guise of being  injured. “ Such indiscipline will not be condoned here and anyone found wanting will be decisively dealt with.” He disclosed that the team must recoup the three points in their next away match and until that is achieved, the players will remain on half salary.
