A coalition of Niger Delta militants, under the aegis of the Reformed Niger Delta Avengers (RNDA), has sent a protest letter to President Muhammadu Buhari over the alleged plan by the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio, to appoint his brother as the Sole Administrator of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). The RNDA said though Akpabio had the power to oversee the NDDC, his recent actions and lobby to approve the reappointment of the current Executive Director of Finance and Administration, Mr Akwa Okon, as the sole administrator to oversee the commission was provocative and could trigger a new round of violence in the creeks of the region. The RNDA, in a statement yesterday by its Coordinator,  ‘General’ Johnmark Ezonebi, said  if the approval was given for the appointment of Akpabio’s brother as the sole administrator, the coalition would be forced to review its earlier position on cease-fire and commence renewed hostilities against oil facilities in the region. The RNDA said: “The appointment of a sole administrator alone without the appointment of an EDP and EDFA in the commission just to enable Akpabio to allegedly siphon, divert and embezzle billions of naira into private pockets from the recovered money by Economic and Financial Crimes Commission is unacceptable and immoral. “If Akpabio is allowed to have his way and announce the name of Mr Efiong Okon the present EDFA as the sole administrator to oversee the NDDC alone excluding the appointment of EDP and EDFA, then the RNDA will be left with no option but to declare a total war in the creeks to cripple the economy. We will also announce operation zero crude oil to flow in the creeks of the Niger Delta.”
