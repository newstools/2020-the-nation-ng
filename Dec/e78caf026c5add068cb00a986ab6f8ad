 The Judicial Panel of Inquiry set up to look into Police Brutality and Other Matters in Ondo State has promised to visit premises of individuals whose properties were destroyed during the #ENDSARS protest. A total of 17 persons including organisations have filed petition seeking compensation for their destroyed properties. Chairman of the panel, Justice Adesola Sidiq, gave the assurance when victims of the #ENDSARS protest began presentation of how they lost valuables. Justice Sidiq said there would be a visit to the site of the destruction to see the damage done for proper recommendations. A former governorship aspirant of the All Progressives Congress, Engr. Ife Oyedele whose house was razed at Okitipupa said he lost property worth N52m to EndSARS protest. Oyedele, who was represented by his counsel, Omololu Bagbe, listed the affected property to include his residential apartment in Okitipupa and his political campaign offices in Okitipupa and Akure. Further hearing of his petition was halted due to an amendment to the petition as his counsel was directed to submit the documents through the secretary of the panel. The Ondo chapter of the People’s Democratic Party said there was destruction of the party’s Secretariat and other property in Akure. Secretary and Legal Adviser of the Ondo PDP, Olusola Olujimi informed the panel that part of the destroyed property was being rebuilt.
