Director General of the National Council of Arts and Culture (NCAC) Otunba Olusegun Runsewe believes suspending the game of Golf during the pandemic was a great disservice to the sport. He asserted that the sport involves little or no physical contact between participants, adding that golf from the beginning of time has been COVID-19 compliant since golfers are known to walk their separate paths on the course without any contact whatsoever and at least maintaining some ten metres social distance from each other. He was speaking at a one-day amateur tournament at the Rayfield Golf Club where over 250 golfers participated, including the Plateau Governor, Rt. Hon. Simon Lalong, who teed off the tournament. “Golf is a noble and distinct game” Runsewe said. “Even in a set of four players, you see each player maintaining far distance from each other. “Even Caddies who are an integral part of the game allow some five metres social distancing when they have to attend to golfers. And if golfers are to greet themselves, they still don’t maintain contact. Even shaking through elbows is unnecessary. “All a golfer will do when he wants to greet is to remove his cap, place it on his chest and put it back on his head. Very COVID-compliant as no contact is expressed,” he concluded.
