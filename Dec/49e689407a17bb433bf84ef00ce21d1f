The late presidential aspirant on the platform of the All Peoples Party (APP) and Agbaoye of Ibadanland, Chief Harry Akande, has been described as a true democrat and one of the key promoters of democratisation in the country. A former Alliance for Democracy (AD) Whip in the House of Representatives and Special Adviser on Strategy and Political Matters to Governor Seyi Makinde, Babatunde Oduyoye, made this known, in a condolence message on the demise of the businessman. According to Oduyoye, who hails from the same Idikan Quarters as the late Akande, the late businessman’s immense contributions to the return of democracy in 1999 and the solidification of opposition politics will continue to remain memorable to students of history. Oduyoye, who at a point served as the national publicity secretary of the pan-Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere, described Akande as a rich man with a difference, pointing out that the late politician did not only rely on his money to make a difference, but always got involved where necessary. He pointed out how the late Harry Akande supported pro-democracy efforts pre-1999 and how he also rallied opposition elements to support Chief Olu Falae as the candidate of the AD/APP alliance. “The death of our big brother, Chief Harry Akande is a big loss to Ibadanland, Oyo State and Nigeria. “We have lost a true democrat and an individual who demonstrated 100 per cent commitment to democracy and democratisation in Nigeria. “Students of history will always reckon with the immense contributions he made to pro-democracy efforts and the galvanisation of opposition politics. “I commiserate with his children, the extended family and the good people of Ibadanland on the loss of one of the truly greats the land has produced. May the Lord grant us the fortitude to bear this loss.”
