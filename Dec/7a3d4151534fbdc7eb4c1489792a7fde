Newly inducted stockbrokers have been advised to uphold best practices and ethics in their dealing with investors, regulators and other stakeholders in the economy. Speaking at the first virtual induction of authorised dealing clerks at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), Mr. Oscar Onyema, said the stockbroker’s robe represents a commitment to uphold highest ethical standard and to always discharge responsibilities with honour and integrity. A total of 50 new stockbrokers were inducted. While commending the new stockbrokers for their resilience and adaptability to the new learning conditions in spite of the challenges occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic, Onyema urged them to always put the interest of the market first. According to him, stockbrokers’ robes represent a commitment to uphold the Chattered Institutes of Stockbrokers (CIS) ethical standards and the NSE’s Rulebook for Dealing Members. He explained that the Automated Trading System (ATS) training is a pre-requisite for participating in an oral examination; a rigorous exercise to ensure only suitable candidates secure the required regulatory approval to practice as authorised dealing clerks of the NSE. He advised the new stockbrokers on skills development, noting that the need to embrace the culture of continuous learning in a fast-paced environment such as the capital market cannot be over-emphasised if one must remain relevant. “As the market deepens with the launch of new products, I encourage everyone to seek for better understanding of various aspects of the Capital Market as well as new developments,” Onyema said. Chairman, Association of Securities Dealing Houses of Nigeria (ASHON), Mr. Onyenwechukwu Ezeagu, reiterated the importance of skills and integrity for the newly inducted ctockbrokers.
