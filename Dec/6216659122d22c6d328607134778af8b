Six corps members taking part in the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) in Abia State have reportedly tested positive for Coronavirus. Information Commissioner John Okiyi-Kalu stated this on Tuesday in a statement while reacting to a social media report on the mandatory testing of Corps members posted to the state by the COVID-19 team before they were allowed entry into the orientation camp in Bende LGA. Okiyi-Kalu said the discovery was made by the state’s surveillance team on COVID-19. According to the commissioner, the state government is supporting the NYSC medical team with the state’s medical, epidemiology, Surveillance and rapid response personnel. Okiyi-Kalu said the six persons have been treated and discharged in line with the COVID-19 guidelines. He reaffirmed the position of the state government on compulsory testing and carrying surveillance (on suspected cases) during and after the camping period.
