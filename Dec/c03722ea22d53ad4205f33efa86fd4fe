Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde on Monday visited his Osun State counterpart, Adegboyega Oyetola. He hailed him for the role he played in resolving the crisis of ownership of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH), Ogbomoso. Makinde said people told him that the two states had failed the founding fathers of the institution over failure to manage the crisis of joint ownership. The Oyo State governor, in company with Justice Commissioner, Chairman State Advisory Committee and other executive council (exco) members, were received at the Osun State Governor’s Office, Abere, Osogbo. He said: “What we both do is to put the interest of our students above politics, partisanship and ego. They said we have failed in the spirit of regional integration, oneness in the region. That we should have been able to jointly manage the situation and I told those saying such that they miss the point. The point is that joint ownership has become really challenging in terms of funding and the stakeholders in the institution. When you go to LAUTECH you have Oyo, Osun forum which comes to meet me and Osun governor and in the middle of that the institution was closed down for years. “I told those people that there are several ways to kill a rat, but what is important is that we want to get result, get our students back to school, and fulfil the original mandate, which is to train graduates who will be useful in our country. “What we have done is to come together to discuss the basic problem that has lingered over several years and tenure and players. When it started, it was PDP and PDP, later it was APC and APC and now PDP and APC solve the problem. So for us we are both winners. I came to thank Governor Oyetola. Without him playing the role of a statesman, we couldn’t have solved the problem.” Oyetola urged the Oyo State Government to honour the agreement by ensuring prompt, complete and faithful implementation of every clause in the Memorandum of Understanding.
