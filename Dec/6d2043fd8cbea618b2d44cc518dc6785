TOTTENHAM Hotspur midfielder Dele Alli is looking to leave the club when the January transfer window opens next month as he attempts to force his way back into the England squad ahead of the delayed European Championship next summer. Dele has fallen completely out of favour under Spurs boss Jose Mourinho this season, failing to even make the bench for a Premier League game since early October, while he was an unused substitute in the Europa League dead rubber against Royal Antwerp on Thursday. Mourinho said after the game he is aware that Dele is unhappy and wouldn’t expect anything different from someone who isn’t getting the chance to play. It has been reported that the 24-year-old doesn’t see a way back into the fold anytime soon and his desire to leave is motivated by concerns over missing out on a major tournament with England. Dele was once a regular at international level but hasn’t been called up by Gareth Southgate since June 2019. The emergence of players such as Jack Grealish and Mason Mount in attacking midfield has only made it more unlikely that he will get a recall unless his club situation changes.
