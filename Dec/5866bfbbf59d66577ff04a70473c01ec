 Having done the hard work in the preceding matches, the three English clubs can go into their final Europa League group matches on Thursday without pressure. Europa League matches air live and exclusive on StarTimes football channels. Matchday 6 kicks-off Thursday at 6:55 pm. Leicester City, Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur are already guaranteed a place in the knock-out stage of the competition, with the Gunners having already secured top spot in Group B. Leicester and Spurs, meanwhile, could follow suit with a win in their final matches. Arsenal are the only club in the competition with five wins out of five and will be keen to maintain that record in Dublin against Dundalk. In Group G, Leicester City are at home against AEK Athens. Though on 10 points with Braga, the Foxes are ahead of the Portuguese team on the head-to-head rule and a victory against AEK will guarantee them first place. Spurs coach Jose Mourinho, who has twice won the competition – with Porto and Manchester United – goes into their final game at home against Antwerp needing his team to beat the Belgian club to overtake them at the top of Group J. “To reward our subscribers, StarTimes is giving each pay-TV subscriber 3 VIP membership on the StarTimes ON streaming app for free.
