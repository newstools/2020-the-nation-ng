 PROF. Kayode Alao of the Faculty of Social Sciences, Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile Ife,  has lamented that student unionism had lost its essence and effectiveness, stressing that youths should engage in   constructive unionism. He spoke in Iwo, Osun State, at the 68th Anniversary of the Federation of Iwoland Students Union (FILSU) which had as theme: “Students’ dynamism and effective political participation in the context of Iwoland development.” “Student  unionism is no longer what it used to be as far back as the early 60s. When we were studying in  those days, we were more respected by government. ‘’Youths were those who made government act and execute projects and policies. Youths of today should task government on beneficial policies and projects,” he said. FILSU President Akinkunmi Iromini thanked the Oluwo of Iwoland, Oba Abdurasheed Akanbi, for the success of the union. He made references to projects executed by the Iromini-led union,  including FILSU Essay Competition, Pathfinder Magazine and the shopping blocks at the union secretariat. “As part of the anniversary, the union is inauguration of a block of two shops named after Ishola Hajji, a deceased member of the union,’’ he said. In  attendance were notable indigenes of Iwoland such as Senator Adeyemi Oriolowo, represented by Hon. Tajudeen Ayofe, Prof. Lai Olurode, and High Chief Kunle Alabi.
