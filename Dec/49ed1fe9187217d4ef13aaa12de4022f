According to him, the suspect – Fred Onwuche – a commercial driver, was arrested for not using seatbelt Oduyoye said the attack isn’t the first of its kind on officials of the agency, adding that it has resulted in the death of some. He said: “The incident resulted in a vicious attack on the officer with a pestle. The LASTMA officer was injured. We must, therefore, send a strong signal to others like Onwuche by ensuring that he is punished to the full extent of the law. “There should be no shifting of ground or out-of-court settlement of this matter because it can throw the agency, colleagues and Kosoko’s family into mourning, if not for divine intervention.”
