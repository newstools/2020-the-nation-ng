The All Progressives Congress, (APC), Enugu State chapter has announced the expulsion of Deacon Okey Ogbodo and four others from the party. Announcing their dismissal during the swearing in of the new State Executive caretaker Committee members of the party, Dr. Ben Nwoye who was returned as the Caretaker Chairman of the party in Enugu State said their expulsion was as a result of their failure to withdraw the lawsuit against the party as directed by the National Executive Committee, NEC. “The state chapter of the APC acting on the directive of the National Legal Adviser of the party set up a disciplinary committee to commence and complete the process of investigating members found wanting. “Deacon Okey Ogbodo and his cohorts which includes; Barr. Chike Omeje, Rufus Nwagu, Rev. Onuorah, Ndubuisi Ani and Chinedu Okosisi in flagrant disregard to the resolution of the NEC failed to withdraw their cases at the appellate Court.”
