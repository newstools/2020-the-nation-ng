   The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has warned that January 2021 will be tough with an increase in new cases of covid-19, as people have been seen during the yuletide and holiday period disregarding the laid down protocols concerning social gathering. It further stated that last week was the worst week ever since the beginning of the response to the pandemic because the country recorded more cases. The agency therefore urged Nigerians to brace up for the consequences of their actions as seen in the filling up of event centres and social facilities. The Director-General of the NCDC, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, disclosed this during the Presidential Task Force on covid-19 briefing on Tuesday in Abuja. He said, “We have just faced the worst week since we started responding to this outbreak. We had more cases in Nigeria last week than in any other previous week since the beginning of the outbreak. “Just looking at pictures, images and videos from across the country is a very disheartening situation because it appears that our messaging and our appeals to Nigerians over the last few months have not been heeded, and we have gone ahead with business as usual. Event centres, social facilities are full; so it is no surprise that cases are rising. “January will be a tough month no doubt about it. So we have to brace ourselves for the consequences of the activities that we have decided to carry out in December.”
