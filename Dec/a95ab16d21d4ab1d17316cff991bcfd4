 Doctors in Imo State have said the government’s insincerity about their welfare led to their indefinite strike. The Nigerian Medial Association (NMA), on November 24, embarked on indefinite strike to press home its demands. NMA Chairman Dr. Chidiebere Okwara, at a news conference yesterday, accused the state of being insensitive to the plights of doctors and health workers. He said all state-owned health facilities would be shut if the government did not meet their demands by December 9. Okwara added that if the strike prolonged, private health facilities would also join. The doctors’ demands include ‘immediate payment of outstanding arrears from March 2020 till date to doctors at the state Teaching Hospital, Orlu, and other health facilities. ‘Regularisation of salaries in the state Specialist Hospital, Ministry of Health, Local Government Areas and payments to correct the shortfalls pending the start of the 2014 Consolidated Medical Salaries structure. ‘Circularisation of the policy statement made by the governor, more specifically, the circularisation of the start of CONMESS 2014, to take effect from January 2021’. Okwara said: “NMA will continue to interface with the government to monitor progress made towards restoring the accreditation of three colleges of medicine, Imo State University, and some faculties in the teaching hospital. This includes closing the infrastructural and manpower gaps. “If the measures are not satisfactorily met, the NMA may begin the proposed strike. Regrettably, none of these had been done despite the expiration of the two weeks extension.”
