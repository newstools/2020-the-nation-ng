 THE Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Jigawa Command, has linked the low rate in auto accidents recorded in the area in the last 11 months to coronavirus’ lockdown order. FRSC state Sector Commander Mr. Godwin Alphonsus made this known in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Dutse. Alphonsus, who noted that COVID-19 contributed in lowering the rate of accidents since the road was empty due to the lockdown order, however, could not immediately give the accident figures of the months under review. NAN reports that one of the measures taken by the Federal Government to control the spread of coronavirus during the pandemic was the enforcement of a sit at home order. The sector commander, however, noted that road accidents had been on the increase among motorcycle operators, noting the reason for its current sensitisation drive. “Motorcyclists are more reckless on the road, there was an accident recorded two days ago, involving two motorcycles carrying four persons each.”
