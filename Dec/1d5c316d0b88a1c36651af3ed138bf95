 THE Acting Ejeh of Ankpa, Alhaji Usman Sani, who was last Friday kidnapped by gunmen, has regained freedom. Sani, a first-class traditional ruler in Kogi State, who is also the director of Local Government in Ankpa Council, was abducted while observing morning prayers. He was released on Sunday. Police spokesman William Aya on Monday confirmed the development in a telephone interview with our correspondent. Aya, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), was, however, unable to confirm when the monarch was released. He said Police Commissioner Ayuba Edeh gave a directive that operatives be drafted to the area to ensure the release of the monarch. Aya denied reports that the families paid ransom to the kidnappers. He said the monarch was released unhurt, adding that he had reunited with his family. “I am not aware of any ransom paid to the kidnappers. They were under pressure after our officers were drafted to the scene of the incident, and other strategic areas that could facilitate their arrest. With this, they had no option but to release him. We are making efforts to arrest the criminals. Kogi can never be a safe haven for criminals,” Aya said. He added that the police are working to secure the release of the former chairman of Olamaboro Local Government, Isaac Emmanuel Ekpa, who was abducted near Ochadamu in Ofu Local Government last Friday. The kidnappers reportedly contacted the family, demanding N25million ransom. But the family offered them N1million.
