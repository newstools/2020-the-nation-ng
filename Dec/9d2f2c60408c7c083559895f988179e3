 Joe Aribo is expecting a difficult evening in today’s Scottish League Cup quarter-final against St Mirren. The Nigeria International said  Rangers must be 100 per cent focused and believes Gers will need to bring their A game to ensure they progress in the competition. “St Mirren is good opposition, no two fixtures are the same and obviously this one is a cup game so you know what cup games are like,” he said at the presser for the match. “It is going to be a difficult night so we just have to bring our A game and be at our best. “We have been taking each game as it comes so we have not been looking ahead of one fixture. “Now we are playing in the cup our focus is on that and you can never go into a game with any complacency. “We know what a game of football can bring so we just have to bring our A game and be 100 per cent focussed and that’s how we need to be every game. The 24-year-old is enjoying being back playing football after a spell out and hopes he can continue to contribute on an attacking front. He continued: “It is always good to be back with the boys, when you are out you miss it a lot so I am happy to be back with them and to be playing football. “I feel like every game is a chance for me but when I am starting I want to bring the best performance that I can and help out with goals and assists, hopefully I will get a chance to do that tomorrow. “To be fair I am not really fussed where I play, I am just happy to do a job for the team because really it depends on the opponent and the style of play. “Sometimes I getting it from deeper to drive the team up would be effective or sometimes getting it higher so it depends on the opponent. I am just happy to help the team out.”
