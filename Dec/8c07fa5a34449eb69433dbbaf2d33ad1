 A member of the House of Representatives representing Oshodi- Isolo Constituency 1, Bashiru Dawodu, has empowered 2,000 constituents with N30million worth of cash and working tools, to help improve their social and economic well-being. Distributing the items yesterday at Ewenla Primary School, Oshodi, Lagos, the lawmaker said the gesture was in fulfilment of his campaign promises to his constituents. Some beneficiaries received N10, 000 each, while the items distributed include refrigerators, sewing machines, noodles, canters, popcorn machines and tricycles. Others are deep coolers, gas cylinders, clippers and steriliser boxes, make-up boxes, head and hand dryers, grinding machines and shoemaking machines among others. Dawodu assured the people that they would continue to enjoy the dividends of democracy during his tenure. “If you are trying to make people work, you need to look at the people who need them. This is part of the promise I made to give back to you all. “In my first six months in office, I was able to make health care available in Oshodi and I am ready to do more. I remain focused and I won’t be distracted in giving back to my constituency. I am grateful for your support and I want you to make use of all you get from here,” he said. The leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Oshodi-Isolo, Pa Joseph Olabintan, congratulated the beneficiaries and thanked the lawmaker for the kind gesture.
