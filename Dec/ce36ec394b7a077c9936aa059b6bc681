 The much anticipated undisputed heavyweight title fight between Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury could take place on foreign soil, according promoter Eddie Hearn. Hearn said only a full capacity in the UK can see the  proposed mega-fight stay  in the champions’ home country. British-born Joshua had earlier in 2017 said he was open to fighting in Lagos, a suggestion that was raised by Fury himself. “(The AJ fight)  might be in Nigeria in Lagos, I have heard they have got a big stadium there,” Fury said in 2017. Early negotiations to pit Joshua against Fury have been “positive” and a fight is penciled in for May 2021 with a rematch in November, and only a “few small issues” are still to be worked out, Hearn said. “[The location] will be the next move,” he told Sky Sports News. “Our plan, after speaking to [Fury’s US-based promoter] Bob Arum, is to get the deal in place then go out to the relevant sites. “Obviously we all would like this fight to take place in the UK but you’ve seen London go into Tier 4 now. “We had a crowd on Saturday [for Joshua’s win over Kubrat Pulev] but that has been taken away for the time being. There are a lot of unknowns in that respect.” Joshua fought in New York and Saudi Arabia in 2019 while Fury’s past four fights have been in Los Angeles and Las Vegas – he also beat Wladimir Klitschko in Germany in 2015.
