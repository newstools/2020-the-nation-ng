The Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr Boss Mustapha, and his wife, Olu, have proceeded on self-isolation in compliance with the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) protocols. The SGF disclosed this in a statement he personally authored on Sunday night, disclosing that self-isolation became necessary for himself and his wife as a result of the fact that some members of his household had tested positive for COVID-19. He, however, revealed that they, himself and his wife, had taken the COVID-19 test immediately after it was discovered that the virus had infected persons in the home, adding that they both tested negative for the disease. Mustapha, who is also the Chairman of the Presidential Task Force PTF on COVID-19, urged all Nigerians to take caution and stay safe, noting that the COVID-19 scourge has become even more potent and dangerous. “I would like to inform the general public that some members of my household tested positive for COVID-19 yesterday evening. “Although they are currently asymptomatic, they have been isolated and are receiving care in one of the government treatment centres. “My wife and I tested negative, but will remain in self-isolation and work from home according to protocols by the health authorities. “I would like to remind all Nigerians that COVID-19 is real. As the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) announced last week, we are recording an increase in cases across several states. “Please stay safe and protect yourself. Adhere to all public health and safety measures so that we do not lose the gains we have made in the fight against COVID-19.  As a family, we covet your prayers. “Please Take Responsibility for yourself and to protect our country”, he said.
