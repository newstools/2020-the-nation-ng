Minister of Women Affairs and Social Development, Pauline Tallen has urged the Nigeria Police and Judiciary to support the fight against gender-based violence in the country. The minister made the call at the launch of Cece Yara Foundation in Abuja, an organisation championing the cause of the girl-child. Tallen said that the call was necessary because  gender-based violence would  not end without their support. She said: “I urge the police and judiciary to support this fight because without the action, cases of gender based violence will suffer. “Partnership is key in issues of gender-based violence that is why I am assuring Cece Yara Foundation of my ministry’s partnership and full support; we are going to work together, this is a top priority for my ministry because the child is the future of tomorrow. “It is the responsibility of all well-meaning Nigerians to support and protect the child because it is our responsibility.” Child Protection Specialist, United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), Godwin Odo, commended Cece Yara Foundation for the initiative, adding that it was most unfortunate that minors and toddlers were becoming victims of this ignoble act. “We have a responsibility as a government, as stakeholders, as parents as relations to ensure that we do all we can to prevent the occurrences of these incidences and where they occur,” he said. Founder of the foundation, Mrs Bola Tinubu, said the organisation was established because of the rate of child sexual abuse in the country. Tinubu said the foundation would ensure that children have access to justice and get the healing that they need. “What we need to do is to reach out and help them to provide the necessary space for them to come and disclose their abuse and for us to hold the perpetrators to account. “If we do not hold the perpetrators to account, we will not stop the abuse; we have to deter them by sending them a real good message that they will go to jail if they continue to molest children.”
