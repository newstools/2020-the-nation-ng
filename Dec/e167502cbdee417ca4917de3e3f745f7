 A 2018 Toyota Corolla (EPE 210 FQ) was on Tuesday recovered by policemen in Cross River State. The car was snatched in Calabar and taken for sale in Akwa Ibom State. Commissioner of Police Abdulkadir Jimoh said the vehicle is owned by Ikechukwu Ibekie of No 6, Bassey Ete-Ita Street, Calabar. He works with North West Company in Calabar. Jimoh, who paraded the three-man gang on Tuesday, said they were caught following an operation spearheaded by the anti-kidnapping/cultism team. According to him, the police tracked the gang to Uyo in Akwa Ibom State where they were arrested after robbing their victim in his house. He said: “We have just arrested a gang that specialises in robbing filling stations and snatching cars. “After robbing their victim in Calabar, the culprits took his 2018 Toyota Corolla, which cost over N8 million, to Uyo without knowing they were being tracked. “They were intercepted about 12 midnight yesterday in synergy with our people in Akwa Ibom State. They all confessed to the crime and will be charged to court after investigation.”
