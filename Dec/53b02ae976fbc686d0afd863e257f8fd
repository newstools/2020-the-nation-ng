Muhammadu Buhari extends heartfelt condolences to the family of Oloruntimehin on the passing of the former president of the Nigerian Academy of Letters (NAL) and Historical Society of Nigeria (HSN), Professor Benjamin Olatunji Oloruntimehin. “The President commiserates with Fellows and members of NAL and HSN on the demise of the very distinguished scholar, who at various times served as a Dean, Faculty of Arts, University of Ife, Ile Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University) and the pioneer Dean, Faculty of Humanities, and Chairman Committee of Deans, Ajayi Crowther University, Oyo State. “As a great historian and widely published author, President Buhari avers that the prolific academic will be fondly remembered for the insights and clarity in his works, helping readers and students alike to understand the importance of history in national development, and how individuals and societies have evolved. “The President notes that this administration’s decision to reintroduce history as an independent subject at the basic education level in the country (Years 1-9) will ensure that the works of scholars like Prof. Oloruntimehin, and those who drank from his fountain of knowledge, are preserved, inspiring future leaders for years to come. “The President prays for the peaceful repose of the soul of the departed and comfort for all who mourn,” the statement said.
