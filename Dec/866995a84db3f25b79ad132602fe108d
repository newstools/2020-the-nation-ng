Minister of Education, Malam Adamu Adamu, has decried continuous fall in the standard of education in the country. Adamu, who spoke in Yola, the Adamawa State capital during official commissioning of completed projects in the college, lamented a situation in which graduates can neither read nor write in a tolerable manner. He said the situation was a cause for concern, adding that students and teachers need to sit up and face their tasks squarely if the situation is to be reversed. “Some graduates of tertiary institutions across the country cannot read or write applications,” said the minister who was represented by the Director of Tertiary Education in the Federal Ministry of Education, Hajia Rakiya Gambo Iliyasu. The minister elaborated that students and even graduates had been found to be unable to write one full sentence without multiple corrections needing to be made. The minister urged all stakeholders in the education sector to sit up to ensure that the decline in the value of education is bridged within the shortest time possible. Six completed projects which included a computer ICT Centre, sports centre, a centre for early childhood education, an undergraduate studies complex, among others, were commissioned during the ceremony at the FCE main campus in Yola. All the six complexes were built by the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund), a fact acknowledged by the Provost of the college, Prof Abdul-Mumin Sa’ad, who earlier in his welcome address said: “Today, the Federal College of Education, courtesy of TETFund, is proud to have achieved major breakthrough in structures.”
