Anambra State government has prepared for the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic, Commissioner for Health Dr. Vincent Okpala told The Nation on Tuesday. Okpala, who spoke in Awka, added that sensitisation is already on, adding that the Willie Obiano administration is not taking chances on it. He said the government would not kill anybody on it. Rather, it would continue to preach the message to the residents. The Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) in Anambra State described the Federal Government’s decision as a welcome development. Its chairman, Dr. Jide Onyekwelu, told The Nation, that the second phase would likely be worse than first, especially in view of the new strain. He said: “It’s important we take precautions and strictly comply with the COVID-19 protocols of wearing facemasks, handwashing, social distancing, among others. Public Relations Officer of the Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, Mrs. Chika Ene, said the institution had since the emergence of the pandemic, been maintaining strict compliance on the COVID-19 protocols. “We’ve never relaxed our compliance on all the protocols and we’re not planning to do so, even with the resurgence of the second wave,” she said. One of the transporters in Awka, who gave his name as Emmanuel, said though they were not convinced that COVID -19 was in the state, it would not stop them from following the protocols as listed by the government
