Cross River State governor, Ben Ayade, of has taken steps  to ensure the renovation of the orientation camp of the NYSC in the state as promised by him last month. Commissioner for Youth and Skills Acquisition, Hon. Omang Idiege, disclosed this after an assessment tour of the orientation camp to ascertain its current state.  He assured the NYSC State Coordinator, Alhaji Mohammed Nakamba, that the renovation work will commence in earnest. He said: “ We were here about three or four weeks ago during the swearing in ceremony of the 2020 Batch B Stream 1A Corps members and we did deliver a message from His Excellency, Senator Prof Ben Ayade, on the urgent need for the rehabilitation and renovation of certain structures at the camp. It has all along been his concern that the camp needs attention so we came to see things ourselves because all these reports were compiled and sent to His Excellency about a few weeks ago and he sent us to confirm if they are still in the same state. And as we have seen, they are still in that same state.”
