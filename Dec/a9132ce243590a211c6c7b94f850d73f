President of Chartered Institute of Professional Printers of Nigeria (CIPPON), Mr. Olugbemi Malomo, has said the nation’s printing industry loses N3 trillion to absence of an enabling environment. The union leader urged the Federal Government to urgently make policies that can protect the local industry from importers. He called for an amendment to the 25 per cent import duty on papers. “One of the things that the government should address is inconsistency in government policies. Now, if I want to print a book as a printer, I have to bring in papers. I pay 25 per cent duty on this paper. “But if I go outside to print books and bring them as education materials, I pay 11 per cent. So, we can’t even compete because of policies. So, everybody goes there, prints books, labels them as education materials and brings them in. So, this policy has to be addressed.” According to him, the industry, which can employ 10 million Nigerians, is fast losing its potential to neighbouring countries that target the population as their market. Addressing reporters at the third annual general meeting (AGM) in Abuja, Malomo said Ghana was establishing a mill with her eyes on Nigeria’s huge market. The other West African country, he said, was taking advantage of Nigeria’s moribund paper mills. He urged the Federal Government to revive Nigeria’s paper mills for job creation.
