A causal worker with Gwer East Local Government Area, Aliade, Benue State, identified as Aondona Yaga, has committed suicide. Eyewitnesses said Yaga set himself ablaze. According to his grandmother who was seen with the body, life became very miserable for the deceased who had not been paid his allowance about three years. He took ill and couldn’t afford treatment until he committed suicide. Information Officer of Gwer council Chris Avi confirmed Yaga’s death and his staff status. As at last night, the body was still abandoned at his burnt thatch house in Aliade with his grandmother watching helplessly.
