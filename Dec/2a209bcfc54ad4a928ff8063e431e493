Real Madrid have reportedly identified Mauricio Pochettino and Raul as two potential candidates to replace Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane, according to reports in Spain. Defeat to Shakhtar Donetsk on Tuesday night was Real’s fifth in just 16 matches this campaign, which has thrown Zidane’s future in doubt. The Frenchman has made it clear to the board that he will not resign and Real Madrid hope that he can turn it around, but the club do have plans in place if they feel that the time is right for Zidane to move on. “Pochettino is perhaps seen as the ideal candidate, and the Argentine came very close to replacing Rafael Benitez when he was at Tottenham – had it not been for chairman Daniel Levy refusing to sign his release clause,” MARCA reports. “The other option is club legend Raul Gonzalez, but it appears Los Blancos do not want him to take over so soon into his coaching career and in the current state they are in. Raul knows the club better than anyone and the Real Madrid hierarchy believe that he will not doubt be a future coach.” Zidane has guided Los Blancos to three Champions League triumphs and two La Liga titles during two spells with the Spanish giants since 2016.
