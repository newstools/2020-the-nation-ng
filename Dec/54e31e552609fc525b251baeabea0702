 Vice Chancellor, Federal University of Agriculture Abeokuta (FUNAAB), Prof. Kolawole Salako, has said the institution will soon create a unit for developing agricultural applications on the internet. He disclosed this while addressing participants of the In-Person Capacity Building Training of the African Cassava Agronomy Initiative (ACAI), under the auspices of the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), during the training titled “Data Analysis Using R-Statistics”. Salako, a fellow of the Soil Science Society of Nigeria (FSSSN) and the pioneer Southwest coordinator of ACAI, called for the review of extension activities because they were becoming boring, stating that extension services should be directed at development and encouraged participants to visit FUNAAB as part of the training programme. According to the Vice-Chancellor, the training was designed for national agricultural research partners of ACAI and IITA, adding that the development of agricultural applications on the Internet would assist farmers in their day-to-day activities. The event was graced by the Southwest Coordinator of ACAI, Dr. Mutiu Busari and officials from FUNAAB and IITA.
