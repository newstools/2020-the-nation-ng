Seven persons in custody of the Cross River State Police Command on Sunday escaped from the Command Headquarters in Diamond Hill, Calabar. Commissioner of Police Abdulkadir Jimoh, who confirmed this on Monday, insisted it was seven persons who escaped and not 17 as claimed in some quarters. According to him, one person has been rearrested; three killed while trying to dive into the Calabar River. The remaining three, though still at large, are being trailed, Jimoh said. The police boss added that beside official inquiries into the incident, some policemen suspected to have aided the escape have been taken into custody for investigations. Most of the escapees were suspected robbers and kidnappers awaiting charges.
