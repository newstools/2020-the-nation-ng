The Deputy President of the Senate, Ovie Omo-Agege, has expressed shock and sadness over the death of prolific film producer, Chico Maziakpono Ejiro. Senator Omo-Agege, in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Yomi Odunuga, in Abuja, noted that the exceptional movie director and producer was a pillar of productivity in Nollywood whose works in hundreds of films brought the global spotlight to the Nigerian film industry. According to him, while many lament Chico Ejiro’s death in the early hours of Christmas Day, it is necessary to take consolation in his exceptional impact and productivity as a movie director, screenwriter, and producer who excelled in his chosen field. He insisted that beginning from the days when only very few technical resources were available during the 1990s, Chico Ejiro who originally studied Agricultural Science, blazed a trail by shooting scores of movies within very short periods, sometimes as short as three days. “No doubt, the passing of our dear Chico Ejiro has darkened memories of Christmas Day this year but this great Isoko son from Delta State has significantly contributed towards lifting up our nation’s positive image in ways that only a few in his chosen field can compare. “Even though he completed his earthly assignment at the age of 57, movie-making was second nature to this great patriot whose output with blockbuster films including ‘Deadly Affair’, ‘Blood Money’, ‘Silent Night’ and hundreds of others, earned him the alias of ‘Mr. Prolific’. “We must note too, that through the efforts of patriots like Chico Ejiro, Nigeria became globally acknowledged as the third-highest film producing country and a major source of inspiration for other African countries who also embraced the video format of most of our films,” he stated. While commiserating with Chico’s wife, Joy, their four children, the late film director’s brothers, Zeb and Peter as well as the Nollywood family, Senator Omo-Agege prayed for divine fortitude to see them through this dark period, adding that the significance of Chico Ejiro’s achievements and records far outstrip the 57 years he spent on earth.
