 FLYING Eagles’ Head coach, Ladan Bosso  believes that his team can beat the Black Satellite of Ghana in tomorrow’s tight  Group B tie to  pick a ticket to the next round of the WAFU-B U20 Tournament in Benin Republic. A 10-man Flying Eagles were held to a 1-1 draw in Port Novo on Sunday and Bosso faulted his players’ loss of concentration for the last gasp goal scored by the Baby Elephants and he revealed what the team must do before the encounter with perennial rivals, Ghana on Wednesday. “There was a loss of concentration on their own part and we got that goal. After the goal, we conceded a red card, and even after that we were still playing very well,” Bosso said. “It was in the dying moments of the game that my boys lost concentration. We will look at those areas we felt we had problems. These are not issues we discuss in public because it is internal. We will go back and prepare ahead of the next match. “Both of us have a point each from one match and I think against Ghana we should go for a win. If beat Ghana I believe there won’t be room for any compromise in the last game. We believe we can do it if we can learn from these mistakes and work on it, I think we can play better,” he concluded.
