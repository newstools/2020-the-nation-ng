LEKE JAMES scored his 13th goal in Norway as Molde FK thrashed Sarpsborg 08 5-0 on the final day of the season today. He netted from the penalty spot to open scoring after 25 minutes. Last season, the 28-year-old striker scored 17 goals in the league. Molde may have lost their championship to surprise team Bodo/Glimt, but they will still finish runners-up and qualify for the UEFA Europa League next season. They are still in contention for the Europa League for this season as they face Hoffenheim from the German Bundesliga in the Round of 32 in February.
