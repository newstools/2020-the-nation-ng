According to him, the 2021 Mobile Advert Sticker has been enhanced with better internal control mechanisms, including a hologram-finish, specialised bar codes and serial numbers readable with only special devices. He said the anti-counterfeit properties and authentication system of the 2021 Mobile Advert Sticker protects it against fraud and secures it on a database platform.

He said the incidence of fraud will be reduced to the barest minimum and non-compliant vehicles will be easily identified and impounded. He assured stakeholders that the stickers will be ready within 72 hours after payment is confirmed, adding that all branded vehicles must have their stickers displayed on them.
