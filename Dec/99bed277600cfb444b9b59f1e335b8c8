The police in Osun State have uncovered a ritualists’ den in Yemoja Area of Iwo, Osun State. The den is allegedly operated by siblings – Tajudeen Monsuru and Lawal. The Nation gathered that a woman, identified as Mutiat Alani, and a girl went missing and a manhunt was launched. She said: “The missing woman’s phone was tracked to a vulcanizer and he told the police he got the phone from one of the Tajudeen brothers. He led the police to their house and they were arrested. “Irate youths burnt the house on Monday. We are still in fear.” Police spokesperson Yemisi Opalola said the brothers were arrested for being in possession of mutilated bodies. She said: “We arrested two ritual killers –  Tajudeen Monsuru and Tajudeen Lawal. A woman identified as Mutiat Alani was reported missing and when we investigated, her phone was found with Monsuru. “The police went to the house and recovered two mutilated bodies and discovered decomposing bodies. The brothers confessed to have killed many people but only two bodies were recovered from them. They kill for rituals to help those that patronise them.” The Oluwo of Iwo, Abdulrosheed Akanbi, in a statement by his media aide, Alli Ibraheem said: “I am disappointed that the people can still kill for rituals despite frequent anti-ritual campaigns. The perpetrators are bastards. I urge security agencies to also investigate their allies. “The perpetrators should face the law. Iwo is known for morality and respect for human lives. Anyone caught dealing in human parts should be treated as a criminal and bastard. “I’ve begun the process to confiscate the ritual den. I will approach a competent court to give a permit to confiscate the land/house. A security committee will be set up to liaise between the town and security agents to give information on suspicious ritual killings. Doing so will deter others and chase ritualists away from Iwo.”
