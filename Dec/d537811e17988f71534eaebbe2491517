 Victor Osimhen may have to wait for another three weeks to get back to action for Napoli in the Serie A. The Nigerian has been excluded from Coach Gennaro Gattuso’s list for the fifth time after copping any injury on November 13 while playing for Nigeria in the AFCON 2021 Qualifiers against Sierra Leone in Benin City. He has since been undergoing physiotherapy coupled with gym exercise with the hope of returning to action on December 13. But a revelation by Corriere dello Sport confirmed yesterday that Osimhen may not return to action until December 20 when Napoli takes on Lazio in the Serie A. The newspaper claimed:  “In addition to the dislocation, the inflammatory consequences strictly related to the trauma must also be treated. Recovery times cannot be established precisely, it all depends on the responses to the rehabilitation process, but the idea is that they will be necessary another two or maybe even three weeks: the hope is to have him back before Christmas, perhaps for December 20 with Lazio, but only if he no longer feels any discomfort ”. According to Corriere dello Sport, Napoli is not ready to take risk with their most expensive striker and they are willing to wait for his full recovery on December 20.
