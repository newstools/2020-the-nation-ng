 BOKO Haram terrorists, suspected to be responsible for recent attacks in parts of Borno and Adamawa states, have been killed at the ‘S’ Region in the heart of the Sambisa forest. The air interdiction conducted by the Air Task Force of Operation Lafiya Dole was carried out after series of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions showed that the terrorists responsible for recent attacks in Borno and Adamawa states had originated from the location. A statement by the Coordinator, Defence Media Operations, Maj.-Gen. John Enenche, said: “Air interdiction missions being conducted by the Air Task Force of Operation Lafiya Dole have continued to deal decisive blows on terrorists in the Northeast. “The latest of these was achieved on December 28 at the ‘S’ Region in the heart of the Sambisa Forest in Borno State. “The air strike, which was executed employing a force package of Nigerian Air Force (NAF) fighter jets, was carried out after series of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions revealed that the terrorists responsible for recent attacks in the southern part of Borno and northern part of Adamawa states had originated from the location. “Accordingly, the NAF aircraft engaged the target area in successive passes, leading to the destruction of some of their structures and logistic stores, including a suspected anti-aircraft gun station, as the terrorists fired at the NAF aircraft. Several insurgents were also neutralised in the process.”
