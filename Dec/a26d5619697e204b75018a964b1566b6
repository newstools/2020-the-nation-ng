Our Reporter Taraba State Governor, Arc Darius Dickson Ishaku on Saturday expressed deep shock over the sudden demise of Sam Nda- Isaiah, publisher of Leadership Newspaper. Ishaku in a statement by his special adviser on Media and Publicity, Bala Dan Abu, described the late publisher as a highly talented, hard working and focused entrepreneur whose publishing conglomerate is today the pride of the nation. “His newspaper titles have also been a vocal voice in advancing the country’s quest for a durable democratic culture,” he added. The governor said the death of Nda-isaiah at the age of 58 is premature, sad and regrettable but urged his family members, friends and colleagues at Leadership Newspapers to take solace in the fact that he achieved so much within his short span of life.
