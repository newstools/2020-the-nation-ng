An affiliate of the Nigeria Labour Congress, the Non-Academic Staff Union of Educational and Associated Institutions (NASU) on Thursday said that Nigerians have lost faith in the ability of the Federal Government and security agencies to secure lives and properties in the country. The union’s National President, Comrade Makolo Hassan, said that President Muhammadu Buhari carries the moral burden of his administration’s fight against corruption. He noted that the anti- graft fight of the present administration would be used to judge how well Buhari has performed as a President who carried the tag of “incorruptible President.” Hassan stated this during the National Executive Council (NEC) meeting of NASU on Wednesday in Abuja. The NASU President said that the country suffers from so much insecurity ranging from armed robbery, banditry, terrorism, kidnapping, communal clashes, looting among others. He said corruption was contributing to insecurity in the country as her international borders were not adequately monitored, adding that there was growing fear that weapons enter into Nigeria through seaports and other border posts may outnumber those that are coming in through the porous borders.
