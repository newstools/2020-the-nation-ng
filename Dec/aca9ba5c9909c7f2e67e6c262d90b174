  The lawmaker representing Oshodi/Isolo I in the House of Representatives, Bashiru Dawodu, has donated 30 blocks of classrooms to six primary schools in the Oshodi area of the state. Mafoluku Grammer School, Oshodi, got 12 blocks, Temidire Primary School, Shogunle (six blocks); Ewu Primary School, Oshodi; St. Paul’s Anglican Nursery and Primary School, Mafoluku; Wesley Primary School, Oshodi and Methodist Primary School, Oshidi, got three blocks of classrooms each. Larinde Primary School, Mafoluku, also received instructional materials like school bags, uniforms, computers, chairs, and tables including one generator.  Dawodu said the gesture was to allow children learn in a conducive environment. He said: “I will not build a bridge where there is no river. We owe our people a solid educational foundation by providing them with the basic facilities of learning. For any country to move forward, you need to think about education. Education should come first anytime. “During the campaign, I went through several schools and I discovered areas that are deficient with desks and chairs, dilapidated building, among others. In six months, I am fulfilling my promises and am ready to do more,” he said. Dawodu added that the passion for the rapid growth and development of the community would remain paramount to him.
