 Elev8, a global academy that offers specialised technology training programmes, has launched its new academy in Lagos with virtual events focused on digital enablement through training and skills development in Nigeria. The academy is expected to boost Nigeria’s digital and tech economy. Following a launch in Costa Rica last year, elev8 has helped to re-skill hundreds of professionals, setting local talent on the path to new careers and supporting the country’s technological development. The company has set its sights on Africa, where it will be looking to replicate this model to help transform Nigeria’s business landscape. With the digital economy predicted to account for a quarter of global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) over the next few years, many businesses are looking to accelerate digital adoption to drive growth and ensure efficiency, particularly against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic. elev8 is positioned to support organisations in growing their digital footprint through its executive programmes, intensive bootcamps and tailored training programmes. Country Head for elev8 Nigeria, Ashim Egunjobi, said:  “As the biggest economy in Africa, with one of the largest populations of young people in the world, effectively skilling talent will be the major differentiator to staying competitive in the digital world. elev8 aims to help assess the digital skills maturity of private and public sector organisations and tailor skilling roadmaps to close the gap.” The launch  was themed: “The knowledge-based economy – A pathway to Nigeria’s digitally enabled future”. The event, attended by  leading professionals such as Dr. Omobola Johnson, Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, Olatubosun Alake, and Ola Williams discussed opportunities for digital transformation in Nigeria and how it affects businesses and the economy in the next three years.
