 NIMBLE Solicitors in Lagos is seeking the help of the Commissioner of Police (CP) in Lagos State, Hakeem Odumosu, to quell alleged intimidation, harassment and attempted land grab at Oworonsoki Residential Scheme by a chief in the community. The piece of land at Block 6 Plot 19, the firm said, belongs to its client, DBSPS Ltd. In a petition by its principal partner, Tijani Opeyemi, the firm alleged that the chief forcibly took possession of its client’s property at Oworonsoki, and deployed thugs and miscreants to harass the lawful owners. The land, the firm said, was bought from someone who purchased it from the Lagos State Government. “The said piece of land is part of a Lagos State Government Scheme and never belonged to any individual or family but the state government…,” Opeyemi said. He said on December 17, his client was alerted that the said chief had begun to erect a fence on the land and placed thugs on it to fend off any person who interfered or attempted to stop the workers. The matter, he said, was lodged at the Oworonsoki Divisional Police Station after attempts to enter the property were denied. Opeyemi said: “Impressively, the Divisional Police Officer interceded in the matter and directed all parties to submit their documents and claims to the property latest by December 24. While we promptly complied by submitting ours, the said chief refused to show up at the station and to date neither tendered any document nor gave any legal reason why he should enter our client’s property to take possession.”
