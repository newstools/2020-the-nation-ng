Endurance Bako (22), a 300-level student of the University of Jos (UNIJOS) and Happy Bako, an SS1 pupil, have been kidnapped in Wulko, Nasarawa Eggon Local Government Area of Nasarawa state. The victims are siblings to Francis Ewuga, a 2019 Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) House of Assembly aspirant. Their mother was shot twice on her leg and is receiving treatment at the National Hospital, Abuja. Their abductors have demanded for N20 million to release them. Alex Bako, who narrated the incident, said the kidnappers gained access to the family house in Wulko, near Endehu resort, about 11pm on Sunday night through the fence. He said: “They entered our house around 11pm on Sunday night through the fence. My mother noticed some strange movements and came out when the kidnappers flashed a light in her face and shot her twice in the leg. “Since they took my sisters away, they have called regularly with different numbers to demand N30 million. But now they are saying N20 million.” Overseer of Agidi Development Area in Nasarawa Eggon council Emma Yaro said he has reported to the police.
