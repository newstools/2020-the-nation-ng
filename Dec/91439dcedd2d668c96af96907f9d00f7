The leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Edo State chapters, are at loggerheads over non-compliance by the Godwin Obaseki’s administration of a court judgment reinstating the suspended Chairman of Etsako East Local Government Council of Edo, Aremiyau Momoh, by a state’s High Court in Benin. Edo APC, in a letter to the state’s Commissioner of Police, Babatunde Kokumo, a newly-promoted Assistant Inspector-General of Police (AIG), to the main opposition party (APC), through its Chairman, Col. David  Imuse (rtd.) and the Secretary, Mr. Lawrence Okah, accused Obaseki of obstructing the implementation of the court judgment, which was described as declarative. The main opposition party said: “Take notice that the said judgment is a declarative one, which no higher court has held otherwise, for now. ”While counting on your proactive response in enforcing this judgment, please accept the assurance of our warm regards. Attached herewith is the certified true copy of the judgment.” Edo High Court’s Justice Daniel Okungbowa, in the judgment, described as illegal, null and void, the suspension of the local government chairman. The Publicity Secretary of the PDP in Edo, Chris Nehikhare, in his reaction, however, stated that the state government had already appealed the judgment of the high court and PDP also filed for stay of execution of the judgment.
