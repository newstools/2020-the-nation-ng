 THE Comptroller-General of Customs’ (CGC’s) Strike Force Team said it intercepted goods worth over N1.4billion. The items, according to the unit, included 564 bales of textiles materials falsely declared as machinery, foreign parboiled rice, foot wears and foreign bags worth N895million. According to its Zone ‘A’  coordinator, Deputy Compt. Ahmadu Bello Shuaibu, the unit generated a whopping N1.42billion in the last four weeks from Debit-Note and anti-smuggling The coordinator said other items seized are 1,252 bags of smuggled foreign rice, 564 bales of falsely declared Ankara materials, 637 bales of foot-wears and 30,256 pieces of foreign bags. Shuaibu, who, however, warned smugglers and importers of contrabands that the unit wouldn’t allow them to turn the country into a dumping ground appealed to importers to make honest declarations always. He said: “Importers and smugglers shouldn’t make Nigeria a dumping ground because these fabrics and footwears can be produced in Nigeria. We have textile industries employing huge numbers of Nigeria if we keep on importing contrabands then how do we want them to remain in business?” He continued: “These are what can be produced in Nigeria. We have Hide and Skin factories all around the country. In Aba, we have young boys doing very well producing footwears, bags that the Nigerian Army patronised them for their materials so why do we need to import or smuggle what we can produce locally.” “The message we are passing out is for people to have change of heart for the betterment of this country, our industries are moribund, youths unemployed and government need money to carry out infrastructure upgrading and we need to contribute our quota to ensure that restiveness of our youth is reduced.”
