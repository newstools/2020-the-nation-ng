 A NEW art outlet, Win Arc Gallery, opens its new space on this Saturday at  Ipaja. Formerly located in Ikeja, Win Arc Gallery has been serving the art community across Nigeria and beyond since it opened for business over 20 years ago. The new gallery outlet, which has been quietly put in place in the past few years is already creating art appreciation awareness in its new location. Apart from its focus on creating new art collectors and sustaining the existing clienteles, Win Arc is also using its gallery to inspire young artists within and outside the Ipaja axis so that art appreciation and skills can spread on the mainland. “Win Arc Gallery is an all encompassing art outlet with art works from across generations. Painting, sculpture and mixed media from all artists are available for collection,” the director/founder of the gallery and artist, Archie Abia stated. “The gallery is also available for art exhibitions, particularly for young artists whose works need exposure to a wide audience.”
