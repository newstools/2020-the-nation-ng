 THE Delta State Government has approved the release of funds for the payment of the 2019/2020 Students’ Special Assistance Scheme for indigenous students of the state in tertiary institutions across the country. The Information Commissioner, Charles Aniagwu, made this known in a statement in Asaba, the state capital. He said payment to students will commence before the end of the week. He said the continuous payment of the bursary to state students despite the hardship in the country was a further demonstration of Governor Ifeanyi Okowa’s commitment to human capital development of the state. Aniagwu urged the students to take advantage of the bursary payment to improve in their studies and continue to be good ambassadors of the state in wherever they are studying.
