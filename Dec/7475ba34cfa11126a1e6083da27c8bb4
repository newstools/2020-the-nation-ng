To celebrate Lionel Messi’s record-breaking 644th goal for Barcelona, Budweiser have sent a personalised bottle to every one of the 160 goalkeepers he’s scored against. Messi recently broke Pele’s long-time record of goals for one club on Tuesday by  scoring his  644th goal for Barcelona surpassing Pele’s 643 for Santos. The beer brand released a short film which was titled ‘Kings aren’t made overnight’. The promo showed Lionel Messi making notes for every goalkeeper he scored against.  Messi released a statement after surpassing the record. “20 years ago, I began a journey determined to be the best player I can be and it has taken sacrifice and hard work to score every one of the 644 goals with the help of my teammates.”  Hopefully, fans around the world will find inspiration in my story to commit to their craft no matter how hard the journey because everyone can achieve greatness if they believe in themselves. I’m excited to partner with Budweiser to share this journey with everyone,” Messi said in a statement.
