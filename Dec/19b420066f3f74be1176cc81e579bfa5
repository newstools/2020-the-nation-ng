Gunmen on Thursday killed a trader at Nwambara Junction, along Mile 4-Agalegu-Ishieke Road in Ebonyi Local Government Area of Ebonyi State. Police spokesman Loveth Odah said the killing was cultism-related. “Nothing was reported stolen  from the victim. The commissioner of police has ordered an investigation to unravel the cause of the incident. The police have also ordered the arrest and persecution of perpetrators,” Odah said. Security agents on Thursday cordoned off the Abakaliki Building Materials Market. They were said to have surrounded the market in a commando style about 9am. No one was allowed inside and those inside could not leave. They also shut the Afikpo road leading to the market, forcing motorists to take alternate routes. The road is the main entrance into Abakaliki from the Enugu-Abakaliki Expressway, and the closure caused a gridlock. A source said the security agents  were at the market following an alleged discovery of ammunition loaded in a truck and disguised with other goods there. “We are still investigating”, the source said. He added that the goods were Adamawa State-bound. Police Commissioner Philip Maku did not answer his calls and respond to text messages. It was also gathered that Governor David Umahi visited the market about 11pm to see things for himself.
