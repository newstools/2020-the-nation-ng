Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde has said his commitment to issues pertaining to the transport sector is a key motivation for the establishment of the Park Management System (PMS). He said the decision to establish the PMS is paying off, as the hitherto frosty relationship between the government and public drivers has improved. The government introduced the PMS in the wake of the leadership tussle that rocked the proscribed National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW). Makinde spoke while declaring open a two-day training workshop for drivers in the public and private sectors. The workshop with the theme: “Social Responsibility, Team Building and Conflict Management in Oyo State Public Sector”, is organised by the Ministry of Establishment and Training, in collaboration with the Centre for Human Resources Development (CHRD), University of Ibadan (UI). Makinde, represented by his Deputy Chief of Staff (DCOS), Mr Mojeed Mogbanjubola, said he would put the interest of the people at heart while formulating policies in the transport sector. An Ibadan Chief, Oloye Adegboyega Adegoke, has said a major way of solving problems revolving round petroleum sector is for the Federal Government to fully deregulate the sector by removing its hand from regulating the pump price of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) otherwise called petrol. He said the government should privatise the refineries that are moribund. Adegoke, an expert in the oil and gas sector, noted that by doing this, it would create an avenue for competition among the major distributors. He said if the sector is fully deregulated and refineries are privatised, the money that is always earmarked for refineries maintenance without producing anything would be diverted to the provision of other infrastructure. Adegoke spoke yesterday in Ibadan with reporters after he was honoured as the Distinguished Personality of the Year by the Oyo State Council of Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ).
