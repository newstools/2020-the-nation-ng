  European carrier, Lufhansa German Airlines yesterday said it was awaiting clearance from the Federal Government to resume flight operations into Port Harcourt International Airport and described the country as one of its key markets in Africa. Its General Manager Nigeria & Equatorial Guinea Lufthansa Group Airlines, Adenike Macaulay who spoke yesterday, said the carrier was excited to return to the Lagos / Abuja / Frankfurt route eight months after it suspended flights following travel restrictions occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic. She said, besides the pandemic and the accompanying restriction, it also awaited approval from the Federal Government to lift suspension on its operations due to bilateral issues. Macaulay said the carrier has now resumed five weekly departures from Lagos to Frankfurt with three weekly departures from Abuja to connect passengers into its main hub. She said the new schedule of flights allows all passengers from Nigeria to get the full choice of connecting flights to European, American and Asian destinations from the same terminal 1. “Lufthansa always was and will stay dedicated to Nigeria, one of our key markets in Africa. As we have received the final permission to reopen our flight operations, we are happy to be the first airline to reconnect Nigeria directly to the centre of Europe and onwards to all other continents. “We offer a considerable number of flights to the US and Canada, allowing our Nigerian guests to have family members and friends again at reach throughout the world. Health and safety continues to be our top priority and we are committed to maintain a strict adherence to hygiene regulations for all our flights,” she said.
