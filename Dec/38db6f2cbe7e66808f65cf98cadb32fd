The Independent Electoral Commission (INEC) has said it plans to review its regulations and guidelines for political parties to accommodate COVID-19 protocols. Its Deputy Director, Election and Monitoring, Shehu Wahab, said this at the opening of a retreat on COVID-19 protocol for officials yesterday in Kano. The retreat was organised with support from the European Centre for Electoral Support (ECES). Wahab said the retreat was to review INEC guidelines to accommodate COVID-19 protocols and other related matters. According to him, the retreat is being organised by INEC to comprehensively review guidelines and regulations relating to political parties and election observations. The project Coordinator of ECES, Mr. Hamza Fass-Fihri, said the retreat was laudable as it was aimed at operationalising INEC COVID-19 policy, particularly in relation to engagements and monitoring of political parties. “Political parties are the primary stakeholders in political system and their effective operations within the context of existing legal framework is crucial to the credibility of the electoral process and outcomes, and by extension, the stability of the democratic system. “However, the onslaught of COVID-19 pandemic has impacted on every facet of the national life, including how democracy must work. “It means actors within the political system can no longer do things as usual, because of the ravaging impacts of the pandemic, especially on mass-based activities such as elections and political parties’ activities. “The imperatives of exercising political rights are now being challenged or constrained with the reality of a pandemic that has no known cure so far,” he said. Fass-Fihri added: “It is, therefore, a pragmatic step that INEC has formulated COVID-19 policy that will guide all stakeholders in the electoral process, including political parties.”
