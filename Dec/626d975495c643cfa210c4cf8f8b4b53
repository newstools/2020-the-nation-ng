Minister for State for Petroleum Chief Timipre Sylva said on Thursday that with the discoveries of vaccines in Russian, North America, China and various parts of the world, the oil industry is poised for a game-changer. He noted that the members and non-members Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) had on May 20th met to decide the curtailment of oil production volume. The minister said the curtailment has been the saviour of the industry, but “with the discoveries of COVID 19 vaccine in Europe, Russia, North America and China, various parts of the world recently, we are poised for game changers.” This was contained in his remarks in a video of his virtual participation in the 2020 conference of the Nigeria Association of Energy Economists (NAEE) in Abuja. The theme of the conference was “Energy and Petroleum in a post COVID world.” He also expressed hope that there is a clear evidence that the global economy will eventually recover.
