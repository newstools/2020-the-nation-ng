Former Senate President Bukola Saraki has cautioned the National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Prince Uche Secondus, against interfering in the party’s current reconciliation efforts. Saraki warned that he and other members in the reconciliation committee, which he chairs, would not hesitate to resign if Secondus and his colleagues in the National Working Committee (NWC) disallowed the committee from having a free hand to operate. He said: “We are, however, very clear that our most important partner in this assignment is the NWC. Therefore, we seek your support and cooperation to ensure the success of this committee on its Herculean assignment. “As members of this committee, we have decided to do only what is right. We do not have any personal interest and will not allow any interest other than of the party and what represents the truth, equity, objectivity, unity and peace to influence what we will do. “The NWC must also give us a free hand to operate. I want to make it very clear that we will put in our best. That is why we seek the cooperation of the NWC. “However, if we see any sign that the NWC is working to undermine us or that we are not working in sync in the performance of this assignment, with all sense of responsibility, we will not hesitate to tender our resignation…” Saraki spoke on Wednesday in Abuja after Secondus inaugurated the reconciliation committee. Members of the committee include former Katsina State Governor Ibrahim Shema; former Gombe State Governor Ibrahim Dankwabo and former Cross River State Governor Liyel Imoke. Others are: former Senate President Anyim Pius Anyim and a former House of Representatives Majority Leader Mulikat Akande.
