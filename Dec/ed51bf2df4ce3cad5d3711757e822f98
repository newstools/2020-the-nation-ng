 THE family of a murdered boat driver, Bolouzimo Tulagha, of Agudama/Epetiama community in Yenagoa Local Government of Bayelsa State, has dragged the Joint Military Task Force (JTF), code-named Operation Delta Safe (ODS), to a judicial panel, over alleged extra-judicial killing. The family, in a petition submitted before the Retired Justice Emmanuel Ogola-led panel, alleged that an operative of the ODS, identified as Abdul, of Otiotio Unit, shot Tulagha dead over an alleged suspicion of selling guns. According to the family, the deceased, aged 39, was shot dead on January 13, 2017 at Polako community waterside in Yenagoa Local Government during a military operation against suspected militants and gunrunners. While the ODS claimed that the operation that led to the killing of the boat driver was right and necessary, the bereaved family claimed that the boat driver was shot dead by the soldiers after surrendering by raising up his hands; and that he was innocent of the charges levelled against him. The family claimed in the petition that the killing of their son by the ODS operatives was against the officersâ€™ rules of engagement, which the armed forces, including the ODS, are bound by law to comply with. Also filed before the panel was a case of police brutality by Mrs. Ebiemieme Ename against one Sergeant Fustina, over alleged use of police belt to injure one of her eyes during an argument in a market on November 12, 2014. According to the petition, Ebiemieme, who hails from Agudama-Epie in Yenagoa Local Government, accused Fustina of allegedly using the buckled side of her belt to injure her in the eye. The panel adjourned hearing of the petitions till January 7 and 8.
