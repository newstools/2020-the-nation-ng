The Chairman of Itire-Ikate Local Council Development Area (LCDA), Dr. Ahmed Apatira, has employed 100 youths. The gesture, Apatira said, was to reduce social unrest in the council. According to him, the council has had its fair share of crisis due to exuberance displayed by the youths. If engaged, the council boss said, the youth would have little or no time to engage in criminal activities He said those employed include teachers, office workers, sweepers, and drivers among others. Apatira called on youths to channel their energy to something meaningful. “They should not lose hope of making it in life. There are opportunities abound in this country that they can explore. For instance, at the council level, we do organise skill acquisition programmes for people. At the end of the training, the beneficiaries were given equipment and funds to start their own businesses and be self-sustain. We have not closed the window for such an opportunity. Our youths can tap into it,” he said. Apatira said the council would continue to assist the traders with cash to boost their businesses. “We understand the effects of Coronavirus on the economy. Petty traders too are affected, hence the need to come to their aid. We are going to do that before the end of the year,” he said. The council boss said plans are on to cater for the aged during the festive period.
