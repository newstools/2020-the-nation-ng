The Chief Executive officer of Monimichelle Sports Facility Construction Ltd , Ebi Egbe, has congratulated NFF president Amaju Melvin Pinnick on the occasion of his 50th birthday anniversary. Describing Pinnick as an astute and cerebral football administrator, Egbe urged him to continue his good work as he strives to take Nigerian football to greater heights, even as he prayed for longer life and wisdom for the Delta State-born administrator. Egbe further noted that Pinnick has done well both on the local and international scene, urging Nigerian football stakeholders to rally round and support his bid to become a member of the FIFA council. “We must all set aside our differences and look at the bigger picture of a Nigerian, our own son being a member of FIFA Council. It is in the nation’s interest for us to support Amaju to be in the pinnacle of world football administration,” Egbe said. Egbe noted that Pinnick has since becoming NFF president made Nigerian football a big brand. “All he needs is our support. We all can see that Amaju has taken Nigerian football to the private sector; with less distractions our football would be taken to the height where we all want it to be,” Egbe said.
