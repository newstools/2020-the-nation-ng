Speaking on the film, Towolawi said: “The Miracle Centre aka Panya is my proudest project to date and shows that filmmaking is a team effort at its best. A fun satire about the absurdities of corruption and how it corrupts a society, I hope viewers get a sense of appreciation of its message through the humour.” Filmed in Oyo State, Ibadan, the film plot sees an upright educator determined to bring about a change in the system to ensure a corrupt-free school and society is fraught with stiff opposition and challenges from a group of persons. Other thematic preoccupations include a glimpse into agriculture which is carefully juxtaposed with education.
