 Music label and entertainment management company, Jamika Entertainment has partnered with charity organisation Kick Against Child Abuse (KACA) an NGO, to extend their reach by helping the less fortunate who have aspirations to be musical stars achieve their dreams. The recording company also known as Jamika Force, and home to rising stars Koredianx, Church of Men, and Sultan ‘Afroboy’ made the move to further give opportunities to kids and teenagers in their locality. Speaking on the move, Jamika Entertainment’s head of operations, Stanley Ihensekhien said music can be an avenue to comfort the downtrodden, most especially kids and it can also be a great motivator. “We are known mostly as an Afrobeats, Afropop, and Nigerian contemporary music label but with the support, we look to give KACA we hope with music we could help channel the sadness these children must be going through into joy and perhaps we might unearth the next Mozart.” he said. KACA has been under the radar since 2004, providing support and donations to orphanages around Lagos State.
