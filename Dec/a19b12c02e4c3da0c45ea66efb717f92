 Affordable Cars, a leading Automobile dealership in Lagos, is offering customers a special package on sales and services from October till December 31 to commemorate its 25th Anniversary. The company is offering a 25 per cent discount on car maintenance service as well as free detailing, diagnostics, wheel balancing, and alignment. The purchase of new vehicles from their Lekki and Ikeja showrooms will also attract a one year free routine maintenance service. Its Managing Director, Biola Ayeni, said the company has continued to build first-class multi-brand auto dealership. He attributed the achievements so far to the staff members.  “The company’s 25th anniversary offers an opportunity for us to thank and celebrate our esteemed customers and partners for trusting us to deliver exceptional services to them over the last 25 years,” he said. He stressed that the organisation has consistently worked hard at ensuring customers’ satisfaction through the provision of premium quality vehicles at competitive prices. “At Affordable Cars, we don’t just sell but offer our customers pre-sales and after-sales services. Our 24/7 Autocare workshop is equipped with state of the art equipment to ensure vehicles are given the best of maintenance and repairs. Customers are assured of excellent service delivery at Affordable cars as vehicles undergo a Pre-Delivery Inspection (PDI) by Quality Control Unit at the end of every repair/maintenance before delivery,” Ayeni said.
