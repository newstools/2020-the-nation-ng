Ekiti State House of Assembly has condemned the manner in which the appointments of some staff of the Ekiti State University, (EKSU) and College of Health Technology were irregularly terminated recently. The Assembly said such actions by the two institutions were antithetical to the five pillars of Governor Kayode Fayemi-led government and its good governance agenda for the people of the state. Chairman of the House Committee on Public Petition, Adegoke Olajide stated this during an interface between the Committee and the Management of the College of Health Technology, Ijero Ekiti and Ekiti State University, over the recent termination of the appointment of some workers of the two state-owned institutions. The Chairman, while reacting to the letters submitted to it by the sacked workers of the two institutions, frowned at the indiscriminate termination of the appointment being witnessed in the recent past. Olajide said that the Committee and the entire Lawmakers were not happy with the report of illegal termination of the appointment of some valuable workers of the institutions. He charged the management of the two institutions to give the workers a fair hearing and to be transparent in the report of the panel of enquiry being considered. The Committee Chairman enjoined the management of the two state-owned institutions to henceforth develop a good working relationship between them and their workforce. He also urged the two management to be transparent in handling the matters that have to do with the welfare of their staff. “Though some of the workers of the College of Health Technology were alleged of misappropriation of funds, the commitment of the present administration to fair hearing good governance and fair play has never been in doubt,” he said. He assured that justice would be done, particularly to those who have genuine evidence to prove wrongful termination of their appointment.
