Access Bank’s ‘W’ Initiative in partnership with the Nigerian Governors Wives against Gender-Based Violence (NGWA-GBV), has organised a virtual webinar themed, ‘Tackling the menace of gender-based violence in our society’. The event is in response to the rising cases of gender-based violence in Nigeria and across the world. The webinar featured speakers such as  the wife of Ekiti State governor, Erelu Bisi Fayemi;  her Kwara State counterpart, Olufolake Abdulrazaq; founder, Cece Yara Foundation, Mrs. Bola Tinubu,  and  the founder, Women at Risk Foundation (WARIF), Kemi Dasilva-Ibru. Despite the increased awareness and violence prevention programs in low-resource settings, social norms and beliefs still pose a major challenge to ending gender-based violence in the society. In line with the vision of the ‘W’ Initiative to create a society where sexual and gender-based violence is eradicated, the conversation focused on the meaning and types of gender-based violence , contributing factors as well as how to respond, cope and ultimately put an end to the scourge. On the rationale behind the bank’s drive against sexual and gender-based violence, the Group Head, ‘W’ Initiative at Access Bank , Ayona Trimnell said, “Violence against women is not just a Nigerian issue, just like the COVID-19, it has become a global pandemic. Gender-based violence affects the physical and mental health, dignity and overall well-being of the victims , yet it remains masked in a culture of silence. For this reason,  we, at Access Bank, through the ‘W’ Initiative have taken it upon ourselves to address this menace publicly and on a national scale.  We also encourage victims to speak out and  seek help.”
