Zamfara State Governor Bello Matawalle has called on his colleagues from the North to form an alliance to destroy bandit camps and operations in the region. Matawalle said that his administration was working with the military, Miyetti-Allah and repentant bandits to restore peace and stability in the state. He told reporters on Tuesday that his priority was to secure the state from its immediate past position of being “the most dangerous state to visit or reside” due to waves of attacks and killing by bandits. The governor stated that the basic function of government anywhere was to provide security and safety of lives for the governed. He also said he had halted plans to institute legal action against the acting National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Yekini Nabena over an alleged comment where he accused him of allegedly harbouring and sponsoring banditry. The governor said he was miffed by the allegation but has decided to stop the plan to sue the APC spokesperson due to the intervention of the APC National Caretaker Committee and the Governors Forum. “I have decided to hold on to my earlier decision of the legal action against the APC scribe pending the decision and action to be taken by the party to discipline Yekini for the unsubstantiated allegations against me and my government.
