 MR. Olajide Salako, a suspect in the death of a nurse, Bukola Folarin, who died in a hotel room in Lagos, has hailed men of the State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID), Panti, Yaba, Lagos for investigating the incident. Salako, who spoke at a news conference in Agege, Lagos, said he remained grateful to the officers who watched the long CCTV footage “and saw that I left the hotel premises after checking the late Bukola Folarin before her death.” He added: “The incident was earlier reported that she died from marathon sex with me in a hotel, but nothing could be further from the truth. “The truth is that Ms Folarin and I attended a social function in our old neighbourhood (Agege) on Saturday, November 28, and we had drinks shared with other old friends in the neighbourhood at the party. “We left the party at night and Aunty Bukky (as she was fondly called), requested that I dropped her at a nearby hotel, as it was too late to go to her house (which is far from our old neighbourhood). “Truly, I checked her in at a hotel in Abule Egba, but I left for my home that night about 10:20 pm.” Salako said the fact of the case remained that although she died in the hotel, she was alone at the time of the sad incident, noting that her sudden death could best be described as an act of God. “As revealed by the CCTV footage, Folarin, while in an emergency, called one of her relatives and tried her best to get help, but unfortunately she didn’t survive,” he said.
