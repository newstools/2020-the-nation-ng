Armed bandits have killed four people after attacking Daja local market and Mangun village in Mashegu local government Area of Niger state on Monday evening. The bandits also lost one of their members in a reprisal attack by the members of the villages. It was gathered that the bandits invaded the village market riding on motorbikes and brandishing AK 47 rifles. Sources disclosed that the bandits went to the shop of a local produce merchant identified as Baira but met his absence. Apparently angered that Baira was unavailable, the bandits stormed the market square where buying and selling were going and began shooting indiscriminately. Two people were killed in the market by the bullets shot by the bandits while others took to their heels for safety. The Bandits then went to Mangun Village but met stiff opposition as the residents of Mangun who got wind of the attack on Daja mobilised their vigilantes to confront the bandits. But two of the vigilantes were killed in the shootout between the vigilantes and the bandits; it also led to the death of one of the bandits. The Chairman of the Niger State Emergency Agency, Alhaji Ibrahim Inga confirmed the incident. He said that his agency has been confirmed of the attack but do not know the number of casualties yet. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), ASP Wasiu Abiodun did not pick his calls when efforts were made to contact him.
