 BELLA Shmurda, Omah Lay, and Mayeth ‘Mayefe’ Isaac are some of the music acts that have set the pace ahead of 2021. In the fast-improving African music industry, these rising Nigerian artists have continued to set the pace with massive contributions to crown their efforts as the giant of Africa in the very volatile but very durable industry. Joining the league are also Naira Marley’s proteges, Mohbad, and Zinoleesky, Badboytimz, and Tems. Just like Bella Shmurda, Tems, and Omah Lay, Mayefe’s incredible, interesting and impressive profile has been on the rise, since her arrival on the music scene. With their impressive and superlative productions, which various members of this upwardly mobile group, have been exporting outside the borders of Africa, they are increasingly gaining prominence at the center stage of the world music and also variously being nominated in international awards categories, competing favourably with other known stars at many levels of different genres, much to the inspiration of other fledgling artists. Even with the much-troubled and very traumatic year 2020, occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic, which outrageously set back many things across all sectors, the entertainment sector-nay-music industry, many of these wave-making artistes still proved their mettle with a more promising future ahead. With the very impressive and ladder-climbing performances of these artists during the out-going pandemic year, it will not be out of place that these artistes, under a more favourable atmosphere and high-tech productions under able management, will create more waves and distinctive works, all things being equal.
