West Bromwich’s Anfield hero Semi Ajayi said his journey to the top of English football has been ‘crazy’. Ajayi, who scored a late equaliser at Liverpool on Sunday, has impressed the fans with his displays despite the club’s struggles this season. The Nigeria international’s path to the top has been far from straightforward, taking him from Dartford and Arsenal to trials at Ajax. Ajayi started his career as a youth player in 2012 at  Charlton and spent a month on loan at Dartford of the National League, before he signed for Arsenal in 2013 under then boss Arsene Wenger. After leaving Arsenal in 2015 having only featured for the under-23s, despite being named on the first-team bench on a number of occasions, Ajayi has had spells with Cardiff, AFC Wimbledon and Crewe and once trained with Dutch giants Ajax. “My journey has been a bit crazy,” the 27-year-old told BBC Sport. “It just makes it even sweeter now that I’m finally in the biggest league.” Speaking about his time with Ajax, Ajayi said: “You can see why they produce so many players when you enter their facilities and see how they do things. “They were interested. They wanted a young, athletic centre-back to groom for the first team and I fitted their criteria, so they invited me for a trial. “It went really well but I was looking for first-team football and the route that they wanted me to go would have been to initially play for the B team and then maybe work my way up into the first team. “I just thought if I was going to leave home and then move all the way over there it would be for first team only, ” he added.
