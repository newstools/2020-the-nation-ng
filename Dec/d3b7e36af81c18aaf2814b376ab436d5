 Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Adeniyi Adebayo has stressed the need for increased investment in e-commerce, so as to boost trade and investment in the country. Adebayo, who stated this at the e-commerce roundtable session organised by the Commodities and Export Department of the ministry, said with the approval of the African Continental Trade Agreement (AfCTA) by the Federal Government, “there is need for robust and sustainable engagement in all spheres, especially on how to leverage e-commerce to benefit from the agreement and develop the Nigerian economy”. He said the new face of commodity distribution is e-commerce, adding that in spite of the evolving trends of the market globally, Nigeria has not harnessed its inherent opportunities largely due to inadequate investment in the e-commerce value chain. He said government has identified e-commerce as a major priority programme that will play a critical role in the promotion of commodity trade, especially with the current realities of the unprecedented global pandemic. According to him, this was why the government at all levels is committed to driving initiatives of e-commerce strategy development in line with the Federal Government’s post-COVID-19 recovery plan. “Therefore, aggressive financing and investment in the sector is critical in order to advance our quest for sustainable development in Nigeria. There is need for stakeholders to come up with implementable strategies that will harness the economic potentials of e-commerce in the area of commodity trade for both domestic and cross border markets. “It is a fact that e-commerce is evolving and the issues are cross-cutting in nature, therefore, there is the need for healthy collaborations with relevant stakeholders in the e-commerce ecosystem,” the minister said.
