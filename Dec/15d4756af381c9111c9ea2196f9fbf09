LIKE Mr. P, the second half of the defunct music duo and group, PSquare, Omotola Jalade Ekeinde had her fair share of the big issues that trended in 2020. The duo of Peter and Omotola contracted the deadly coronavirus at different times in the year. However, both entertainers were able to beat it and survive the pandemic. Shortly after their survival, both Omotola and Mr. P took front row seats in the EndSARS protest. The entertainers lent their voices to the protest and became some of the most talked-about entertainers in the year for several weeks.
