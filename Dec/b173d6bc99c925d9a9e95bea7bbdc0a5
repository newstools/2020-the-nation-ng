Former Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino is the main contender to take over at Paris St-Germain after Thomas Tuchel was sacked. It is understood PSG’s players have been told that the Argentine, 48, will be joining the club. Talks between PSG and Pochettino started at least two weeks ago. Tuchel, 47, was reportedly sacked hours after he took charge of Wednesday’s 4-0 win against Strasbourg. Tuchel became the Ligue 1 side’s boss in June 2018, winning two league titles, the French Cup and French League Cup.  They also reached the Champions League final for the first time last season, losing 1-0 to Bayern Munich. Former Borussia Dortmund coach Tuchel’s contract was set to expire at the end of this season. He joined the Parisian club in May 2018 on an initial two-year contract after replacing Spaniard Unai Emery, agreeing a one-year extension in May 2019. PSG are currently third in Ligue 1, a point behind leaders Lyon, while they are also through to the last 16 of the Champions League, where they will face Barcelona.
