 THE University of Abuja (UNIABUJA) has said the certificates of 14,307 students, who graduated from its programmes from 1994 to date, are ready for collection. Vice Chancellor Prof. Abdul-Rasheed Na’Allah, speaking at the main campus of the university, said never again would the university record a backlog of graduates’ certificates. Appealing to the affected graduates, who for one reason or the other were unable to collect their certificates over the years, urged them to make the sacrifices of coming from far or near to obtain their certificates. He said: “The University has finished producing and signing the certificates. They are ready for collection. These are the certificates of those who have graduated from this university from 1994 to 2019. “If you have not collected your results, please come to this university, your certificates are ready. Forever and ever this will never happen again in this university that people graduate and certificates are not given. This is a leading university and only the best happens in UNIABUJA.” The VC said the university had developed an effective and trustworthy virtual teaching system for its students to ensure the process of teaching and learning was not disrupted currently and in future. It said more than 5,000 students are receiving lectures from adjunct staff following the strike embarked on by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) since March. He said the COVID-19 pandemic made the university to make use of its in-house skills and resources to develop the virtual classroom system. “We have conducted pilot studies from April/May and I am happy to announce that the UNIABUJA virtual classroom system has piloted courses taught mainly by our adjunct lecturers because we know that our respected academic workers are on strike and are having continued engagements with the Federal Government.”
