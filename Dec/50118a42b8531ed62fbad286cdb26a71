 NO fewer than four houses have been reportedly destroyed in the Nawfia community in Njikoka Local Government Area of Anambra State following crisis allegedly instigated by certain influential members of the community. People of the community have called on the state governor, Willie Obiano, and the Commissioner of Police, Mr. John Abang, to investigate the crisis to ensure appropriate punishments were meted on the perpetrators. A member of the community, Chibuzor Onwujekwe, whose house was invaded, alleged that the destruction was carried out by some youths in the village who were being sponsored. He said, “The invaders planned to kill me, but I was lucky to be away that fateful day. They destroyed my house totally and looted everything in it. “Since then, I have been moving from one hotel to the other. I am not the only one affected; there are other indigenes whose houses were also destroyed.” Counsel to the community, Barr Mike Ikegbunam, in a ‘Save Our Soul Message’, petitioned Governor Willie Obiano; Police Commissioner and others to intervene in the crisis. In the petition made available to our correspondent, Ikegbunam listed Chibuzor Onwujekwe, Ogochukwu Okonkwo, Dinobi Chukwuebuka and Chief Gabriel Okonkwo as some of those whose houses were destroyed in the crisis. He said, “The problem started on October 18, 2020 when armed bandits mobilised and stormed Chief Gabriel Okonkwo’s house with assorted weapons and right in the presence of everyone, they beat him mercilessly with a view to killing him.
