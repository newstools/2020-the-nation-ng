 THE Yoruba living in the North have resolved to support the laudable programmes and policies of the government of northern states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). A communiqué issued at the end of the delegate meeting of Yoruba communities in 19 northern states and the FCT said the Yoruba had resolved that the country must remain a single, united and indivisible entity as enshrined in the constitution. The communiqué was signed by Chief William Alabi, Afeez Adigun, Chief James Bokirunduro and Yinus Alao, who are officials of the Yoruba community in the North. It said: “Members of the Oduduwa nation living in northern Nigeria must be law- abiding, obedient and have respect for constituted authorities and traditional institutions in the North. “Members of Yoruba nation must carry on legitimate and lawful businesses within the ambit of the law, norms, values, customs, culture, tradition and way of life of the other tribes and nationalities residing in northern Nigeria. “The Yoruba community shall prioritise education, health care, security and welfare of each and every member of the community with the aim of taking care of the children, widows, the less-privileged, the vulnerable and the down trodden.”
