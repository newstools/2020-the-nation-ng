 CIVIL servants in the Badagry Local Government Area of Lagos State have been called upon to discharge their duties faithfully and effectively for the betterment of the people of the local government area. The Chairman, Hon. Olusegun Onilude, gave this call during the week at the pens down ceremony organised by the council in honour of three senior officers of the council who statutorily retired from the civil service recently. The three senior officers, Messrs  Sunday Amosu, who retired as the Council Manager; Adebola Disu, retired Human Resources Officer (HRO); and Awotunde Adeyemi ,who retired as an Information Officer of the council. Onilude said the three retired officers were team players who discharged their duties effectively and faithfully to the growth and development of the local government area. Extolling the attributes of  Mr Amosu, the council boss pointed out that Amosu “is a good manager of men and resources “ whose legacies he left behind as a council manager would be difficult to meet by the in-coming council manager of the local government area. He described him as a “seasoned civil servant who traversed the length and breath of Lagos State and contributed immensely to achievements recorded by his administration.”
