 FOR the 2020 Christmas, over eight cartoon channels with exciting content have been lined up for kids of all ages on the StarTimes platform. This was recently made known in a statement by the platform’s PR manager, Lazarus Ibeabuchi. Ibeabuchi went further to say the contents on other stations on the platform would be viewed by subscribers of the pay-tv firm. He also said kids will have access to cartoon channels which include JimJam, Nickelodeon, Toonami, Cbeebies, DreamWorks, ST Kids, Baby TV for toddlers, and Pineapple TV, among others. “If your children are more into adventures and fairy tales, ST KIDS Channel will air Boonie Bears: The Adventurers during weekdays from December 14 at 4 PM and The Guardians of Carcosa Season 6 weekdays from December 3rd at 5 pm,” he said. Ibeabuchi further said kids will also see popular animation characters on Toonami Channel including Justice League, Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman. Also scheduled to air on the channel is Dragon Ball Super. Ibeabuchi also stressed StarTimes’ new project on its mobile TV app. “To enable each family member to stream their favourite content without TV remote fight, StarTimes has launched a one-for-four project giving each pay-TV subscriber 3 VIP membership on the StarTimes ON mobile TV app for free, in addition to TV viewing. All family members can watch their favourite content simultaneously on various devices. This handy application, available on Play Store and Apple Store, provides viewers with over 100 TV channels and 20,000hrs+ programs,” Ibeabuchi said.
