  A spirited effort by Quadri Aruna could not save TTC RhönSprudel Fulda-Maberzell from going down 1-3 at home on Sunday to TTC Neu-Ulm in Wilmington Halle in  week 11 of the Table Tennis Bundesliga (TTBL). German international Filus Ruwen who started the campaign for TTC fell 3-0  against French international Emmanuel Lebesson Aruna  restored the tie back for TTC  with a hard-won  3-2 scores  against Portuguese international Tiago Apolonia . The  Nigerian started well winning the first game at 11-8 but Apolonia recovered to level up in the second game with 7-11 win. He later  raced to the lead with 11-2 win in the third game and once again the Portuguese restored parity in the fourth game with 9-11 win. But in the decider, Aruna fought well from the start with an overall  3-2  win to put the game at 1-1. But Fan Bo Meng who  has been without a win in the season   was the culprit as he was beaten by Russian Vladimir Sidorenko 3-0  while Ruwen  also fell 3-1 to Apolonia in the fourth game as TTC  team  suffered their third consecutive home defeat. The loss now leaves TTC in 10th place on the 12-team TTBL table with four wins and seven loses from 11 league matches. A disappointed Aruna described the defeat ‘as unfortunate’ while hoping that the team would bounce back in the New Year when the league resumes in January 2021.
