 FOR the last six weeks, contestants on the MTN Y’ello Star music reality TV show have thrilled the audience to top-notch entertainment at the weekly performance shows. One of such contestants is Precious Freeborn. She first impressed the judges during her audition with a captivating performance of Adele’s “Rolling In The Deep” and went on to hold the attention of the viewing audience throughout her time on the show. The 33 year-old  auditioned for MTN Y’ello Star following encouragement from her family and friends. She’s passionate about music, food, her children and travelling. Before the show, she earned a living from cooking and singing gigs. Despite making it to the grand finale alongside five other contestants, she was unable to clinch a spot as one of the top five finalists on the debut season of MTN Y’ello Star. From quitting formal education in primary school to becoming an alumnus of the prestigious Berklee College of Music alongside globally acclaimed artistes such Nicki Minaj, Tiwa Savage, Charlie Puth and John Mayer among others, the MTN Y’ello Star project has definitely been a life-changing experience for Freeborn. Speaking on the premier season of MTN Y’ello Star, Richard Iweanoge, General Manager, Brand and Communications, MTN Nigeria said: “the MTN Y’ello Star project is one we are deeply passionate about, it goes beyond the gala shows Nigerians have come to love over the past few weeks.”
