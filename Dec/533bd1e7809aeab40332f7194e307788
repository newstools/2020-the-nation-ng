 Lagos Boxing Hall of Fame (LBHF), the organisers of the Lagos Governor’s Belt, have announced indefinite postponement of the 11nd edition of the event, slated to hold on Boxing Day. The show, billed to hold at the Molade Okoya-Thomas Sports hall, Teslim Balogun stadium will now hold at a date to be announced later. The decision to postpone the event was announced on Wednesday by Tajudeen Alabi, Coordinator of LBHF. He said that the postponement was prompted by a resurgence of the coronavirus pandemic, which has prompted the Federal and Lagos State Government to impose restrictions on events. “We consulted widely with various boxing stakeholders as well as our sponsors before reaching the decision to shift the event to a later date,” Alabi said. “As disappointing as this may be, we are of the view that public safety and wellbeing of the populace are of utmost importance.”
