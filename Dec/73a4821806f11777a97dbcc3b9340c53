 THE All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ogun State has inaugurated a 36-member caretaker executive members that will pilot the affairs of the party in the next six months. Its Chairman Chief Yemi Sanusi, who inaugurated the members at the party’s secretariat in Abeokuta yesterday, called for synergy among party faithful. The inauguration was conducted by Mr Habeeb Ajayi amid jubilation by  loyalists who thronged the venue in their numbers. It held after the APC National Caretaker and Convention Planning Committee led by its Chairman and Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, swore in 37 caretaker chairmen for the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory at the party’s National Secretariat in Abuja last Friday. Sanusi said the doors of the party are open to all in line with the directives of the APC National Secretariat. He stated that it was imperative for members to close ranks towards strengthening the party for future elections. The Chairman pointed out that with the dissolution of the party structure at all levels and subsequent constitution and inauguration of  caretaker chairmen, there is need for synergy among members. “As directed by the National Secretariat, the doors of the party are now open for intending members who may want to join our party from all the 236 wards in Ogun State,” Sanusi stated. The Chairman also used the occasion to enjoin APC members to go out and mobilise for party membership registration as well as voter registration coming up next year. “As we prepare for the voter registration by INEC and revalidation of our membership, I urge us to be aggressive and dogged in our new membership drive, so that it can translate to another electoral victory for our party,” Sanusi added.
