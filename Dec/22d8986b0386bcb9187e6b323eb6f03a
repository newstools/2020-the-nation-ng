Succour came the way of some widows in Ojokoro Local Council Development Area (LCDA) in Lagos as Olateju Adeoye, a chairmanship aspirant, reached out to them with some foodstuff. The relief materials were received by the Ojokoro All Progressives Congress (APC) party Chairman, Prince Adewale Bello and some party chieftains, at the Secretariat, Jankara Ijaiye. Olateju said the relief materials were meant to ameliorate the sufferings of the widows. “I’m aware of the plight of the widows in Ojokoro LCDA and as such, I have been moved to dole out these food items to reduce the hardship especially during this pandemic,” he said. He, however, said the philanthropic gesture has nothing to do with his political ambition. “It is about rendering service to humanity and putting smiles on the faces of the less privileged in our community,” he said. Olateju pledged more assistance to the needy.
