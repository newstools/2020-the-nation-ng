A tanker laden with 44,000 litres of diesel was gutted by fire on Otedola Bridge along Lagos/Ibadan Expressway, causing panic among commuters plying the route. The incident reportedly happened around 6pm, causing massive gridlock on the ever-busy expressway. It was gathered that the tanker was fully loaded with 44,000 liters of AGO (diesel) and was moving toward the Berger axis of the expressway when one of its tyres suddenly burst into flames. At the time of filing this report, the section of the road where the accident occurred was cordoned off to allow emergency response agencies to put out the fire completely.  According to the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency, no injuries were recorded in the incident but the extent of property damaged is still being determined. “The Agency has responded and upon arrival of the Agency’s officials at the incident scene, it was observed that a tanker conveying an unknown amount of diesel fell, spilling its content, which resulted to an explosion that affected a truck conveying goods,” a statement signed by LASEMA Chief, Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu, said. The statement added that rescue and recovery operations were ongoing.
