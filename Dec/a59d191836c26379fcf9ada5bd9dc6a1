 Rector, Yaba College of Technology (YABATECH),  Mr. Obafemi Omokungbe, has reaffirmed the college’s commitment to eliminating sexual harassment with the launch of a policy document to that effect. This was just as the college unveiled the Yaba Art Museum, a project supported by the Ford Foundation. Speaking at the event, held at the Yusuf Grillo Auditorium, Omokungbe noted that the launch of  the ‘YCT Policy on Sexual Harassment and other Forms of Gender-based Violence’, reaffirmed the college’s commitment to end sexual harassment. “The launch of YCT policy on sexual harassment is a reaffirmation of our commitment to eliminate and prevent gender-based violence in our environment. With a zero tolerance for sexual harassment in the college,it is only right that we take necessary steps for its sustenance,” he said. On the art museum which is housed inside the basement of YABATECH School of Art, Design and Printing, Omokungbe said it was the first of its kind. “The art museum will serve both cultural and education purposes, with the intent to teach, train and be a resource space for both researchers and learners,” he said. He said the institution had produced famous artists who he praised for their contributions towards the realisation of the project. He thanked the Ford Foundation for its support and contribution of $100,000 for the project. He canvassed the support of well-meaning individuals, corporate organisations, stakeholders and friends of the college for the forthcoming launch of N50 billion Endowment Fund to assist the college in upgrading and development of its infrastructure to boost  learning and research. Lagos State Commissioner for Tourism, Arts and Culture,  Mrs. .Uzamat Akinbile-Yusuf, lauded the college for scoring another first with the initiative. She urged the institution to collaborate with the state government to put the Museum to good use.
