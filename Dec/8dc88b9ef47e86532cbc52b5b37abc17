The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has said that the death of the National Chairman of Labour Party, Alhaji Abdulkadir Abdulsalam was a major loss to the country’s opposition politics and democracy at large. The governing party in a condolence message by its Secretary Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Senator John James Akpanudoedehe in Abuja on Wednesday eulogized Abdulsalam for his contributions to the country’s democratic development. The statement reads: “The All Progressives Congress (APC) extend condolences to members of Nigeria’s Labour Party over the death of the Party’s National Chairman, Alhaji Abdulkadir Abdulsalam. “We mourn the late Abdulsalam whose passage is a major loss to Nigeria’s opposition politics and our democracy at large. “In line with the Labour Party’s mantra, as National Chairman, the late Abdulsalam will be remembered for his efforts to entrench Labour Party as the Party for Social Democracy and advocate for the welfare of workers, particularly the increment of minimum wage.” The party also commiserated with the immediate family of Abdulsalam and prayed “Almighty Allah forgives his shortcomings and grant him Al Jannah Firdaus.”
