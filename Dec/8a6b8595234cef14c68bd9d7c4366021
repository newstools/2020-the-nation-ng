 After a vote held at the end of the group stage of the UEFA Champions League, UEFA designated Neymar Jr as the player of the European week. This week signalled the end of the group stage of the Champions League – Paris Saint-Germain signed off in style with a big win against Istanbul Basaksehir (5-1) to finish top of Group H. Neymar Jr, who scored a hat-trick against the Turkish club, was able to leave with the match ball after playing a massive role in the attacking demonstration of the Rouge et Bleu.  He finished ahead of Youssef En-Nesyri (FC Sévilla), Karim Benzema (Real Madrid) and Anatoliy Trubin (Shakhtar Donetsk) who all shone during the week. Note that the Brazilian is also in the running for goal of the week for his magical opening goal: the control, nutmeg and curled shot into the top corner (1-0, 20′). Last of all – like Kylian Mbappé – he’s part of the UEFA Champions League team of the week.
