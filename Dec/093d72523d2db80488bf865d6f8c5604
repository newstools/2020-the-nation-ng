 Akwa Ibom State Government has canceled all government events requiring large crowds over the worrisome spike in COVID-19 cases. This is as 48 new cases have been recorded at the second wave of the pandemic. The state, which had earlier recorded a zero positive case status, has therefore vowed to ensure strict enforcement of COVID-19 guidelines and protocols in all parts of the state.
