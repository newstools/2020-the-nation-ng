LIVERPOOL ended a three-month wait for an away win in the Premier League in record fashion with a 7-0 thrashing of Crystal Palace on Saturday to move six points clear at the top of the table. The English champions’ first ever away win in the top-flight by seven goals laid down a marker for the challengers hoping to dethrone Jurgen Klopp’s men. Liverpool built on the momentum of a last-minute winner that beat second-placed Tottenham in midweek as Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah scored twice at Selhurst Park, while Takumi Minamino, Sadio Mane and Jordan Henderson also netted. Victory ensured Liverpool will lead the league at Christmas for a third successive season and, on this evidence, will take some catching in the new year. “We will have a good Christmas,” said Klopp. “The season is not finished unfortunately, there are a few more games to come.” Due to the late start to the campaign, there are still nearly two-thirds of the season to go, but Liverpool have so far survived an injury crisis and should only get stronger with more players returning and the chance to cover for Virgil Van Dijk’s long-term absence by buying a centre-back in January. Klopp has repeatedly bemoaned having to play Saturday lunchtime kick-offs after Wednesday night games, but his side suffered no hangover from their exertions against Spurs. “The boys are capable of that. It will not happen every week but it can happen,” added Klopp. “It just clicked today. After a really intense period for the boys they should be really proud of how they came through that results wise.”
