The Director-General of the National Institute for Pharmaceutical Research and Development (NIPRD), Dr Obi Adigwe, has stated that his agency’s phytomedicines verification and validation protocol will ensure security of medicines across the country. He also said that the document which is developed by the National Scientific Advisory Committee (NSAC) on COVID-19 cure claims, focused on efficient and sustainable utilisation of local resources for self-reliance in pharmaceutical production and services. Adigwe stated this during the public presentation of the phytomedicine verification and validation protocol document in Abuja. Minister of State for Health, Dr Olorunnibe Mamora, praised NIPRD’s management for its thoughtfulness and foresight in convening the National Scientific Advisory Committee which developed this valuable protocol. “Under my watch, I will ensure that the protocol is implemented in the coming year through adequate budgetary allocation and funding, most especially now that there seems to be an emergence of a second wave of the pandemic in many parts of the world. “I also wish to use this medium to call on our health systems development partners to support NIPRD in implementing the protocol.”
