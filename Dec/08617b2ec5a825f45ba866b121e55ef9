The Councillor representing Ward One in Ewohimi, Esan Southeast Local Government Area of Edo State, Israel Inyanabor, was kidnapped on Wednesday. Inyanabor was seized on the Ewatto-Ubiaja-Okhuesan Road, near Ena River. Inyanabor was kidnapped at the same spot where a couple was kidnapped. He was driving when gunmen suddenly came from the forest, opened fire on him, forcing him to stop. He was taken into the bush and his car abandoned. Police spokesman Chidi Nwabuzor was yet to respond to his calls as at last night. The expectant mother, Uju Okwudili, who was on Monday kidnapped on Airport Road, Benin, was released on Wednesday. It could not be confirmed if the N5 million ransom her abductors demanded was paid.
