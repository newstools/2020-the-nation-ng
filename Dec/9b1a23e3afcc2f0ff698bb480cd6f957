 THE monarch of lba kingdom in Lagos State, the Oniba-Ekun, Oba Adeshina Raji Ashade, Ilufemiloye 1, has reiterated his commitment to the socio-economic development and well-being of his people. He spoke at the foundation laying of an ultra-modern maternity at lba, which he sponsored. Oba Ashade said the well-being of the indigenes is paramount in his heart. He said when completed, the maternity would be handed over to the government, adding that it would complement the only public health care centre in the area, to ensure residents enjoyed affordable and quality health care services. The traditional ruler said plans were underway to facilitate the building of a modern market, a secondary school, as well as attracting commercial banks to lba. Oba Ashade advised his subjects and residents to support him in attracting development to the area. He said they should desist from anything that could threaten security. A former commissioner for Agriculture in Lagos State and an All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain in the area, Oluwatoyin Surau, hailed the monarch, saying in less than a month of ascending the throne, he had proved that he cherished the development of lba.
