The  Minister of Youth and Sports Development Sunday Dare has affirmed that the resumption of the Nigeria Professional Football League  has brought  a big relief after months of uncertainty  . Dare declared as  much  in a  media chart following the kick-off of the new NPFL season last weekend. “Truly, it is really a sign of relief to see the NPFL return. You can see the excitement on the social media and economic activities in different venues talking about the hotels, restaurants and hosts of others who are beneficiaries of the restart of the league. “The return of the league brought about economic gains and it will reduce social vices among the youths. “Even the gladiators of the game are not left out of the party, players get travel allowances, referees, match officials and as well back room staff, “Dare posited. The Minister commended the efforts the LMC for ensuring that the NPFL returned, while assuring that the Ministry of Sports will give them full support. “I want to commend the LMC for restarting the league, as a ministry we will support LMC to grow the league, which is critical for sports Development in the country.” “The contents are coming back gradually, which is key to football development. The LMC alone cannot promote the league; the media has a very important role to pay as well. “We must project the league in a good light as sports journalists. You see what European journalists are doing to promote their league and their players; we can emulate good projection and add value to the league. This will attract more sponsors to  invest in our league. “We are deliberate about licensing of players,  content of the league and facilities  to meet the required standard ; once again I want to thank the LMC for strict adherence to these key components that can give the league a new look,” noted  the Sports Minister.
