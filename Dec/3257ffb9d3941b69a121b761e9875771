Organised Labour under the platform of Association of Senior Civil Servants of Nigeria (ASCSN) has condemned plans by the 36 States Governors to siphon ₦17 trillion from workers pension funds. In a press statement issued in Lagos, the  ASCSN  Secretary-General, Comrade  Alade Bashir  Lawal, regretted that the Governors, some of whom their States have not contributed a dime to the pension funds were now desperate to collect ₦17 trillion out of it to massage their insatiable greed. The union urged the National Pension Commission (PenCom)  not to release any money from the pension funds to the governors under the guise of loan or face the wrath of millions of Nigerian workers. According to the ASCSN citing information from PenCom, as of June 2020 only four States of the Federation and the Federal Capital Territory had a reasonable level of compliance in pension fund contributions. ”Although 25 States have issued legislation on the contributory pension scheme, only four States namely Osun, Lagos, Delta, and Kaduna are in high compliance of remittance to PenCom. “In States that have Pension Schemes, retires are not paid their benefits two to six years after exiting service,” the Union regretted. The ASCSN wondered what rate of interest would be paid on the loan, how would the loan be recovered, and what collateral would be provided.
