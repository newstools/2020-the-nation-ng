D’Tigers head coach, Mike Brown  believes many teams can compete favourably with the best in the world if proper structures are put in place by African basketball federations. Teams have commenced preparations for the third window of the  Afrobasket qualifiers on February 19 to 21, 2021 which was announced by FIBA on Monday. Brown who is embarking on his first ever assignment in Africa, said there are great African players in the NBA with what he experienced at the just concluded 2021 FIBA Afrobasket qualifiers. “The game of basketball in Africa is unique from the standpoint that every team you look at possesses the athleticism necessary for the game,” Brown reportedly  said In an interview with the NBBF media.  “ Physically, they are there and we have a lot of physically gifted players. When you put all together and try to bring out maximum potential from each of these African teams, it is something that everybody is striving for.” With many teams struggling to break into the top 30 in the global ranking except for Nigeria currently ranked 23rd  and first in Africa, Brown said once many national federations invest in quality coaches and put the right structure in place, they will definitely improve drastically to become a global force.   “Now, we just have to get a little bit organized, get more coaching, a little more structure and we can compete with the best around the world. Once that is done, I think basketball in Africa is going to improve tremendously”. D’Tigers under Brown  at the Afrobasket qualifiers, had a perfect result with wins against South Sudan, Rwanda and Mali which saw the team topped  Group B with the maximum points.
