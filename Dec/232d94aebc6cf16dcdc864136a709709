The Government of the State of Osun have unveiled an elaborate plan to reposition sports by partnering with a private Company, Peculiar Ultimate Concerns Limited, in establishing a world class Sports Academy as well as revitalizing the Governor’s Cup for Secondary Schools and grassroots football development. Speaking at the flag off of the Sports Complex which will house the Sports Academy in Ileogbo, in the State, Governor Adegboyega Oyetola emphasized that the Public-Private Sector collaboration will help to empower the youths as well as lift the State to very enviable heights in Sports. Governor Oyetola said: “The Sports Academy will have a 5,000 to 6,000 capacity stadium, four training pitches for track and field events which will be 1,200 seater. There will also be classrooms and staff quarters, 18 holes golf course and a multipurpose sports arena among other top class features. We will in turn provide infrastructure, including road, power, and water for the effective functioning of the Academy.” Based on the arrangement, the private company, Peculiar Ultimate Concerns Limited will also provide two mini stadia in Ikirun and Ife as well as sponsor the Governor’s Cup, the State’s premium grassroots football competition, for five years.  Students of the academy admitted from the State of Osun, to be selected by the Government, will only pay 50 percent of the tuition fee. It is also noteworthy that in line with the efforts at grassroots sports development, Governor Oyetola has directed that the pitch of the Osogbo Township Stadium be rehabilitated.
