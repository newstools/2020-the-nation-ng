The Lagos State Police Command has banned Christmas carnivals and street parties and night clubs, as part of efforts to contain the second wave of COVID-19. It also announced the return of the 12a.m. to 4a.m. curfew regime across the state effective yesterday, warning that anyone who flouts any of the orders would be dealt with. Commissioner of Police (CP) Hakeem Odumosu gave the warnings while parading about 500 suspects arrested for not wearing face masks. Odumosu said residents must put on their face masks in public places. According to the police boss, anyone found whether in the church or mosque, market place, inside vehicle or dancing without a face mask would be apprehended and prosecuted. He also warned those who usually held handkerchiefs to use as facemasks that it would not be allowed, urging people to ensure they put on their masks to avoid being arrested. “All these people were arrested because they were not wearing nose masks. Policemen and officers are not wicked. They are merely carrying out orders that are beneficial to the health of the citizens. “Please, COVID-19 is real and I want you to know now that gathering in clubs or anywhere that social distance will not be maintained is banned. “Again, 50 per cent capacity must be maintained in churches and mosques because of the importance of human health. Consider your health before going to church or mosque. It will not be wise for you to go to a church where COVID-19 prevention rules are not obeyed. “Then, after singing and clapping hands, you fall victim to COVID-19. Avoid things that can affect your health. Consider your health before going to church or mosque. “What I am emphasizing is on the rising trend of Cuvid19 cases. Some people don’t believe that COVID-19 is real. “It is the directives from state and federal governments that they cannot afford another lockdown, hence everything humanly possible should be done now to stop further spread of COVID-19.”
