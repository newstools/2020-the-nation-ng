The Ondo State Panel of Inquiry on Police Brutality and Other Matters has insisted that all former members of the defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) accused of human rights abuses must appear to be it. It, therefore, asks the Ondo Commissioner of Police, Bolaji Salami, to direct the affected former SARS operatives to be present at its next sitting. The Ondo panel is looking into 32 petitions before it but the Chairman of the panel, Justice Adesola Sidiq said the panel would receive more petitions if it is presented. He said it was wrong for the accused former SARS operatives to be absent during its sittings. Justice Sidiq said it was necessary for some officers of the defunct SARS to appear before the panel, because of the allegations leveled against them. He said they need to appear to clear their names.
