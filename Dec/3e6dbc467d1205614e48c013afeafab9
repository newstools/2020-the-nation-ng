Edo State Head of Service Anthony Okungbowa, who was kidnapped at the weekend, has not been freed or rescued, it was learnt on Sunday. The kidnappers have also not contacted his family or his employer, Governor Godwin Obaseki. Whereabouts of Okungbowa’s police orderly, who was with him when the kidnappers took him, is also still unknown. His driver was killed. Okungbowa was returning to Benin from a social event when he ran into kidnappers on Oza Road, Orhionmwon Local Government Area. Police spokesman Chidi Nwabuzor said he was just settling down from a journey and so declined to react on efforts to rescue Okungbowa.
