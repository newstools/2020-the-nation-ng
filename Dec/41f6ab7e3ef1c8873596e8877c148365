The Lagos Police Command said on Saturday it had launched an investigation into the death of socialite, Dapo Ojaro. Ojora, an in-law to former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, allegedly shot himself on the head Friday evening at his Lagos residence. The development immediately sparked a controversy on the social media with some people suggesting a conspiracy theory. But the police on Saturday called for caution against speculations. Police spokesman, Olumuyiwa Adejobi, said circumstances surrounding Dapo Ojora’s  death were being investigated. His words: “The Lagos State Police Command therefore urges the public to disregard media speculations making waves on the cause of his death until the investigation instituted by the Commissioner of Police, Lagos State, CP Hakeem Odumosu, to unravel the cause of his death is concluded and the findings made public. “The police command condemns all sorts of speculations making round in the media. These are not only unfounded and baseless, but could jeopardise police investigation on Dapo’s death. “The Commissioner of Police, CP Hakeem Odumosu, while commiserating with the family, friends and business partners of the deceased, assures that police experts in the Homicide Section of the command’s State CID will do the needful on the investigation,” he said. Friends of the deceased paid tributes to him on the social media. Business mogul, Atedo Peterside, said: “My good friend, Dapo Ojora, passed on yesterday. Rather than simply comforting his children, spouse and family, I am disgusted that some are seeking to apportion blame. Death is a very complex subject. Can we please just condole and support them at this difficult time?” Dapo is one of the sons of Otunba Adekunle Ojora, a business mogul, and the elder brother to Toyin Saraki, wife of the ex-Senate President.
