 AIICO Insurance Plc has received the shareholders’ approval to increase its authorised share capital from N18 billion to N20 billion by the creation of additional four billion ordinary shares of 50 kobo each. The shareholders spoke at the company’s virtual 50th Annual General Meeting in Lagos. They gave their nod for the declaration of one bonus share for every eight ordinary shares held by existing shareholders of the company as at December 28, 2020 payable from retained earnings and 1 bonus share for every five ordinary shares held by existing shareholders of the company as at December 28, 2020 paid from share premium. The company’s Chairman, Mr. Kundan Sainani, assured the shareholders of the Board’s commitment to continue to steer the affairs of the company on the path of continuous and sustainable progress, irrespective of daunting macro-economic challenges. The Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Babatunde Fajemirokun, further shed some light on the satisfactory progress the company has made in its recapitalisation journey, having surpassed the December 2020 expectations of the Regulator. “There are no doubts that we have made some giant strides along this path. Beyond just meeting the requirements, we have seen the potentials and value this exercise brings and have positioned ourselves to take full advantage for value creation, both in the short and long term. “AIICO will emerge stronger and with greater capacity to underwrite more risks,” he noted.
