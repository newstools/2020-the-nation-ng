 A CHIEFTAIN of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Cross River State, Jarigbe Agom, has berated the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for declaring Dr. Stephen Odey as the winner of the by-election in Cross River North Senatorial District. Agom and Odey contested for the PDP ticket. A statement by his campaign organisation said INEC ignored the decision of the High Court, which declared Agom the candidate. “We are, therefore, surprised that the returning officer unilaterally and without justification imported a name of a purported candidate of PDP as the winner of the Northern Senatorial by-election of Cross River State, even when INEC had not declared anyone candidate, prior to the election. “We are aware of a similar situation in Imo North Senatorial District by-election where the issue of candidature is still in court; INEC declared the party winner pending the determination of the court cases.”
