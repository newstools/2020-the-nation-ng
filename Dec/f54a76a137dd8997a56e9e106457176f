Tajudeen Ajide, has been honoured as the 2020 most outstanding sport philanthropist by the Sports Legendary Awards (SLA). According to Solomon Omonokhua, the CEO and national coordinator of SLA, the annual award identifies, nominates and reward outstanding sporting heroes, pacesetter, corporate organizations and stake holders of various sports in Nigeria and Africa. According to a Statement issued by the organization Ajide has contributed immensely towards development of sports in the country. Speaking during the award presentation, Omonokhua said Ajide was singled out for his excellent track record and outstanding character, especially in the area of sports philanthropy and peacemaking. “We have taken time to follow your exploit over the years. You stand out in sport philanthropy as you have touched the life of more ex-players and ex-internationals than any other. “You are an apostle of peace and this is well demonstrated in the manner with which you reconciled the two Player Union factions that have worked at cross purpose for about 30 years. It is because of these and more that we found you worthy of this award.” It would be recalled that Ajide received another award on education a fortnight ago. Other awardees honoured are governor of Kebbi State, Senator Abubaka Bagudu Governor Aminu Tambuwa of Sokoto state and Dr Nasiru Yusuf Gawuna , Deputy Governor of Kano State.
