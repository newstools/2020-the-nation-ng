Abike Dabiri-Erewa, Chairman /CEO, Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM) has condemned in strong terms the killing of Mr George Nkencho, a 27- year old Nigerian in Ireland. Dabiri-Erewa described the killing of the young Nigerian allegedly by a Police officer as callous and wicked. She has therefore called for a full, thorough and fair investigation into the matter. NiDCOM boss in a statement by Abdur-Rahman Balogun, NIDCOM Head of Media and Public Relations, also appealed to the obviously enraged Nigerian community in Ireland to exercise patience and await the outcome of an investigation into the unfortunate incident. She also condoled with the family of Nkencho and the Nigerian community in Ireland over the killing of George and prayed to God to give the family and friends the fortitude to bear the irreplaceable loss. Already, the African Advocacy Network Ireland (AANI) has expressed shock to learn about the callous shooting dead of George Nkencho on Wednesday, December 30. The group said the circumstances surrounding the killing of a mentally challenged young man has enraged the African community and demanded a full independent public inquiry.
