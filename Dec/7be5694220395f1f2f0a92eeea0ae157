They were arrested alongside the manager of the venue one Dungu Ivan and the Events manager Prim Kasana. Confirming the arrest, Luk Owoyesigyire, the Assistant Superintendent of Police and Deputy Police Spokesperson, Kampala Metropolitan Police in a statement released on Twitter, wrote; “Nigerian Artist Omah lay has been arrested by Katwe police, the manager of the venue one Dungu Ivan and the Events manager Prim Kasana are also in custody.  “Temilade Openiyi Aka Ms Tems (Artist) also been arrested with her manager Muyiwa Awomiyi.” According to the Ugandan news outlet, The Independent, the organizers of the event disguised the show as a lunch and dinner event but later on, at night started inviting artists to perform. The concert took place on Saturday after the singer and organizers were warned from performing at the concert. The concert contravenes President Museveni’s directives on social gatherings in a bid to curb the spread of COVID-19. The president placed a ban on all music concerts, closed down bars, banned fans at all sporting events and reduced the number of people who could attend church services.
