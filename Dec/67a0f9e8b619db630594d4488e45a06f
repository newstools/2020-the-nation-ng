The Katsina State Police Command has arrested Khamis Abdullahi for posing as a captain in the Air Force. Spokesman Gambo Isa, in a statement on Tuesday, said Abdullahi was arrested after a tip-off. “The command arrested Khamis Abdullahi of W02 Quarters, NDA, Kaduna State, a notorious fraudster and thief, who specialises in defrauding the public using fake bank transfer alerts and other similar tricks. “Nemesis caught up with the hoodlum when he dressed in the Air Force uniform, bearing the name K. Abdullahi, with a captain rank. He approached one Muhammadu Girka, a car dealer, introduced himself as a Air Force captain who returned from the United Kingdom (UK) and posted to Katsina on special duty as a Pilot. “He demanded to buy a car, valued at N5.4 million, and promised to pay later.” Gambo added that Abdullahi invited the car dealer to meet him at the bank and collect his money. He deceitfully filled a bank transfer form, stamped it with his fabricated stamp and asked the victim to sign. The suspect later created a fake bank alert and showed it to the victim who believed him and took the vehicle to an unknown destination. According to Isa, the suspect was accosted with the vehicle at Hunkuyi Junction, on the Danja/Zaria Road. He has confessed to committing the crime. The command also announced the rescue of 12 kidnap victims in Gatakawa village, Kankara Local Government Area.
