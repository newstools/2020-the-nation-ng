Anthony Joshua plans to beat Tyson Fury before defeating his heavyweight rival again in a rematch. The two are expected to meet in 2021 after AJ beat Kubrat Pulev to retain his world heavyweight belts. Fury is WBC king having stopped Deontay Wilder in February with a blockbuster clash expected to happen sometime in the next 12 months. There are hopes that it will be for the undisputed title, though those plans could be stopped by Joshua’s WBO mandatory challenger Oleksandr Usyk.  Joshua said: “Will people care if I have to lose a belt to Usyk? Will I have to give one up? I am not too sure yet. “I don’t want to, because it is ‘the road to undisputed’. But I know that, when I win, I will go back and fight for that belt anyway — that will be my goal. “I want to fight Fury, beat him again in the rematch — two difficult hurdles, serious fights — then I will go straight back to try to fight for that title again. “I don’t know what Fury’s situation is with Wilder. My situation is, do I give up the WBO or will Usyk step aside?” Joshua’s promoter Eddie Hearn expects the WBO to allow Joshua to steer around Usyk in order to face Fury.
