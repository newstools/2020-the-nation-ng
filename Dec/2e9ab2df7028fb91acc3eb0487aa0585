A support group, APC Professionals Forum of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), has urged the Yobe State Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the party to ensure fairness and transparency in the conduct of the forthcoming party membership registration and re-validation. It also urged the party leadership to be inclusive, reconciliatory, selfless and diplomatic in the discharge of its new mandate for the next six months. The forum’s National Coordinator Akeem Akintayo stated this while addressing reporters yesterday at the party’s national secretariat in Abuja. The coordinator maintained that it was only in being transparent with the registration that the party could come clean about insinuations and suspicion that heralded the exercise. “We call on the party’s leadership to ensure fairness and transparency in the forthcoming registration, starting from the second week of January 2021. We urge the leadership of the party to harmonise the interest of both new and old members in their efforts to drive the party for electoral victory in 2023,” he said. “To this end, we trust that the interim party leaders would be transparent, inclusive, reconciliatory, selfless and diplomatic in the discharge of their new mandate for the next six months. “We appeal to the leadership once again to ensure fairness and transparency in the process of registration of new members in order to discourage innuendos and suspicion in the exercise. “We are APC and we must continue to dwell on our core values of engagements and consultations as we manage our affairs.”
