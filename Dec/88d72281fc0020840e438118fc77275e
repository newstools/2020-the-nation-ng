 WE are in the season of parties again despite the challenges of a pandemic. There are so many celebrations to attend during this festive period. Most Christmas holidays are reserved for parties, family outings, dinners, get-togethers with friends and associates, dates, clubbing, cocktails, birthdays and so on. These events often require heavy dressing and different dress codes. Below are some ideas on what to wear from sequins party dresses, high heels to trendy accessories. We have got some style inspirations for a stylish celebration. The ideal outfit would be chic, comfortable, polished and warm. Go for golden glamour in a shimmer dress. Keep your look sparkly and fun with studded heels, along with a faux fur trimmed blazers, shrug or bolero jacket. Just make sure that whatever you choose, you manage to look sophisticated and elegant. Pair this outfit with strappy heels and a clutch or small purse to complete the look. You cannot go wrong with a black little dress or knee-length dress. You can throw on a nicely cut blazer in red or green to embrace the season’s spirit. Finish off with trendy well-balanced pumps, if you feel up to it and a cute clutch purse. Just rock whatever makes you feel comfortable — since there is no dress code. This look is about dressing and feeling comfortable and sophisticated at the same time. Therefore, pick shoes with small heels.
