  Nigerians have been advised to use opportunities offered by Rotary to cater for their health. Oba of Ketu Isiaka Balogun Oyero gave the advice during The Rotary Family Health Days. He said the programme had no political or economic undertone. He said Rotary came to the community because he was a member, and thanked Rotary Club of Gbagada for the gesture. The club’s President Yemi Ogunlade said the programme was aimed at offering Nigerians free health, adding that their health status was vital to their longevity. He said beneficiaries were tested and given free drugs, adding that those with cataract would receive free surgery at the Onabisi Onabanjo University, Ago Iwoye, Ogun State. Ogunlade praised members for their contributions to the success of the programme, saying they spent over N3 million to host it. The club’s Service Project Chairman Afolabi Oluwasanu said 300 people benefited from the programme, describing it as well attended compared to last year’s.
