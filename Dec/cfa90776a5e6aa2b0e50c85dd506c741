 THE Association of Market Women and Men in Odi-Olowo/Ojuwoye Local Council Development Area (LCDA) have appealed to Lagos State to look into their challenges. The Iyaloja of Irepodun Market, Mrs. Mufuliat Adebunmi, who spoke on their behalf in Mushin, claimed that many markets in Lagos were facing leadership crises, which had limited their viability. According to her, markets such as Daleko, Abibatu Mogaji, Aranmoleti Eso, Idita, Iponri, Irepodun, were facing disunity and high-handedness by some market women and men parading themselves as market leaders. Mrs. Mufuliat blamed the situation on maladministration and incompetence of market leaders who were appointees rather than elected, as it should be in a democracy. She appealed to the Iyaloja-General, Mrs. Folashade Tinubu, to work towards ensuring that every market, especially Irepodun Market, gets the leadership and dividend it deserves to restore peace and harmony in the market.
