 THE refusal of the gunmen, who kidnapped the Auxiliary Bishop of Owerri Catholic Archdiocese, Most Rev. Moses Chikwe and his driver, Mr. Ndubuisi Robert, to establish contact with the church and the victims’ families, three days after their abduction, is causing anxiety and disquiet among residents in Imo State. The Archbishop of the Owerri Catholic Archdiocese, Most Rev. Anthony Obinna, has urged Catholics and others to disregard a report that Bishop Chikwe has been killed by his abductors. The cleric was kidnapped by gunmen suspected to be abductors alongside his driver  around World Bank area of Owerri on Sunday evening. His vehicle was later found in front of Maria Assumpta Cathedral, the archdiocesan headquarters, in Owerri. It was gathered on Wednesday that the kidnappers were yet to establish contact with the church and the victims’ families. This is causing anxiety among Catholic faithful and residents. However, following the rumours of the killing of the bishop in the social media, the Head of the Owerri Catholic Ecclesiastical Province, Archbishop Anthony Obinna, has urged people to disregard the news.
