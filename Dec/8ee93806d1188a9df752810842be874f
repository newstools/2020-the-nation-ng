THE year 2020 can be best described as a roller coaster. It’s a year filled with many highs and many lows. For practitioners in the entertainment industry, deaths and births, new deals, endorsements, COVID-19, and #EndSARS protests gave challenges and good news to different individuals. From Cynthia Morgan’s return to Omah Lay and Tem’s musical rise and arrest in Uganda, 2020 for entertainers remains a memory not to be forgotten in a lifetime to different players. Wizkid released his album after three years of wait and united his three sons from different mothers in a music video. The year also had Davido’s youngest signee, Lil Frosh getting kicked out of the highly sought DMW by Davido after abusing his lover; Naira Marley taking a back seat in the EndSARS protest after he was arraigned for flouting the COVID-19 restrictions guidelines; Rema’s outburst at PDP over his father’s death to Falz taking a prominent seat during the EndSARS protest; Emanuella buying her mother a luxurious home, Duncan Mighty accusing his wife of misuse of funds to Temi Otedola making her first appearance in a Nollywood movie. The Nation Entertainment team, SAM ANOKAM, ADENIYI ADEWOYIN, SAMPSON UNAMKA, OLAITAN GANIU, led by GBENGA BADA compiled a long list of the biggest newsmaker in the entertainment world in 2020.
