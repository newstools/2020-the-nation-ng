Kidnapped Chinese worker of the Chinese Civil Engineering Construction Company (CCECC) building the Ado-Iyin road has been freed. Suspected herdsmen last Friday abducted the expatriate when he visited the site. His security detail was killed. A source within the construction company said the victim was released about 11pm on Tuesday after N100 million was paid. The source said while the money was collected in Kwara State, the victim was released on the Ilawe-Igede road in Ekiti State after spending four days in the kidnappers’ den “The Chinese was released very late on Tuesday after N100 million was paid. The money was taken to a bush in Kwara State before the man was released here on Igede-Ilawe road.” Police spokesman Sunday Abutu confirmed the victim’s release but denied payment of ransom. He said the victim was left off the hook after a coordinated manhunt was launched on the kidnappers. “Yes, he was released after a serious manhunt and pressure from the security operatives around Ilawe-Igede about 11:30pm yesterday (Tuesday).” He assured residents that the command would continue to do everything possible to contain criminals and ensure maximum security of lives and property.
