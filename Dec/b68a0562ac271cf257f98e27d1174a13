 Frank Donga and Tito Da Fire have been named ambassadors for the Nigerian Conservation Foundation (NCF) Save Vulture brand. The entertainers were named alongside Mariam Longe as the new ambassadors of the advocacy. The ambassadorial position was given to the trio in Lagos at Lekki Conservation Centre (LCC) in recognition of their advocacy for the protection of vultures. While handing over the symbolic plaque of recognition to the duo, the Director-General of NCF, Dr. Muhtari Aminu-Kanu, thanked the entertainers for the good work they were doing in the protection and conservation of nature, especially, vultures. Musician and singer, Tito Da Fire (known as Uduak Peters), promised to take the “Save Vulture” advocacy beyond the boundaries of social media. He said he was prepared to go the extra mile in having interpersonal discussions with traditionalists who made use of vultures in their practice. Also, popular TV presenter Mariam Longe vowed to take the “Save Vulture’’ campaign to schools. According to her, it is important to teach the younger generation the importance of vultures in the maintenance of balance in the eco-system. Earlier, Dr. Joseph Onoja, Director, Technical Programmes, NCF, in his presentation, said that vultures were gradually becoming an endangered species with 95 percent of some species gradually going into extinction. Onoja attributed the decline in the number of vultures to direct persecution, poisoning, and death.
