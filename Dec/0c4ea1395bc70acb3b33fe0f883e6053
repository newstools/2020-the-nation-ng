Former United star Owen Hargreaves has insisted that the Nigeria international Wilfred Ndidi  is a player destined to help  his old team currently under manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Hargreaves  said as much after watching  Ndidi marshalled  the defense line of Leicester City in their recent 2-2 draw against Manchester United , adding  the Nigerian  who  has been  central to the Foxes’ recent success, has world-class defensive qualities. Ndidi , according to Hargreaves  in an interview with manchestereveningnews.com, has showcased what he could bring to this United side.  He said: “That’s one player (Ndidi) – look at the impact it’s made. If they could get one or two more of those types of players. Liverpool did it with Alisson and Van Dijk. It’s not quantity, it’s quality. Bruno has been nothing but quality since he’s arrived.” Meanwhile, in the  statistics of the tie,  the tabloid claimed : “Ndidi made seven tackles against United  and was more than any other player on the field. His defensive contribution also led to Leicester’s equaliser. He was quick to close down Bruno Fernandes as United looked to counter and denied the Portuguese from playing the ball through his legs. Leicester would score through Harvey Barnes from the subsequent attack. “Ndidi would be the perfect successor for Matic and allow Fernandes the licence to create and feed United’s attackers. At 24, he is still improving yet is proven in the Premier League,” the paper wrote.
