 There are no fewer than 93 monarchs – 65 of whom are first-class obas – and 10 empty stools in Lagos State. The Director, Chieftaincy, Lagos State Ministry of Local Government and Community Affairs, Mr Folami Lukman, revealed this yesterday at a stakeholders’ meeting on the Review of the Obas and Chiefs of Lagos State Law, 2015. The meeting, organised by the Directorate of Legislative Drafting, Lagos State Ministry of Justice (MoJ), featured representatives from Lagos councils, traditional institutions among others.  The session featured an interactive engagement to update the law to make it responsive to current realities. Lukman, who praised the MoJ “especially the Directorate of Legislative Drafting”, for organising the event, emphasised the need for reviewing the law. He said: “The law really needs to be upgraded. They should help us fast-track this review. Everybody wants to become Oba, chief. Even those with red blood, that are not blueblood, they want to become obas. Let us do something and help our laws and help save the state. “ “The state’s size is not increasing. As of today, we have 93 obas on ground; about 10 stools that need to be occupied.”
