A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos State, Rev. Timothy Oyasodun, is dead. Fondly called ‘Iyo’ by admirers, the politician and cleric was the chairman of the party at Bariga Counvil, Lagos East Senatorial District. The senator representing the district, Tokunbo Abiru, expressed shock at the demise of the progressive, recalling that he played a crucial role during the recent senatorial by-election. He said:”Revd Oyasodun’s death, no doubt, is a great loss to the entire progressive family in Lagos State, especially in Bariga LCDA and Somolu Local Government Area (LGA). “But we all submit to the decision of God our Creator to call him home at the early hour of December 26, 2020.” Commiserating with the family and party faithful, Abiru added: Revd Oyasodun devoted his life to serving God, humanity and Lagos APC at large. Before he emerged Chairman of Bariga APC, Revd Oyasodun had served as Secretary-General of SDP in Somolu and Kosofe LGAs. “Revd Oyadosun had also served as Secretary-General of UNCP in Somolu LGA; Secretary-General of Apex Leaders, Somolu/Bariga Alliance for Democracy and Secretary-General of Apex Leaders, Somolu/Bariga APC.
