Newcastle United’s game at Premier League rivals Aston Villa on Friday has been postponed following a “significant increase” in COVID-19 cases at the Magpies’ training ground. Several Newcastle players and staff members are self-isolating at home after returning positive test results. The club’s training ground at Darsley Park was closed on Monday and Tuesday.  Newcastle lodged a request with the Premier League to postpone the fixture at Villa Park, which was approved. Aston Villa say they “fully support” the Premier League’s decision to postpone the match. “Everybody at Aston Villa wishes a speedy recovery to all those affected by the virus,” added the club. A new date and time for the game will be confirmed in the future. This is the first Premier League fixture this season to be postponed because of COVID cases.
