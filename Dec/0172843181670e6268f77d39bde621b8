An Abia State High Court sitting in Aba on Tuesday gave an interim order restraining the Abia State Independent Election Commission (ABSIEC) from conducting the Local Government election in the state slated for December 18, pending the determination of the motion on notice. The state chapter of All Progressives Congress (APC) had dragged ABSIEC to court over issues the party said infringed on the rights of its candidates and prayed the court to stop the electoral body from taking further actions that will limit the chances of winning in the election. In his ruling, Justice Agwu Umah Kalu upon reading the motion ex-parte filed on November 26 brought in pursuant to Order 39 Rules (1) and (3) and Order Rule of the High Court Civil Procedure, the Affidavit in support of the motion and after hearing Perfect C. Okorie for the claimant, ordered for interim injunction restraining ABSIEC from taking any other step in the conducting of the election pending the determination of the motion on notice. The court equally gave order restraining the defendant from demanding from the candidates of the applicant any fee for the purpose of the election. The defendant was also restrained from refusing to issue the claimant with the relevant Forms for the election and from excluding the applicantâ€™s candidates from participating in the election on the grounds of non-payment of fees imposed by the Defendant or any other ground not supported by law pending the determination of the motion. Hearing on the substantive matter was slated for December 7, 2020.
