 THE National Ear Care Centre (NECC) in collaboration with Med-El, a hearing implant company, has conducted two cochlear implant surgeries in Kaduna State. The patients operated on were a six-year-old boy and a 46-year-old woman who had lost hearing. Addressing reporters at the hospital in Kaduna, the Chief Medical Director (CMD), Dr Mustapha Abubakar-Yaro said the Centre initially made provision for the surgery for four patients but did only two and shifted the others to another date. He said that one of the treatments for profound or total hearing loss was the cochlear implant surgery which restores hearing. The CMD noted that, despite the multimodality approach of the cochlear implant surgery, the Centre had all the equipment and personnel who were trained. “We have the audiologists, surgeons, speech rehabilitation experts and also collaboration with the Med-El group from Egypt to provide the implant and technical assistance to enable us to have a successful implant programme.”
