For a woman, there is nothing as satisfying as having a happy family and home. Star actress, Omotola Jalade-Ekeinde, has this and it is priceless to her. Omotola recently brought celebrities together for this year’s edition of Teffest, an annual festival and fair aimed at promoting the possibilities in the business of entertaining through training and trade. The two-day event which attracted top celebrities like Ebuka, Rita Dominic, comedian Bovi, Audu Maikori, Asa Asika, Bizzle Osikoya, among others was held in Lagos. Days after the event, the actress shared pictures to appreciate people who honoured and supported her. She reserved special thanks for her husband and kids. She wrote: “This is an appreciation post! Thank you to the grand man always by my side! My Ride or Die Dude! – #TheCaptain. I remember me taking a pic and wondering why my tummy decided to come out to play despite not eating well for weeks and you said … “it’s sexy! Don’t you dare do Photoshop or what’s it you guys do? You should be an example that no one is less beautiful even when not perfect!” I Love it! I love you! I own me! “I have to have the ‘dopest’ kids in Africa! What? The life of the party! Humble, kind, Considerate, Respectful, Calm… I’m so proud to be yours and you, mine! Thanks.”
