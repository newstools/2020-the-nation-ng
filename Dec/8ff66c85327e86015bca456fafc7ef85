 Pension investments are insured, the Managing Director, Access Pension Fund Custodian (PFC), Mrs. Idu Okwuosa. She spoke at the Pension Fund Operators Association of Nigeria (PenOp) yearly seminar for reporters in Lagos. At the virtual event, Okwuosa said: “The public should be assured that all pension assets are traded in the name of the Pension Fund Administrator (PFA) and Pension Fund Custodian (PFC); in other words, the investments are made in the PFA/PFC’s name. “The returns are not paramount to the National Pension Commission (PENCOM) or operators, as much as the safety of the funds. Contributors under the Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS) can be rest assured the PFAs and PFCs together with the regulator, PenCom will continue to ensure the safety of pension assets for the benefit of all contributors,” she noted. Meanwhile, Head of Media, Communications and Branding Committee, PenOp, Mrs Amaka Andy-Azike said the association has lined up a lot of programmes and is looking forward to more media interactions in the coming year, which would help enhance public education on pension. She noted that knowledge sharing and information dissemination is important to the industry’s growth. Mrs Andy-Azike said: “The media and branding committee of PenOp plans to do a lot to improve on knowledge advocacy and information sharing provided that the pandemic gives way to more social interaction. We plan to have a pension awareness week, like a pension fair where operators attend to individuals on the spot with media partners available for coverage. “We also intend to participate in World Saving Day to drive financial inclusion as 11 per cent of the active workforce are enrolled in contributory and micro pension schemes and this number needs to improve.”
