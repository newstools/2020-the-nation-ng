Pep Guardiola cannot guarantee Sergio Aguero will play a prominent role for Manchester City against Southampton after the forward missed two days of training this week. Aguero, who has endured fitness setbacks in the wake of knee surgery, made his first league appearance since October in Tuesday’s 1-1 draw with West Brom. He played only 14 minutes and Guardiola revealed the Argentina striker did not return to training until Friday after suffering a problem unrelated to his knee. Asked how much Aguero could be involved on Saturday, Guardiola replied: “I don’t know. After the game he could not train, yesterday no training, today he trained. “He trained really well but I don’t know how many minutes [he will play against Southampton]. “It’s important he can make training sessions. Unfortunately after the game he could not, nothing about the knee. Unfortunately a different position. Today he trained.” The draw with West Brom followed a goalless stalemate in the derby with Manchester United and led to more questions about a lack of goals in Guardiola’s team. According to Opta, City have converted 30 per cent of their “big chances,” and only relegation-threatened Sheffield United, West Brom and Burnley have fared worse in this regard in 2020-21. But Guardiola does not see their issues in front of goal getting to the point where he will consider bringing in a new forward. The former Barcelona boss pointed to the long-term performance of Gabriel Jesus and the absence of Aguero as reasons not to rush into the transfer market in January.
