 Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta is frustrated with his side’s lack of goals in the Premier League and hopes their consistency in cup competitions will help them rediscover their touch to stop their slide down the table. Arteta said Arsenal have had “really good runs” in other competitions, where they are through to the Europa League knockouts with a perfect record in the group stage and are also in the quarter-finals of the League Cup. But Arsenal have managed just one victory in their seven most recent league games, and recorded just 10 goals in their last 11 Premier League matches. That has left them 15th in the league and 11 points of leaders and local rivals, Spurs. “We are very frustrated with that and we know how important it is to put those results together really quickly, because we need them straight away,” Arteta said in a press conference before Sunday’s match against Burnley.
