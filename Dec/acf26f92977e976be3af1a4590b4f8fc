Two persons were on Thursday electrocuted in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital. The victims, Mr. Oladeji Olatunji Kango, and Mrs. Kemi Adegoke, were both on a commercial motorcycle when live electricity wire fell on them. The incident happened around Iwo-Adogba road of the capital city. A source explained that Mr. Oladeji, the commercial motorcyclist, carried Mrs. Adegoke in the motorcycle and the two were heading to another location when the electricity wire snapped. They were immediately rushed to the nearby hospital but effort to save their lives was futile as they were confirmed dead. In a swift reaction, the management of Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company (IBEDC) said it has commenced investigation into what led to the situation. While commiserating with families of the deceased in a statement, the company said its engineers are already carrying out safety routine maintenance to forestall such occurrences. The statement reads: “The management of Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company (IBEDC) Plc hereby deeply commiserates with the families of Mr. Oladeji Olatunji Kango and Mrs. Kemi Adegoke who died as a result of an electrical accident that happened along Iwo/Adogba road, Oyo State. “We are currently working with families of the deceased at this difficult period to help provide some measure of succour. “Investigations have begun to ascertain the facts of the case, whilst all necessary protocols and reports to the regulatory authorities have been initiated. “Our team of engineers is already carrying out safety routine maintenance to forestall such occurrences.” A close source to one of the deceased victims informed that even before the investigation was concluded, the electricity company has taken the responsibility of the burial of the victims; a measure which he said gave a sense of succor to the family.
