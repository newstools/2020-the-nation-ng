 The lawmaker representing Apapa Federal Constituency, Mufutau Egberongbe, has donated relief materials to flood victims in Oke Oja area of Apapa Local Government, Lagos State. Speaking at the event held at Arakan Primary School, Apapa, he said some residents of Oke Oja experienced flood during the last rainy season, which rendered some homeless and some died. The legislator said this necessitated his visit to the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to request for relief materials on behalf of the victims.  Egberongbe, who also gave cash to the people, said: “Oke Oja, a community in Apapa Local Government, was ravaged by flood during the last rainy season and it brought a devastating situation to my people, resulting even in loss of lives. “So this necessitated my visit to NEMA and to God be the glory, they gave us relief materials. “The NEMA officials had come at a time, they did enumeration, they assessed the area and did evaluation and all the households were compiled. These households are the ones we are presenting with these items today. I just added some cash incentives for my people, in the mood of the festive period.” Items donated include 750 bags of rice, beans, garri, cartons of vegetable oil, bags of salt, bags of cement, mattresses, roofing sheets, bags of nails, ceiling cardboards, blankets, among others.
