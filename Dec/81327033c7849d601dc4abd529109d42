 Doctors and laboratory scientists have again expressed fears over the second wave of the covid-19 pandemic. Their worry stemmed from the fact that the majority of Nigerians are not adhering to the safety protocols by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). They stressed that the second wave may prove more destructive to the health of Nigerians and the health sector as a whole, as people no longer wear face masks, don’t wash their hands with soap and water, and don’t sanitise their hands. Speaking with The Nation, the President of the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD), Dr. Uyilawa Okhuaihesuyi, said: “NARD has always emphasised that a second wave is on the way and we need to take up precautionary measures. The Federal Government has tried to educate Nigerians about a second wave and measures to take to prevent the spread of covid-19. However, most Nigerians have not taken to this call, which is causing the pandemic to spread the more. “Our people need to be educated about the virus; we need to let them know that the pandemic is not over and that it is real. A proper record of deaths from covid-19 is lacking – that is why some Nigerians don’t believe in the second wave, and some believe it is a sham and means of the government to get money. Also, in an interview with The Nation, the President of the Association of Medical Laboratory Scientists of Nigeria (AMLSN), Prof. James Damen, said: “The government needs to enforce the safety precautions, that is, non-pharmaceutical methods. People must be forced to ensure that they wear their face masks, use sanitiser, wash their hands regularly with water and soap and observe social distancing.”
