The Ogun State Police Command has retrieved the body of a man said to have died during a cult clash from five suspected cultists. Babatunde Shittu (25); Ayobami Morenikeji (15); Fidelis John (23); Abdullah Adegbenro (17) and Oyeyemi Bakare (20) were arrested on Monday in Ota while taking the body to an unknown destination. Residents alerted the Sango Police Area Command Headquarters and the suspects were arrested while on rampage. Police spokesman Abimbola Oyeyemi said the suspects claimed they were returning from a Lagos party when a fight broke out and the deceased was hit by a vehicle. Abimbola said the suspects were taking the body to their attackers – Omo ekun, Lampad and Anko – for a reprisal when they were arrested. He added that they had damaged a Highlander jeep (KJA 275GD) belonging to Emmanuel Adekoya, snatched Falola Olushola’s phone and N50,000 from Emmanuel Agbaje before then. According to him, the body was deposited at the Ifo General Hospital mortuary for autopsy. Commissioner of Police Edward Ajogun has directed that the suspects be transferred to the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (SCIID) for further investigation.
