 A NON-GOVERNMENTAL Organisation, Tabitha Care Ministry, has lifted military widows at the Sam Ethnan Air Force Base in Ikeja, Lagos. About 120 widows were treated to foodstuffs, clothes, free medicals and a party. The event was themed ‘Make A Widow Smile’. The Visioner of Tabitha Care Ministry, Pastor Martha Adejoh, said the gesture was to put smile on their faces and boost their confidence. She said: “I decided to do this because I’m led by God. I’ve watched and listened to some  victims of widowhood and I realised that less attention is paid to military widows. I have friends who are victims and the dehumanisation and injustice meted out to widows is unimaginable. Hence, I decided to contribute towards alleviating their plight…” Mrs. Pauline Phillip, a widow for over 27 years, shared her experience and urged her fellow widows to be prayerful and motivated. She said: ”The gesture would salvage the wretched situation of widows in the community as poverty, hunger and malnutrition are great threats to their livelihood. “It hasn’t been easy but with God and prayers, things have been good. I am happy that Tabitha Care Ministry organised this programme to alleviate our spirits.”
