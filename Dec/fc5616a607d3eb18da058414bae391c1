 AN #EndSARS protest leader in Osun State, Emmanuel Adebayo (aka Captain) has been arrested by officials of the Department of State Service (DSS) for alleged impersonation. The Nation learnt that Adebayo was arrested for posing as an officer of the Nigerian Army after a petition addressed to the DSS Command. Adebayo led the second wave of #EndSARS protest in Osogbo on Monday. He led some youths to march on the House of Assembly. Another protest leader, Femi Farombi Jnr, said Adebayo was invited by the DSS and has not been released since then. “He was invited on Tuesday by DSS. He told us that Kolawole Amoo called him to come to DSS command for questioning concerning #EndSARS protest. He honoured the invitation and that was last thing we heard about him. He left his phone with someone before going to the DSS office. “We were in touch with some persons inside the DSS office and they said Adebayo would just be questioned and then let him. But, yesterday (Wednesday), things started to go awry and we did not hear anything from them again. They stopped picking calls, and so we are trying to get a lawyer to find out what is wrong because the last set of people who went to the DSS office were denied access.”
