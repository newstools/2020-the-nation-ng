Former Lagos State Deputy Governor and Education Commissioner, Mrs. Sarah Adebisi Sosan, was among experts who lauded the creation of a virtual coaching and training platform to help people re-train after unplanned job losses. She was joined by Group Managing Director, Prima Garnet, Lagos, Lolu Akinwunmi; the Managing Director, Risk Analyst Insurance Brokers Limited, Mrs. Funmi Babington-Ashaye; and others who underscored the need for a platform that allows Nigerians to upgrade their skills and get the needed support to continue earning an income. The virtual platform, Pathfinda, offers vocational education training, capacity development programmes, as well as business clinics and pre-retirement planning among others. Chairman, Pathfinda Consulting Ltd, Hannah Oyebanjo, said the platform was necessary given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on national life. “The global pandemic has left a lot of businesses and individuals grappling for survival. On the one hand, businesses have had to make tough decisions including downsizing, cutting down salaries etc in order to survive while individuals have to find alternatives like a new job, a side business and what have you. Pathfinda offers affected businesses and individuals alike ‘a better way’ to cope with these current realities,” she said. Ms. Oyebanjo also said the platform can help employers manage the disengagement process with minimal negative impact as well as meet the need of laid-off employees to continue life with minimal disruption by helping them take risky steps including entrepreneurship or starting a business, change career path. Praising the initiative, Mr. Akinwunmi said the firm had done well in birthing a solution to pressing issues in a pandemic era.
