 The Presiding Pastor of The Synagogue Church of All Nations, Prophet T.B Joshua, has enjoined the human race generally to be our brother’s keeper, especially during this period of coronavirus, in consonance with God’s will so that the world would be a better place for us all to live in. The global evangelist, in an end-of-the-year retreat sermon, monitored on the Emmanuel TV, observed that 2020 has been a year of humility, during which the creator of the universe had humbled the whole world with strange occurrences taking over a substantial part of the year. In demonstrating this act of philanthropy, Prophet Joshua distributed thousands of branded ‘Emmanuel TV’ bags of rice and other items to the needy as palliatives to give them succor in this season of celebrations.
