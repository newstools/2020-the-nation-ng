Director-General National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) Brigadier- General Shuaibu Ibrahim has warned corps members against unauthorised trips, misuse of the social media during their service year. He spoke when he visited the NYSC Lagos Orientation Camp on Sunday where 2020 Batch B stream 1B corps members are camped. He said authorised journeys must be done with a written permission from the state coordinator otherwise the corps member would be committing an offence. While warning against cultism, cybercrime, hard drugs, and other vices, Ibrahim also counseled the fresh graduates to utilise their time in camp and the service year to take advantage of the scheme’s skill acquisition programmes. The DG praised the effort by the NCDC to ensure that the orientation camp was free from covid-19 and urged the corps members to adhere strictly to  the safety protocols during and after the camp.
