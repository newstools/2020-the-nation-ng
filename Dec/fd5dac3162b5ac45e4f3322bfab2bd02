 AWARD-WINNING freelance investigative journalist Fisayo Soyombo has trained no fewer than 300 Mass Communication students of Abraham Adesanya Polytechnic, (AAPOLY), Ijebu-Igbo, Ogun State on  practising effective journalism. At a workshop organised by the Association of Student Communicators (ASCOM), AAPOLY  chapter, he  spoke on why students should go into journalism for the right reasons. He said students who ventured into journalism for money might be  disappointed at the inception of their career. “Don’t rush into journalism because of money, it does not come that way, you might be disappointed. Money will flow in after immense hardwork, maybe two to three years after venturing into the profession” he said. Speaking about his career, Fisayo narrated how his journalism journey began and how he has been able to achieve success in the field. “There were days I wore a torn shirt under my jacket, I endured. There were days I couldn’t have the normal three daily meals, I endured;those days are gone, now I can boast of  collaborations with big companies” he said. He urged students to be risk-takers and not to lose their integrity as  journalists. “In Journalism, you build your name with consistency, reputation matters, don’t worry, everything will flow in after your recognition in the field “The biggest thing you need in Journalism is not only your writing but also your integrity; you should also know that for you to achieve something in life, something must be at stake,” he said Soyombo has won multiple awards as an investigative journalist. In  January 2020, he co-won Gatefield’s inaugural People Journalism prize for Africa (PJPA) with BBC Africa Eye’s Kiki Mordi; and in April he emerged the only African on the long list for One World Media’s International Journalist of the Year Award. Just recently, he was named winner of the Local Reporter category of the  Kurt School Awards in International Journalism.
