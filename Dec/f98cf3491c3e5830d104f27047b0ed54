Managing Director, May & Baker Nigeria Plc, Mr. Nnamdi Okafor, said the third quarter results showed the resilience of the business strategy of the group in spite of the uncertainties and decline occasioned by COVID-19 pandemic.

Okafor said continuing growth in sales underscored the increasing market shares of many key products and the success of the company’s marketing and distribution strategies. According to him, the company’s investments in research, operations and production have put it in strong position to maintain leadership in the primary Nigerian market and to consolidate its expansion across neighbouring countries in line with its vision of being the dominant pharmaceutical brand in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA). “We are delighted with the performance so far this year, and we are hopeful to sustain this. Given the general difficulties and uncertainties in the operating environment, our results are encouraging. Our shareholders are seeing the results of our perseverance,” Okafor said. While calling on the Federal Government to consider the domestic healthcare industry in its policy formulations, Okafor assured that May & Baker Nigeria will leverage its almost eight decades of operations and state-of-the-art facilities to take advantage of the emerging opportunities from the Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA). He said the company has continued its quest to diversify income sources and broaden its operations base by optimizing its World Health Organisation (WHO)-certified pharmaceutical manufacturing complex through domestic and global partnerships as well as contract manufacturing. He assured shareholders that the company is on a strong footing to sustain good returns on their investments.
