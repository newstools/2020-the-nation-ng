Operatives of the Lagos Police Command have arrested 18 suspects for clubbing in defiance to the ban on such gatherings in the state. The suspects were arrested around 11:30p.m. on Tuesday at Romeo and Juliet Night Club in Ejigbo, where they were alleged to have been dancing and drinking. Among the suspects who were paraded on Wednesday were Samuel Jombo, 46, Chibuke Agbo, 40, Tony Azubike, 38, and Loveth Nwankwo, 32. Commissioner of Police (CP) Hakeem Odumosu, who paraded them, warned against flouting of COVID-19 directives under any guise. He stressed that the police would prosecute anyone found without a facemask or at beaches or weddings. Odumosu reiterated that recreational centres have been shut down, advising parents and fun-seekers to entertain their wards and themselves at home. He warned those in the habit of organising weddings to desist as policemen would not hesitate to come there and arrest those present. The police boss also warned commercial motorists to stop the habit of keeping a mask in their vehicles and cycles, which they give to passengers without masks, noting that they were further spreading the disease. “During the first phase of COVID-19, we found out that some cyclists usually kept a mask in their vehicle, which they give passengers without a mask to use. When they get to their destination, they take it and pass it to another passenger without a mask. “What they were doing is spreading the disease further. We do not want to hear anything like that this time around. We will not take it lightly. People should ensure they have their masks at all times. “Even if you are in your private vehicle alone and you wind down your windows, you should have your mask on. If you are in the car with your family members, you must have your masks on.”
