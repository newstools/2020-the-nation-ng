 Nigeria’s leading tech-enabled automotive trading platform, Cars45 has urged Nigerians especially companies to take advantage of its fleet liquidation initiative. Its Public Relations and Communications Manager, Bemigho Awala, made this known at a Training/Workshop, organised by the Nigeria Auto Journalists Association (NAJA) in Lagos. Awala said the initiative is helping corporate firms liquidate their fleet to address liquidity challenges that they faced with. He said: “The disruption of many supply chains may trap cash that could otherwise be used to fund operations, or better manage third-party financial commitments. To this end, we are driving fleet liquidation across the country to empower many organisations. Also, because corporates and individuals are keeping their vehicles longer due to dwindling purchasing power, our GoMechanic45 services is catering for the need of preventive maintenance and scheduled servicing to maximise the lifetime value of their vehicles.  “Lastly, our Autopreneur initiative is empowering Nigerians who may have lost their jobs or suffered income loss with the opportunity to earn extra income securely and conveniently.” He reminded journalists of their power to shape conversations and setting agenda. Awala added: “The coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has caused widespread concern and economic hardship for consumers, businesses and communities across the globe. As the pandemic continues to disrupt business as usual and throws the economic outlook into uncertainty, the automotive industry is on the frontline. Journalists play a pivotal role in drawing right parallels and comparisons that can reflect in policy guidance and formulation.”
