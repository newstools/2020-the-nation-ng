Niger State House of Assembly Speaker Abdullahi Bawa Wuse and some other members in the assembly have tested positive of COVID-19. It was also learnt that a former Head of Service in Niger State has died of complications from COVID-19. But, anxiety has gripped the Assembly workers as they are scared whether they had contracted the virus or not since it was about a week ago that ministries presented budget screening in the Assembly. A source at the Assembly, who said a lot of COVID-19 tests on the members turned out positive, refused to mention other positive peopleâ€™s names. The source, however, said the Speaker was among those, who tested positive. Its Head of Protocol and Information, Alhaji Sabo, said he was not privy to the information. He, however, confirmed that COVID-19 tests were carried out on members during the week, but did not know if the results were out and who were infected. The Assembly workers and journalists have been advising themselves to go for tests since they were in close contact with some of the lawmakers during the week during the budget screening.
