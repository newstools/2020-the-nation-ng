 WORRIED by the health care challenge of the over 36,000 Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), living in the nationâ€™s capital, the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has begun free medical care for the IDPs. Wuse and Asokoro general hospitals have been designated as places for free treatment of the IDPs. The Director-General, FCT Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Dr. Abbas Idriss, yesterday told the executive members of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), FCT Council, led by the Chairman, Comrade Emmanuel Ogbeche, when he received them in his office that about 400 women IDPs have been trained in soap, pomade and antiseptic making. He said another 200 women were trained in rice padding, to ensure that the IDPs had means of livelihood. Idriss said the administration had enrolled over 1,000 children living in the IDP camps, into public schools, while uniforms and school fees were made available for them. He hailed Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) in the FCT for providing books and uniforms for the children. Ogbeche appealed to the FCT Minister, Malam Muhammad Bello, to consider appropriate funding for FEMA. The funding, he said, is important because of the tasks and responsibilities of the agency, especially advocacy, rehabilitation and assistance to those affected by disasters.
