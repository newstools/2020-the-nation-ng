 The Secretary, Nigeria Union of Pensioners (NUP), Oyo State chapter, Mr. Segun Abatan, has hailed Governor Seyi Makinde for paying more than N12billion as pension and gratuity to retirees in less than two years. The sum, which has been described as the highest paid so far by any administration in the state, is said to have been benefitted by pensioners of local governments and retired primary school teachers, among others. Abatan said no administration since 1999 had paid as much in pension and gratuity as the Governor Makinde administration had done in the past 19 months. He spoke at the presentation of cheques to about 400 retired primary school teachers of year 2012 and retired local government workers of year 2015 to the tune of N1.05billion at the secretariat, Ibadan. Abatan rated the Makinde government highest in payment of pension and gratuity with its payment of about N6billion to retired primary school teachers and local government workers and another N6billion to retired workers at the state level.
