Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu said on Wednesday that barring unforeseen circumstances, the Agege Pen Cinema flyover would be inaugurated in February. The governor, accompanied by his deputy, Dr. Obafemi Hamzat, who spoke during an inspection tour of the flyover construction site, said the project had reached an advanced stage. The flyover, which was started during the tenure of former Governor Akinwunmi Ambode, was scheduled to be inaugurated in July when Sanwo-Olu first visited the project site after taking over the reins of government. However, the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic, with subsequent lockdown, made that date unrealistic, as work was suspended. After the lockdown was lifted, Sanwo-Olu again visited the site and the contractors promised that the project would be ready for inauguration in October.  This date was again not to be, as the #EndSARS protest and subsequent massive destruction of infrastructure further led to delay in the execution Â of the project. The latest date, barring any further delay due to unforeseen circumstances, appears to be realistic, as the flyover, as seen by the governor and his entourage yesterday, has reached an advanced stage. When inaugurated, it is expected to ease traffic jam in the area.
