The ongoing attempt by the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) to unseat a member representing Etche-Omuma Federal Constituency at the National Assembly, Ephraim Nwuzi, suffered a setback at the Federal High Court Port Harcourt on Thursday. A statement signed by a former Publicity Secretary, Chris Finebone, said the Court 5 presided over by Justice Omotosho discontinued further hearing on the matter. The court adjourned the matter to January 21, 2021 following a motion of stay brought by Nwuzi through his Lawyer, Tuduru Edeh SAN, notifying the court that his client had appealed the earlier decision of the court to hear the matter amidst contentious issues of jurisdiction. Despite objections raised by the plaintiff’s Lawyer, Ifedayo Adams Adedipe SAN, Justice Omotosho ruled that for justice to be served, the matter should be stood down stand down to January 21 to receive an update on the process at the court of appeal. The PDP dragged Nwuzi, who defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC) recently, to court vowing to retrieve the legislative seat from him. Speaking after the court session, Finebone called on the PDP to carry an elephant carcass on their head and be fiddling snails with their feet. He said: “The PDP should leave Ephraim Nwuzi alone and face the giants such as Gov. Umahi of Ebonyi State and others who have left and are still leaving the PDP across the nation. “For crying out loud, the governor should concern himself with stemming the nationwide exodus the PDP is witnessing and let Nwuzi be.”
