The Bobagunwa of Ijebuland, Chief Gbenga Fetuga, has urged a socio-cultural age-group, 1983 to 1985, to prioritise the development of Ijebuland. He advised them to also remain devoted and contribute their quota to the development of Ogun East Senatorial District and the state in general. The new age-group now awaiting a befitting name from the Awujale and Paramount Ruler of Ijebuland, Oba  Sikiru Adetona, were given the advice during their one year anniversary held in Ijebu-Ode. Fetuga, the chairman of the event, hailed the young men for deeming it fit to imbibe the rich cultural value of the Ijebu by organising themselves into age grade just like their elder brothers and sisters. Highlight of the occasion included installation of Alhaji Moriwu Olukayode Bakare and Mrs Sakirat Ajoke Agbaje as the Patron (Baba Egbe) and Matron (Iya Egbe) of the group, while Shamsudeen Olaide Onanuga was inaugurated as the Male Adviser, Asiwaju Ayo Osisanya as the Akeweje Okunrin, Otun Giwa Titilope Gafar, Eta Giwa Remi Adebowale among others.
