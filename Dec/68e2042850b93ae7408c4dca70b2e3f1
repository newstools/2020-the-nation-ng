 The Lagos State Physical Planning Permit Authority (LASPPPA) has held a two-day Road Show and Public Sensitisation  in Alimosho, Ikorodu and Agege local government areas. The General Manager (GM) LASPPPA Funmi Osifuye said: “The Road Show, as part of the overall publicity and advocacy campaign of LASPPPA, is aimed at making voluntary compliance a norm among the building publics and stakeholders while also further registering the importance of having communities that are orderly and strategically planned to ensure safety of lives and property.” Assuring that the campaign would be extended to other local governments, the GM said LASPPPA monitoring and enforcement team has been reenergised. “It is our belief that the implementation of this campaign will help ensure the targeted messages on LASPPPA activities, mandates and renewed enforcement drive permeates the public domain more effectively. We are committed to the drive to ensure that citizens become aware that they can effortlessly process and obtain valid planning permit, without recourse to third party or quacks,” Osifuye said. He noted that through the campaign, citizens, property owners, builders and developers would be educated on the requirements to obtain valid planning permit. The GM added that the campaign was also intended to expand the feedback mechanism and grievance redress channel that could be explored by the public in registering their dissatisfaction with process of obtaining a planning permit or a breach of physical planning laws. “The expanded feedback mechanism and grievance redress channel will assist us in effectively monitoring operations at our district town planning offices,” Osifuye stated. He noted that improved compliance with physical planning regulations would help reduce and possibly halt the spate of collapsed building and distressed structures in Lagos with attendants’ protection of lives and properties.
