Ekiti State House of Assembly has condemned the manner in which the appointments of some workers of the Ekiti State University (EKSU) and College of Health Technology were terminated. It said such actions by the two institutions were antithetical to the five pillars of Governor Kayode Fayemi-led government and its good governance agenda for the people. The Chairman of the House Committee on Public Petition, Adegoke Olajide, stated this yesterday during an interface between the committee and the management of the College of Health Technology, Ijero Ekiti and Ekiti State University, over the recent termination of appointment of some workers of the two state-owned institutions. The chairman, reacting to the letters submitted to it by the sacked workers, frowned at the indiscriminate termination of appointment being witnessed recently.
