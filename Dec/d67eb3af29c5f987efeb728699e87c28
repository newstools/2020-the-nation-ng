A baker, identified as Seyi, and four others were on Thursday feared killed after violence broke out on Governor’s Road, Ikotun, a Lagos community. Seyi and three others were said to have been killed while another victim’s head was smashed at Lawal Bus Stop. Trouble allegedly started about 10am when members of rival cult groups clashed in Ikotun. Reasons for the clash were unknown, but it was learnt that a biker, a member of another group, was dragged down from the bike and shot. “They were about eight men on Lasisi Ige Street about 10am when the biker drove past. They identified him as a rival cult member, dragged him down and shot him. They used a stone to smash his head. “The deceased’s mother is a prophetess in a white-garment church. We heard he was told to isolate himself and pray but he did not listen,” said a resident who preferred to be anonymous. It was learnt that residents who initially fled contributed money and evacuated the body to the mortuary before reporting to the police. Commissioner of Police Hakeem Odumosu said one person was killed and three others arrested. “The DPO and his men have been on ground. It was a cult clash and the situation has been brought under control. We have been arresting suspects,” Odumosu said.
