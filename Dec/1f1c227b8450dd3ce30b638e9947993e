Sergio Aguero has not returned to training ahead of Manchester City’s Champions League trip to Porto today but manager Pep Guardiola maintains the problem is not serious. City’s record goal scorer missed Saturday’s 5-0 thrashing of Burnley in the Premier League with what was described as a minor “disturbance” in his knee. The striker underwent knee surgery in the summer and his comeback this season has already been complicated by a hamstring injury. He returned as a late substitute in last Wednesday’s victory over Olympiacos but City does not want to take undue risks with the 32-year-old. He now seems unlikely to be involved as City, who is already qualified for the last 16, face Porto in their next Group C game.  Speaking at his pre-match press conference, Guardiola said: “I am not concerned. He did not train. He had a little disturbance in his knee. It is nothing serious but he didn’t train.” City have won their first four games in the group and securing top spot is all that is riding on the remaining two fixtures. It could be an opportunity for Guardiola to rest players as he focuses on the Premier League but he insists he will not rotate his squad for the sake of it. He said: “I am thinking about it. Some players are going to play who didn’t play the previous game are going to play. “There are a lot of games but I don’t want them to feel this is rotation. Every game is played because the best players, for many circumstances, we believe are focused on a specific game.” City are hoping to maintain momentum after their impressive performance at the weekend. Goalkeeper Ederson said: “It was a good game from the whole team. We totally neutralised Burnley. “We scored five and had a lot of chances to score more. Hopefully we can go in with the same.
