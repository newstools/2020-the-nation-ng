The decisions of Nasarawa State Governor, Abdullahi Sule, to block all loopholes in the state’s finance system and restructure the civil service for efficiency appears to have offended some bigwigs within and outside the North-central state’s workforce. Sentry gathered that on account of these reforms some forces are ganging up against the engineer-turned politician’s second term bid. On assumption of office, the governor had vowed that his administration will be committed to accountability and transparency, in the interest of development. “We will block all leakages to ensure that all revenue accrue to the state coffer, as government is not about personal benefit,” he promised. It appeared that the governor did not waste time in carrying out the promised reforms. Today, Nasarawa state civil service has moved from analog to digital and made lots of progress. Loopholes have been plugged and financial transactions made more open. And the new norm has started yielding the desired target as the state internally generated revenue reached N1 billion before the COVID-19 outbreak. But some people, whose pockets are drying up as a result of the reforms, are unhappy. Sentry learnt that in conjunction with their godfathers, they are plotting to prevent Sule from getting another term in office. “They just cannot imagine another four years without business as usual,” a source said. Will Governor Sule survive the gang-up? Time will tell.
