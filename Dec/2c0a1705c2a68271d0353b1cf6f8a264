A Magistrates’ Court in Asaba, Delta State, has remanded the Chairman of Patani Local Government Council, Perez Omoun, in Ogwashi-Uku Correctional Centre. Omoun was sued by the police on a four-count charge, including intent to cause grievous harm and unlawfully injuring Ebikapade Tuesday, who tried to prevent him from attacking Basil Ganagana and his family. Ganagana is the Commissioner for Energy. Magistrate V. O. Okonta ordered that Omoun be remanded in the Ogwashi-Ukwu correctional facility till December 30 pending the determination of his bail application and the issue of jurisdiction raised by the prosecutor, F. O. Itua. Omoun was also charged for malicious damage of eight cars belonging to Ganagana, his family members and the Ministry of Energy, valued at N199.9 million. He was also charged for maliciously damaging the iron gate of Ganagana’s house  and for attempting to commit suicide. The prosecution prayed the court to remand Omoun in custody since the court lacks the jurisdiction to adjudicate on the suit, a request the court granted after entertaining objections from the defence lawyer and adjourned further hearing till December 30. Omoun allegedly broke into Ganagana’s compound about 3am on December 13, pulled down his gate and vandalised cars parked inside the premises.
