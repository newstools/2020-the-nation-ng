 The Judicial Panel of Enquiry set up to look into Police Brutality and Other Matters in Ondo State has promised to visit individualsâ€™ properties that were destroyed during the #EndSARS protest. Seventeen persons and organisations have filed petitions seeking compensation for the destruction of their properties. Panel Chairman, Justice Adesola Sidiq, gave the assurance when victims of the EndSARS protest began presentations of how they lost valuables. Justice Sidiq said there would be a visit to the site of the destruction to see the damage done for proper recommendations. A former governorship aspirant on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Ife Oyedele, whose house was razed at Okitipupa, said he lost property estimated at N52 million to protest. Oyedele, who was represented by his counsel, Omololu Bagbe, listed the affected property to include his residential apartment in Okitipupa and his political campaign offices in Okitipupa and Akure, the state capital. Further hearing in his petition was halted due to an amendment to the petition as his counsel was directed to submit the documents through the secretary of the panel. The Ondo chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said there was destruction of its secretariat and another property in Akure. Secretary and Legal Adviser of Ondo PDP, Olusola Olujimi, told the panel that part of the destroyed property was being rebuilt. He said a letter detailing the destroyed items had been sent to Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu before the renovation started.
