 PROMISE David (27), on Sunday night, allegedly beat his 18-year-old ‘baby mama’, Esther Pascal, to death. David works for a popular car wash outlet in Yenagoa. The incident happened on Ebis Mechanic Road, Yenagoa, Bayelsa State. The two were said to be fighting over feeding and welfare allowance for their two-year-old baby. Residents said the lovers’ quarrels had been a recurring experience. One of them said Esther’s cry for help woke them about 11.30pm on Sunday. The source said: “By the time few of us got to their door, it was locked from inside. But we forced it open and met the deceased on the floor. “We tried to revive her with water thinking she fainted but we discovered she had died. We immediately apprehended the man and alerted the police.” While few residents claimed the man used a heavy object to hit Esther on the head, others claimed she was given a punch on the head. Representatives of the Gender Response Initiatives (GRI), established by the governor’s wife, Mrs. Gloria Diri, have visited the scene. Deputy Coordinator of GRI Dise Ogbise, a lawyer, described the situation as unfortunate. She called for more advocacies to end domestic violence and violence against the girl-child. Police spokesman Asinim Butswat said the suspect has been arrested and investigation is on.
