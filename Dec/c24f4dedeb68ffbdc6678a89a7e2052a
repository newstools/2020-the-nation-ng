 Super Eagles’ coach Gernot Rohr said the Real Madrid Academy in Port Harcourt can be compared to any of the best academies across the world. This is just as the Special Adviser to Rivers State Governor on Real Madrid Academy, Christopher Green, said the state government remains fully resolute in their quest of making the project the best ever in Africa. “The infrastructures are high level, it’s like in Europe and you can compare with one of the best academies in Europe like they have in Spain; Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia or in France in Paris (PSG) and in Germany in Bayern Munich,”  Rohr stated while being conducted  round the  edifice  facilitated by the administration of Governor Nyesom Wike. In Rohr’s company for the tour were Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) Technical Director Austin Eguavoen and Super Eagles’ Team Secretary Dayo Enebi Achor. “I think they (Real Madrid Academy, Port Harcourt) are ready to start this programme with these wonderful structures and also with the good pitch. It will be very interesting to see what they can do. “I think the Governor has done great work and now they have to select the best players and bring some good players in a few years to the future,” said the 67-year old expatriate coach. Rohr specifically expressed delight in the academic aspect of the Academy. Equally Eguavoen was impressed with the quality of infrastructure put in place at the Treasure Base of the Nation. “I am very impressed. What else can you ask for, for football development? Combining education with football is what we’ve been craving for and what we’ve come here to see today is wonderful, it is excellent and hopefully, we will gain from this in time to come,” he stated.
