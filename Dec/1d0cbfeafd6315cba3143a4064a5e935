 Filmmaker Mildred Okwo is committed to setting up a computer centre from funds made from her films. The brain behind the upcoming film, ‘La Femme Anjola,’ recently reiterated her commitment to setting up the computer centre weeks after the EndSARS protest. She took to her official Twitter handle to express the reason behind her determination to set up the computer center. “A percentage of my profits from my films will be used to build a computer centre in my village. I am even more committed now to ensuring that every young person there receives free basic computer training,” she tweeted. Okwo went further to say social media will be one of the courses that will be studied in the computer centre like this, she believes, will empower the youths to have a proper understanding and knowledge as well as power of the social media. “Social media will be one of the courses,” she added. Okwo doubles as the manager and business partner of Nollywood sterling actress, Rita Dominic. The duo co-own production outfit, Audrey Silver Productions, and have released top films that include The Meeting, Suru Lere, and upcoming film, La Femme Anjola.
