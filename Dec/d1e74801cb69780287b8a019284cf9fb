The club Press Officer, Zazi Samuel Bariza confirmed the news but stressed that all hands are on deck to ensure that Mbaoma is fit and ready for the second leg in Aba next month. Bariza also said that Johnson Umall who deputised for Imoh Obot during the Governor Ikpeazu Pre-season Tournament in Aba is currently down with a groin injury. With Obot out of the game with Al Merreikh game in Omdurman owing to the red card he bagged in the closing stages of the draw with Rahimo, Zazi affirmed that they are happy with the return of Daniel Darkwah another left back who fell ill for quite some-time.
