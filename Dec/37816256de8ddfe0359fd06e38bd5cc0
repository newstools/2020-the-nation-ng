 More trouble could be on the way for former Senate President Bukola Saraki, former Kwara State Governor, Abdulfatah Ahmed, as well as some of their associates. They may all have to answer to questions regarding the alleged sale and acquisition of some government assets. Sources told Sentry that while Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq may not be too keen to push the questioning of Saraki and company, some top shots of the ruling APC are impressing on him the need to cause the former men of power to explain their involvement in the “secret sale of state assets at giveaway prices.” Presenting a three-volume report to AbdulRazaq on Wednesday in Ilorin, Chairman of the Kwara State Assets Commission of Enquiries, Justice Olabanji Orilonishe (rtd), said discoveries during their assignment showed that the state was milked “to complete hopelessness and a standstill amidst avenues for reckless expenditure to enrich some individuals.” And if tales emanating from some concerned quarters in the state are anything to go by, Saraki and some of his friends may once again be called upon to shed light on certain policies and decisions they took while at the helm of affairs – especially with regards to the sale of some government assets within and outside the state.
