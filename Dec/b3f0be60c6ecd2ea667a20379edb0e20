There was pandemonium in Ohorhe community, Uvwie council area of Delta state, Tuesday, as two teachers were reportedly kidnapped by armed men dressed in military uniform in Ohorhe Secondary School. The suspected kidnappers were reported to have gained entrance into the school’s premises in a gold-coloured Highlander SUV. The victims are identified as Mses. Gladys Niemogha and Blessing Emunefe. It was gathered that they hovered in the school compound for over 15 minutes, before storming into one of the staff rooms and abducted the teachers. The school management, on seeing the military uniform, had assumed that the gunmen were military personnel. According to reports, the hoodlums were a gang of four. But only three stepped out to carry out the plan, wielding sophisticated guns. The Nation further learnt that the hoodlums had tried to take a third victim, but she managed to escape their hold. Recounting the ordeal, a source in the community said the gunmen threatened to shoot at the community youths who tried to confront them on getting wind of the incident. A source in the school said, “the gunmen were dressed in military uniform. They were four in the Jeep including the driver. They were there for about 15 minutes. “They threatened to kill us if any of us shout. Teachers and students were afraid of being killed. They were armed with good guns.” The Delta State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Onome Onovwakpoyeya, confirmed the incident to The Nation, stating that “two teachers were abducted.”
