The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Anambra State has banned members of the State Executive Council (SEC) from campaigning for any governorship aspirant ahead of the 2021 election. Chairman Ndubuisi Nwobu gave the directive on Wednesday when a governorship aspirant, Wilson Udeh, visited the secretariat. Nwobu said the directive affects party officials from state to ward levels. He urged them to maintain neutrality, saying defaulters would be sanctioned. According to the chairman, experiences have shown that supporting individual aspirants has been the party’s bane in winning elections. He reiterated that any official who attaches himself to a particular aspirant will be sanctioned. He said: “It’s our resolve that party officials should remain neutral until after the primaries when all of us shall support one candidate. By so doing, we shall not be factionalised before the main election. “Experience has taught us that if we attach ourselves to individual aspirants, and then our choice aspirant fails in the primaries, we will abandon the general cause. That should stop.” Udeh promised to support the party’s candidate even if he loses in the primaries. “I have not come to promise to build 21 universities but if elected governor in 2021, ugly faces in this state will be made beautiful and happy”.
