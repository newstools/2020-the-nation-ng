Nineteen persons have died of Lassa fever between January and November 2020 in Toro and Tafawa Balewa local government areas of Bauchi State. Executive Chairman of the State Primary Health Care Development Agency (BASPHCDA), Dr. Rilwanu Mohammed, announced this on Wednesday in Bauchi while giving an update on Lassa and yellow fever outbreaks in the state. Dr. Mohammed also said the state had received 4 million doses of yellow fever vaccine from the Federal Government, adding that vaccination will be administered in January 2021 with the target population of ages one to 44, said to be vulnerable. The BASPHCDA chairman explained that efforts were being made to ensure that the yellow fever outbreak did not spread to other local government areas as well as neighbouring states of Kano and Jigawa. He also said the vaccination for yellow fever will be conducted in 19 local government areas in the state with the exception of Alkaleri, which had its vaccination in 2019 due to the outbreak there. Mohammed regretted the apathy among the people, saying many residents refused to be vaccinated, despite the education and enlightenment programmes the agency had carried out on the issue.
