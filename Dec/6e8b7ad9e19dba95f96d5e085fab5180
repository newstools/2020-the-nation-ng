In what appears like a playback of the recent youth uprising, #EndSARS protest, residents of Ajaganabe Square and the adjoining Apena/Oloye Street, Epe, Lagos State did not allow INEC ad-hoc officials to set up their equipment and do their job. Their reason is that they were not given some money by the various political parties like in the past. A group of middle-aged women who spoke to our reporter summarised the situation this way: “We did not allow them to sit down and do their job because we have not been settled. It is not just the boys that drove them away; the entire community rose in unison and sent them away.” The women who spoke in Yoruba added: “Kosi owo, kosi ibo (no money, no voting). Once they have been voted in, you cannot approach them any longer and they will not cater for the interests of the people. There is no job for the people and things are getting more difficult for us.” At about 12.30pm, after the police were called in to provide security, the voting process eventually began at Apena/Oloye Street. But the same thing cannot be said for Ajaganabe Square because the electoral officials were nowhere in sight.
