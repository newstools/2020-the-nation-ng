Premier League club Chelsea have made the second instalment payment of subsequent transfer fee as concerns Kenneth Omeruo to Sunshine Stars, who have now admitted they wrongly paid an agent, who is a third party. Jobisports Academy have maintained they ought to be the party to be paid, but instead a Lagos-based agent, who was a third party in Omeruoâ€™s transfer, has been the one who has benefited from this subsequent transfer. It was gathered that the agent, who was backed by a former chief executive of Sunshine Stars, stormed Akure with a platoon of policemen to ensure he was paid by the NPFL outfit. However, Sunshine Stars officials have now admitted their blunder and have assured Jobisports they will now be the party to benefit from the subsequent transfer. CD Leganes defender Omeruo has also disowned the so-called agent, insisting he was transferred to Sunshine Stars by Jobisports. Jobisports Academy have threatened to drag Sunshine Stars to FIFA court over the payment to the agent, who is a third party.
