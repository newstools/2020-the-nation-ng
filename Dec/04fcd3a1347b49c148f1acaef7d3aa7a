A Federal High Court in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, has sentenced a Swedish-Nigerian woman, Stephany Isaksson (43), to four years imprisonment for child kidnapping. Justice Fatun Riman jailed Isaksson on a two count charge of receiving an 18 months’ baby fraudulently from one Uduak, at large, for exploitation. Isaksson, who hails from Mbiayon, Uruan Local Government Area, was allegedly arrested at the Swedish Embassy when she went to get papers for the child. She was handed over to the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) in 2018. Justice Riman sentenced Isaksson to two years or a fine of N250,000 (for count one) and two years or pay a fine of N250,000 (for count two). The sentences will run concurrently while the fine is accumulative.
