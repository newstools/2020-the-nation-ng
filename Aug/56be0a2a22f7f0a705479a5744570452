Nigerian defender  Musa Muhammed  said he was pleased   with HNK Gorica’s   winning start  of the  season following his  side’s  5-1 away win against NK Varazdin as the 2020/21 Croatian First Football League gets underway over the weekend. HNK missed out of the honours last season  when they finished sixth  on the table  but the  2013 FIFA U-17 World cup winning captain  with the Golden Eaglets said they are ready to take up  the gauntlet  this time around. “ It was  an important victory  for us because this is  our first match of the season,” the 23-year-old  told NationSport. “ We have to look forward to the next matches and to keep winning our matches.” In continuation of the  series, HNK  will yet again be away to Slaven Belupo come Saturday and Muhammed who also captained the Flying Eagles to win the U-20 AFCON in 2015 is hopefully of another positive result. “Everybody  was  happy that we won our first game  and I’m also very happy because I played  throughout the match; no we  have to keep  our focus ahead of the  next game.” The former Istanbul Basaksehir defender said   he and  teammates have to brace up for the challenges ahead since matches are to be played  behind closed doors sans spectators as part of COVId-19 protocols. “ Of course, it is always amazing  but now we (players) have to give ourselves extra motivation as a team,” added Muhammed.
