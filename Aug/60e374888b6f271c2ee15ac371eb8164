Popular youth politician and entrepreneur Runsewe Opeoluwa has said the next crop of leaders in 2023 at State and Federal levels should be successful entrepreneurs. Opeoluwa, who spoke with The Nation on phone, argued Nigeria needs experienced and successful business managers capable of deploying managerial and investment strategies to positively turn around the economy. “So many people in elective positions are solely dependent on internal revenue and federal allocations, It’s high time we learned to reach beyond these; rather, we ought to opt for too-notch research and development required to make informed decision towards the appropriate strategic investment and capital projects required to propel social prosperity in the country. “I usually refrain from commenting on the next general elections and my other ambitions in the nearest future but I’m an ardent believer that there has never been a better time for successful entrepreneurs and public servants to take up the responsibly of leadership in governance. “I have been inundated by calls from my friends and followers about my next political aspiration, while it is still too early to give definite answers, I want to assure us all that I will address these concerns in due time. “I am currently focused on my role in public service, the development of my ventures and the empowerment initiatives currently being executed by OJAR foundation; all aimed towards ensuring social prosperity and the attainment of sustainable development in Nigeria”, he said.
