Mrs. Florence Ajimobi, wife of the late governor of Oyo State, Abiola Ajimobi, has said her late husband came, saw and conquered. She added that he is resting in peace in heaven having finished his course here on earth. Mrs. Ajimobi spoke at her Oluyole, Ibadan home when the Chairman of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Oyo State Council, Ademola Babalola and other leaders visited her on the occasion of Eid-el-Kabir. She said she cried over her husband because she missed him, adding that he died a fulfilled man. Mrs. Ajimobi said: “I’m crying because I miss him. I miss everything about him. I miss his love, advice, having him around me, he was my strength. He was my greatest supporter. He thinks I’m a strong woman, but this time, I tell you I am not a strong woman. He used to give me all the strength I needed as a woman. So,  when I cry, it is not because he did not achieve much, but because I miss so much about him. I don’t want to behave like an unbeliever because I know nothing happens without God’s input. We are all here one day and we are all going back one day. Nobody knows when death is going to come. I believe so much in destiny and I believe my husband’s time was up. “He lived a fulfilled life. What does it profit a man even if he lived up to 90 years and he can’t make heaven? Abiola Ajimobi made heaven and he is at peace with God. That is my greatest consolation. That is my joy. I cried and was sad because I miss him. “For those of you that are here today, I say thank you from the depth of my heart. On behalf of my children and the entire family, I say thank you. What we are doing here today is to prove to the world that he lives on. My husband is not physically here, but I know his spirit lives on. This is because to live in the heart of people you love means you live forever. His legacies will continue to be upheld, God helping us, everything he has achieved in Oyo State and Nigeria by extension will forever live on.“
