If Nigeria does not kill Corruption
Corruption will kill Nigeria There is a new trick in our land of rogues: Steal and steal till you drain the  till And if called to account – a rare, rare event- Don your mask for the drama of deceit  Lawmaker, Professor, Doctor, Imam, or Pastor None can resist the lure of lucre Crazy crisp notes and their tempting treat And Ghana-must-go’s bursting at the seams  One hundred billion naira as COVID ‘palliatives’ Half drops heavy in the Manager’s account And ravenous Board Members with their brains in their guts Are fighting deadly Corona with their viral vices  Stolen, those billions reserved for our devastated Delta After bouts and  bouts of death and dearth Of oil-scorched earth and viscous rivers The imperiled people and their oily tears*  The Minister points one finger at the Manager’s pocket But the other fingers are trained at the Minister’s loot And we the people are dazed with culpable dread Un-talking, un-acting as the drama unfolds  The Manager faints and plays for dead When faced with the theft of our precious billions A versatile Professor, without a doubt And Doctor of the art of Steal and Faint  *Title of Ibiwari Ikiriko’s book of poems.
