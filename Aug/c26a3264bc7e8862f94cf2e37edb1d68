 THE new council chairmen have unveiled plans to win their area for the All Progressives Congress (APC) standard-bearer, Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu. This followed the governorâ€™s charge to them during their swearing-in on Monday that they should ensure his victory at the polls on October 10. Akeredolu had told the council bosses that his victory in the election would ensure their stay in office for the next three years. The Chairman of Akoko North West, Ayodele Samson, said he would settle down to work immediately despite the short period before the election. Ayodele, in a chat with reporters, said he would begin grading of rural roads as well as provide empowerment materials to boost food production. He said he knew the workings of the locality and as such it would be easy for him to succeed. The Chairman of Eseodo Council, Ms Folawole Sibasi, said she would begin mass mobilisation of women by holding meetings with them before the election. She said her women empowerment programme had already endeared her to women in the locality. Sibasi said more efforts would be put in place to uplift the lives of children in riverine communities.
