A board member of the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN), Rosa Collins said the 2017 constitution of the federation remains the working document guiding the activities of its officials and stakeholders. Collins, a former African triple jump record holder said  the clarification becomes necessary following reports that the constitution was amended at the AFN Congress in Awka last December. “Eng. Ibrahim Gusau wrote in a letter dated August 7, and addressed to chairmen of state associations that the AFN constitution was amended in Awka and that it is that amended constitution that is now the working document of the federation. This is far from the truth.” said Collins.  “To start with, there was no AFN Congress in Awka. The AFN constitution (2017) is clear on how a Congress can be convened and the charade in Awka did not comply with article 6.1.4 of the federation’s constitution which stipulates a 60-day notice must be given before a congress can be convened,” said the 1995 African Games champion. The AFN board member is bewildered by Gusau’s penchant for circumventing the constitution to achieve personal goals. ”Perhaps Eng. Gusau has forgotten that the AFN is governed by its constitution and no one, not even its President and/or the Secretary General can, at their whims and caprices effect any change without following the procedure laid out in the constitution,” she fumed.
