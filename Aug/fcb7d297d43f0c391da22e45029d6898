Usain Bolt has tested positive for coronavirus just days after partying with guests, including England star Raheem Sterling for his 34th birthday in Jamaica, according to Nationwide90fm, a radio station in Jamaica. The greatest sprinter will spend time in self-isolation as a result. Bolt was honoured with a surprise birthday party on August 21 which was attended by a host of big names. Manchester City star Sterling, Bayer Leverkusen attacker Leon Bailey, and cricket legend Chris Gayle attended. Footage from the party showed Bolt laughing and dancing with his guests and even taking the microphone while speakers blared out an Adele song at the outdoor bash. The guests also danced to the song Lockdown which was produced by Jamaican reggae singer Koffee in reference to the pandemic. Eight-time Olympic gold medallist Bolt hailed it as the ‘best birthday ever’ in an Instagram post featuring a sweet picture of Bolt and his baby daughter Olympia. It is not clear whether Bolt is suffering any symptoms of the disease but local media said he would ‘proceed into isolation’. Bolt would be one of the most prominent sportsmen in the world to contract the coronavirus after tennis star Novak Djokovic tested positive in June and American major sports leagues were disrupted by bouts of the disease. Jamaica has recorded a total of 1,413 cases of coronavirus and 16 deaths from the disease, with infections soaring in recent days. After recording just 174 cases throughout the whole of July, Jamaica has seen 267 infections in just the last four days. The Caribbean nation avoided going into the kind of widespread lockdown seen in Europe at the height of the pandemic but did shut borders to foreign arrivals in May. (daily mail)
