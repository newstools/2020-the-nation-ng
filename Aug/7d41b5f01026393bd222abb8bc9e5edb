A Nigeria born gospel artiste based in the Republic of Ireland, Liz Dayspring, is planning big for the celebration of her 10th anniversary on stage. After a decade of churning out gospel songs as an artist, songwriter and vocalist, she aims to collaborate with her role models and leading gospel artistes, Tope Alabi and Sinach. Speaking on her 10th anniversary, Liz Dayspring said she would have loved to celebrate in a bigger way, to appreciate God and the people that have supported her over the years, but because of the coronavirus ravaging the world, the celebration will be on a low key. To this end, the singer plans to release a single from her forthcoming third album in the coming weeks. With two albums and over 30 songs to her credit, Daysprings says her love for music started at a tender young age. “I started in the Sunday school at The Apostolic Church, my parents (Overseer/Deaconess M. O Anjorin) they both loved music too, my father was a choirmaster at the church for years & my mother a soprano singer. But my love for gospel music started in my teenage years. I was a member of a gospel group called Singspiration in my early days, where my fondness and interest for gospel music developed. Since then my love for gospel music grew,” she submitted. Dayspring says she draws inspiration from the word of God, situations, and challenges in her life as a follower of Christ.
