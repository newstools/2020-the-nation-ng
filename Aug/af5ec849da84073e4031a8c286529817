Founder of the Synagogue Church Of All Nations (SCOAN) Prophet TB Joshua has reacted  to Lagos State Government’s decision to lift ban on religious gatherings from this weekend. Joshua said he would reopen SCOAN services after hearing from God. The Federal Government placed a ban on religious gatherings last March to limit the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. It relaxed the ban on June 2 but granted states discretion for local implemention of the order. Lagos State, the epicentre of the virus in Nigeria with 15,355 of the country’s 44,433 confirmed cases, deferred the ban relaxation. Speaking via SCOAN’s Emmanuel TV, the preacher commended Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s decision to reopen places of worship. He assured his followers as soon as God speaks, he would let them know when physical services will resume. “Good morning and win today! Following the announcement that church services will resume in Lagos on August 9th, 2020 – that is, this coming Sunday – I wish to commend the authorities for their efforts so far. “However, having heard from the authorities, we are now waiting to hear from God. “Please be assured that as soon as we hear from God, we will inform you when our services will resume. Emmanuel – God is with us,” he said.
