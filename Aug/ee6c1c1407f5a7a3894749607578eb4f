 A FEDERAL High Court in Lagos has remanded a businessman, Ibegbu Anayo, for allegedly producing and distributing adulterated engine lubricants. The Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) arraigned him before Justice Rilwan Aikawa on a 12-count charge of producing substandard oil and rebranding them. The judge ordered his remand in police custody pending the hearing of his bail application. SON said Anayo and others now at large, on July 15, at Mammy Market, Navy Town, Ojo, “did indulge in the production of adulterated/substandard Total and Mobil engine oil lubricants for public consumption”. The agency alleged that Anayo affixed false labels on kegs of various sizes and unbranded cartons and claimed they were genuine Total and Mobil engine oil, which was “calculated to deceive unsuspecting consumers that the products are genuine Total or Mobil products”. The products, SON said, did not comply with the mandatory industrial standards for lubricants, an offence punishable under Section 26(2) of the SON Act, 2015. The defendant pleaded not guilty to all the counts. Justice Rilwan Aikawa ordered that he be remanded in police custody, and adjourned until tomorrow for hearing.
