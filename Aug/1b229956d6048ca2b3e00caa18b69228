Napoli’s record signing Victor Osimhen has admitted he was worried about racism incidents in Italian football before his mega-deal to the Serie A club but the Nigeria international believes with the backing of the Azzurri’s fans he would be able to succeed in Italy. Initial reports claimed Osimhen was hesitant to sign for Gennaro Gattuso’s side but  speaking at the club’s first press conference since their arrival at  Castel di Sangro pre-season camp, the Super Eagles forward   said he was convinced after visiting Naples. He said: “There was a bit of skepticism on my part, because it is a question that belongs to the whole world. Then I visited the city of Naples, saw the environment with my own eyes and realized that I am in a wonderful city. “ The issue of racism is a problem that exists everywhere but I’m sure I have chosen well because the Neapolitans will make me feel at home with their affection.” Osimhen also talked about his relationship with club president Aurelio De Laurentiis and his manager Gattuso: “The President and the coach wanted me strongly; they talked to me a lot even before coming here. For me they were both like a father because they gave me so much advice. “I decided to accept the challenge against Napoli right after speaking with them. It is difficult to receive all the love they have shown me. For a young player like me, having this affection is essential.”
