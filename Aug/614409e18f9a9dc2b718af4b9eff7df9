The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Port Harcourt’s Zonal office, has dragged one Kingsley Odum to the Federal High Court sitting in Port Harcourt for alleged N18m land scam. Odum was brought before Justice I. M Sani on one count of obtaining money by false pretence contrary to Section 1(1) (a) of the Advance Fee Fraud and Other Related Offences Act 2006. Odum’s trouble was said to have started when the commission received a petition from a complainant alleging that he sold a parcel of land situated at Rumuchiolu in Eneka town, Obi/Akpor Local Government Area of Rivers State, to her in 2016. Investigation showed that the victim paid the defendant over N18m and sent workers to commence work on the land-only to realise later that the land was not owned by the defendant. When the charge was read to him on Friday, Odum pleaded “not guilty” compelling the prosecuting Lawyer, N. A. Dodo to seek a short adjournment for the commencement of trial. But the Lawyer to the defendant, E.C Obasy, informed the court of a pending application for the bail of the defendant which was not opposed by the prosecution. Sani granted the defendant bail of N5million and one surety in like sum, who must show proof of ownership of landed property in Port Harcourt and deposit two recent passport photographs with the court. The defendant was remanded in prosecution’s custody pending the perfection of his bail terms while the matter was adjourned till September 2, 2020, for trial.
