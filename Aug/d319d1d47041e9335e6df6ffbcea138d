 A budding artist, YGB, has made known his desire to be signed to an equally fast rising record label, Blacksheep Entertainment. YGB made his intention known saying his thirst to be signed by Blacksheep Entertainment is necessitated by the achievements of the label. Blacksheep Entertainment is popular for the collaboration with DJ Valentine Ejimbe that produced the now familiar Wet, Wild, Wasted series of a late-night party. The innovation had in its early days attracted talents like Fireboy and Oxlade before becoming global brands. The management of Blacksheep Entertainment has kept mum on YGBâ€™s comment.
