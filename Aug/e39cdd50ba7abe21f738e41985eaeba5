 PLATEAU State Chairman on Federal Government Public Works Selection Committee Rufus Bature has stated that the committee is set to embark on a tour of the 17 councils  to identify and recruit artisan youths into the Federal Government Public Works jobs. Bature said 17,000 itinerant unskilled workers will be recruited at 1000 each per local government area in line with Federal Government’s desire to engage 1000 from each of the 774 local government areas. Bature, who spoke to reporters at the old Government House Rayfield in Jos, said that the ongoing recruitment of artisans for Public works jobs will be transparent. “We shall be embarking on a working visit to all the councils of Plateau State from this week to sensitise the general public on this laudable programme that President Buhari has introduced. “The tour will also enable us to identify and recruit the participants and to also identify projects in each council. We shall distribute to be filled by recruits, these forms are free and should not be sold as indicated on the form.” He said all state wards have been allocated at least 50 slots depending on the number in the council. “We believe that at least 3 people from each of the polling units will be beneficiaries of this programme.
