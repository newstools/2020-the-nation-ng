The International Press Centre (IPC) in Lagos will conduct a one-day webinar/virtual capacity building session for journalists ahead of the Ondo and Edo states’ governorship elections. The webinar, organised under component 4b: support to media of the European Union Support to Democratic Governance in Nigeria (EU-SDGN) project, aims to engage and build the capacity of select journalists and media stakeholders in Ondo and Edo states. IPC’s Executive Director Lanre Arogundade said the media capacity building session is aimed at consolidating efforts by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and other electoral stakeholders, under the EU-SDGN project, to ensure that the media coverage of both elections is handled professionally. The webinar, which will feature key stakeholders’ representatives from INEC and other institutions, will include special capacity building sessions by media experts who will facilitate themes for professional and ethical reportage of the elections, including issues of inclusivity, fact-checking, hate speech and conflict-sensitive reporting (online/offline).
