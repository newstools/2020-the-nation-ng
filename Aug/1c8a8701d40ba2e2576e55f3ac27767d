A firm, Prudential Zenith Life Insurance, has donated $100,000 (N38 million) to Slum2school Africa to help cushion the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on education in disadvantaged communities across Nigeria. Its managing director and chief executive officer, Mr. Chuks Igumbor, stated this on Tuesday in a statement in Lagos. Igumbor, while presenting the cheque to the organisation, said the donation was from the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) fund of Prudence Foundation, the community arm of Prudential Plc in Asia and Africa. “Our contribution to Slum2School’s activities demonstrates our corporate social responsibility action plan, which is targetted toward communities most in need of the support we provide. “The coronavirus pandemic has impacted all aspects of our lives, including the education sector, with a steep widening of education inequality. “Children and youths from underprivileged communities are unable to access the learning materials that students from affluent backgrounds are able to access” “The strategic partnership between Prudential Zenith Life and Slum2School, therefore, aims to bridge this gap and engage learners from Nursery to Senior Secondary School across 20 slums and communities in Lagos State. “The $100,000 donation will be used to procure 300 tablets with internet connections; 34 laptops for Slum2School facilitators; 34 whiteboards, markers and board eraser sets; state-of-the-art learning studio for 50-90 pupils per session; stationery for students, as well as learning programmes and software,” he said. Igumbor noted that cash donation and relief foodstuffs would also be provided to the less-privileged families within the identified communities to assist in the trying times.
