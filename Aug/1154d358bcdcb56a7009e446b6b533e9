 AXA Mansard Health Limited has unveiled initiatives to better its customers amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Head of Preventive Health and Wellness of the company, Dr Edeigbini Omokhudu has said. In a statement, he said the initiatives cut across drug pickups, health talks and webinar series for the corporate customers. According to him, with over 75 pharmacies partners across Nigeria, the AXA Mansard Health initiative is aimed at making medication accessible to the enrolees and limit exposure to the  virus. He stated that enrolees with chronic illnesses could pick up their medications monthly from the pharmacy instead of going to the hospitals for refills.  He said: “After talking to a doctor on our telemedicine app, they can also pick up medications prescribed; the enrolee can walk into any of our partners with a prescription and enrolee card to be attended to. ‘’The company went virtual on their series and health talks with topics springing from mental wellness, COVID-19, sedentary lifestyle, hypertension, and hepatitis being slated for later this week. “With 99 per cent engagement with our customers, these topics were uniquely selected based on: data from the claims pool per organisation where we suggest what topics will be most pertinent to their staff, their choice based on their own internal processes where we offer them a list of topics from the pool and then they pick based on their own decision making process,” he added.
