 ONDO State Police Command has said its officers and men will remain apolitical, impartial and discharge their duties professionally during and after the October 10 governorship election. It said it was prepared for the poll. Police Commissioner Salami Bolaji spoke at the weekend when he received a delegation of YIAGA Africa Initiative, who visited him to ascertain the level of police preparedness for the election. He said any politician plotting to re-enact the 1983 episode of political violence in the state must be ready to bear the burden of his action. Bolaji said contrary to insinuations that the command might not be prepared due to the impact of COVID-19, his men were prepared to provide security for the parties participating in the election, their followers as well as other participants in the electoral assignment. He said: “Even if it is now, we are ready as we have the required logistics and manpower set for the exercise. “The command is ready to work with the relevant bodies to ensure the success of the election. We are ready to provide security for the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) officials and their materials, to ensure nothing untoward happens during and after the election.’’ Ms. Cynthia Mbamalu, who spoke on behalf of YIAGA Africa, said they came to discuss the role the police would play to ensure a violence-free governorship election. Said she: “YIAGA’s role as an observer group, among other functions, is to see that the police maintain an impartial stance with stakeholders, to achieve a hitch-free, fair and credible governorship election in October.”
