She said in her husband’s manifesto, the SIMPLE agenda, there was provision to empower and support women with investments in their businesses and protect them against abuse. Mrs. Ize-Iyamu spoke at a campaign at Uzebba in Owan West Local Government. With her were APC women leaders, including the wife of the deputy governorship candidate, Hajia Nana Audu, and the party’s state Women Leader, Mrs. Betty Okoebor. They met people from Owan West, Owan East and Akoko-Edo local governments, who declared support for the APC and promised to vote for the party on September 19. Prof. Ize-Iyamu said her husband planned to expand women’s trade and businesses, as well as improve security, especially in rural communities. She said he intended to care for the elderly if voted into power. Mrs. Ize-Iyamu said: “We are here to tell you that our governorship candidate, Pastor Ize-Iyamu, will boost your businesses, create jobs for your children and take care of your welfare. “He will also support your farming and ensure your markets have water and toilet facilities.” She said being a doctor; she would assist her husband to revamp the health sector. “Most of our hospitals lack doctors, nurses and drugs. I will use my experience to ensure that these are provided in government hospitals. “I will ensure that the elderly and children with special needs get access to free medical services.” The wife of the APC governorship candidate said her husband would address infrastructure decay, especially in the education sector, to improve learning and ensure that children, including those in rural communities, access quality education in a conducive environment. Voter education was conducted at the rally, as the women were shown the right way to cast their votes, particularly for the APC.
