The maiden Ogbomosho 10km road race will now hold on Saturday November 28,2020,according to organisers of the race. The first road race to be held in the ancient city was originally scheduled to hold last May but  was  shifted due to COVID-19 enforced  nationwide lockdown. Chairman of the organising committee Prince Oyebamiji Aderemi revealed  that the race has the backing of the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN): “We have written to the AFN communicating the new date and have been assured of the necessary technical support by the  governing body for athletics in Nigeria.” Oyebamiji is delighted with the response his committee is getting from people in and around Ogbomosho who are happy the city  is hosting a major road race event in Nigeria.  “We are delighted the Honourable Minister of Sports,  Mr. Sunday Dare has demonstrated his commitment and dedication towards the actualisation of the race. His unwavering support has propelled the committee towards staging the maiden edition of the 10km road race which will serve as the benchmark for subsequent editions,” he said. The race to be held within Ogbomosho   is expected to  be flagged off at Oja Akande and ends at the Soun Ogunlola Stadium.
