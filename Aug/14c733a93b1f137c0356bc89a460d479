Lucy has said she knew from onset that being paired with Kiddwaya for the Pepsi Turnup challenge wouldn’t end well. She said this during her diary session on Friday, August 28. The former Head of House said she got nervous and forgot her lyrics. “I was so mad at myself how I forgot the simple lyrics and I was so mad at the fact that I got Kidd as my partner. I was just furious at myself that’s how I just lost the whole thing,” she said.
