The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has denied allegations it is planning to rig the September 19 Edo Governorship election. The People’s Democratic Party (PDP), it stated, resorted to what it described as “childish and comical conspiracies” because it is rattled by rising profile and widespread acceptance of its candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu. Reacting to allegations APC has obtained extra INEC result sheets to rig Edo poll, APC Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Yekini Nabena, said PDP outburst was a product of a camp gripped by fear of imminent defeat. The governing party further said the PDP was accusing APC of election fraud, which “is the PDP’s stock-in-trade.” The statement reads: “Sensing the widespread acceptance and support the good people of Edo State have given the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu in the lead up to the forthcoming governorship election, the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) is clearly panicked and has resorted to childish and comical conspiracies. “Procurement of result sheets, cloning of PVCs, stealing card readers, vote buying, voter intimidation and other election fraud is the PDP’s stock-in-trade. For us in the APC, it is one person, one vote. “Our people-focused development records are visible to all and the good people of Edo state are poised to make the right and progressive choice, come September 19.” The party appealed to security agencies to stop the PDP’s plan of unleashing violence, intimidation of voters and vote buying during the election. “Come September 19, votes will count and the will of the Edo electorate will prevail,” it said.
