Music producer, Larry Gaga, has been tasked with the challenge of working with new music acts to recreate some of Nigeria’s old tunes released under Premier Records. The new challenge is coming under Charles Okpaleke owned Playnetwork Africa, which just signed a collaboration deal with Premier Records. Okpaleke, the Chief Executive Officer of Playnetwork Africa, expressed that the need to protect the nostalgic old songs prompted his company to sign the collaboration deal with Larry Gaga as the head honcho for the remake of the song. “The need to protect and bring back nostalgic music has been of importance to us. We have decided to help recreate and bring back good old memories with a touch of modernity in today’s world. We are working with one of Nigeria’s finest producers Larry Gaaga to produce all the works from Premier Records stable. We are excited to embark on this project knowing that we would have succeeded in bridging the gap between the old and the new vibes. ‘A list-artistes’ will be on board to bring spice and life into old works”. Speaking on the collaboration, the General Manager of Premier Records, Michael Odiong posited that projects like this will help preserve Nigeria’s vintage catalogs and open a lot of opportunities for young artists to sample old beats and sounds. Okpaleke also revealed that the project is expected to start rolling out before the end of the year.
