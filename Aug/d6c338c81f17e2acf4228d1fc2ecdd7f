One person has been reported killed in a suspected cult clash in Inen community, OrukAnam council area of Akwa Ibom State. The incident, The Nation learnt, took place on Sunday, prompting church members to scamper for safety. On Saturday when Inen community leaders gathered at the clan council hall to pray for Godâ€™s intervention in cult-related killings in the area, cultists invaded Ikot Obio Idang village, killing one person and beating up others. The cultists regrouped the following Sunday morning and waylaid residents of Ikot Obio Idang village and beat up a retail shop trader, seizing all her wares. An eyewitness, Udo Akanimoh, told our correspondent that Qua Iboe and The Apostolic Church worshippers close to the scene of the incident were forced to dismiss as the hoodlums went berserk manhandling anybody found in the area. Police spokesman said Nnunan Frederick said the command had not received any report of the incident.
