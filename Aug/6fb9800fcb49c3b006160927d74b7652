The Chairman of Academic Staff Union of University (ASUU) UNILAG chapter Dr Dele Ashiru has stated calm has been restored to the institution with the emergence of Prof. Folasade Ogunsola as new Ag.VC. Speaking to reporters in front of the main auditorium, Ashiru stated they were waiting for the Visitation Panel to start work while hoping parties concerned will get justice. Ashiru decried the locking of the University Auditorium before the meeting of the Senate. “The locking of the auditorium is a crudity that has characterised Dr Wale Balabakin’s reign . “No principal of the University should have the temerity to trample on the Senate of the University as we witnessed earlier this morning by the University Registrar,” he said. On whether punishment will be meted out to the Registrar, Mr Azeez Oladejo, he said it was premature to sanction him adding the union stands for due process and when a case is established against him, he would be duly sanctioned for such act.
