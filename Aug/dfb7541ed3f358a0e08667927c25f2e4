At least one person has been reportedly killed in a suspected cult clash in Inen community, OrukAnam local area of Akwa Ibom State. The incident, the Nation learnt, took place on Sunday prompting church members to scamper for safety with many sustaining injuries. It was gathered that trouble started on Saturday afternoon when Inen community leaders gathered at the clan council hall for a solemn Assembly praying for God to intervene in series of cult related killings that had rocked the area in recent times. Our Correspondent gathered that while the prayer session was in progress the cultists invaded Ikot Obio Idang village and killed one person simply identified as ‘Ufot’ and beat others causing the village clan council members to run away for safety. It was also gathered that the suspected cultists regrouped the following Sunday morning and waylaid residents of Ikot Obio Idang village as they beat a retail shop trader seized all her wares and left unconscious in the pool of her blood. An eyewitness Udo Akanimoh told our Correspondent that Qua Iboe and The Apostolic Churches worshippers closed to the scene of the incident were forced to dismiss as the hoodlums went berserk manhandling anybody found around the area. “The boys returned to the village on Sunday morning after killing Ufot and beat a retail shop dealer carting away her goods while two churches namely Qua Iboe Church and Apostolic church members ran away from the church.” “Till now residents of the community have not returned home and we are afraid of staying here. Our women and children have run away to neighboring villages.” In a telephone interview, the Akwa Ibom State Police Public Relations Officer CSP Nnunan Frederick said the state police headquarters have not received any report of the incident but promised to contact the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) of the area. “I only work in the metropolis. I have not received the report yet from the DPO of OrukAnam,” he said.
