 MUSLIMS in Ekiti State have signified their readiness to reopen mosques in the state for services today, after four months of closure, following the coronavirus pandemic. This was part of the resolution reached by the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA), Ekiti State chapter, after a stakeholders meeting organised in collaboration with League of Imams and Alfas in South-West, Edo and Delta, led by its President-General, Alhaji Jamiu Bello. Governor Kayode Fayemi, had on August 6 declared that from all indications, churches and mosques in Ekiti have substantially complied with provision of some COVID-19 precautionary facilities. He said they are allowed to begin operations from today. In a statement in Ado-Ekiti by its President, Ekiti chapter, Alhaji Yakubu Sanni, the state NSCIA directed only the mosques that have met the conditions, which including fumigation of premises, provision of infra-red thermometer, sanitisers, handwashing facilities and strict compliance to reopen for service. The  Christians  Association of Nigeria (CAN) has, however, expressed displeasure over stringent conditions spelt out for the reopening of the worshiping centres. Speaking with reporters in Ado-Ekiti,  CAN Chairman, Rev. Fr. Peter Olowolafe, said the debarring of people below ages 12 and those above 65 from coming to church was too strict a condition that can guarantee smooth take-off of churches.
