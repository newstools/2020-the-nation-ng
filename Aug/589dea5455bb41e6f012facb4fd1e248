   Nollywood filmmaker, Mildred Okwo has opened up on how she films a sensitive or sex scene to make it appealing in movies. In a chat with Molara Woods on her Podcast, Art for the People, Okwo explained that every time she had to shoot such sensitive scenes, she ensures the parties involved get comfortable enough to act professionally. “For me, every time I have to shoot one of those scenes (a sex scene in a movie), everybody is gone on set except the personnel needed to shoot the scene. I go out of my way to make sure that the actors are comfortable to portray what it is to portray and also I ensure that nobody takes advantage of the other because it is difficult for the guy and it’s also difficult for the woman, so it’s my duty to make everywhere comfortable so that they can portray everything they have to portray. As you were asking me how do I do it, I, first of all, empty the place, and only the people that can be there can be there. I know that some crew members can be okay but sometimes, it might make the actors uncomfortable. It’s just another scene in the movie but it’s a serious scene and I make sure my actors are not uncomfortable and I think that is why they are willing to do it for me in my films as well.” Speaking further, the director and co-producer of the award-winning film, ‘The Meeting’ said, “This is actually not my first time, even my first film, there was a bit of nudity in it. So, this film, (La Femme Anjola) it calls for it because I felt if people see it, it would look unreal. What I am trying to say is that there are some certain things that were said in the film and I’m saying there is no way you can portray it that people will believe you. There’s a certain way you have to portray it for people to believe you. And it’s tastefully done, it is not gratuitous.” Okwo is the director of highly anticipated action-packed drama, ‘La Femme Anjola,’ featuring Rita Dominic, Femi Jacobs, and Nonso Bassey.
