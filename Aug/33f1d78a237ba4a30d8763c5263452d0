The Media Campaign Council of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Edo for the September 19 governorship election has accused Governor Godwin Obaseki of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) of running on excuses, deceit and blackmail. It noted incumbent governments always run for re-election on their achievements and records in office but not in the case of Edo. Chairman of the council, Prince John Mayaki, in a statement, described Obaseki as a confused governorship candidate, who lacks administrative skills and frittered away his goodwill. It said: “Obaseki’s re-election campaign is an assault on commonsense, decency and ethics. “He has failed to articulate his achievements in the last four years, even in special media charades put together by what is left of his tattered team of staff. “When they rushed to launch a farcical MEGA (Making Edo Great Again) plan that is now nowhere to be found and thrust the embattled Edo governor in front of cameras, he stuttered, fumbled and ended up saying nothing, other than the fact that his administration was a MEGA failure and his entire re-election campaign a MEGA circus. “Unfortunately for Obaseki and his allies, the people of Edo State are not in need of clowns. “What they want is a prepared governor like Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu of the APC, who has a visible manifesto, the SIMPLE agenda, and specific plans on how to deal with the challenges confronting the state.”
