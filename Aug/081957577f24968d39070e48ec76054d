With the crisis in the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) yet to abate, one of its contractors and a major construction company, Webster Global Ventures Limited, has described its inclusion in the list of companies allegedly coerced to be paid by the National Assembly as a deliberate effort to destroy its reputation. The company described the statement credited to the Acting Managing Director of the NDDC, Prof. Kemebradikumo Daniel Pondei as false, inaccurate, and misleading. In a statement made available to our correspondent in Lagos, the company said that the National Assembly never influenced any payment made to it by the NDDC. In the statement signed on behalf of the company by the Director of Operations, Mr. Opeolu Adarae, he said, “We are a company of international repute. No one should dent our image. National Assembly never influenced any payment made to our company, because we completed all projects handled by us. “We have been in existence for 20 years. We have never been involved in fraud. Nobody gave us recommendation. The company does not have any business with the National Assembly. The Executive Director, Project, of the NDDC, Dr. Cairo Ojuogboh inspected the project we completed and certified it.” The company further urged the management of the NDDC to count Webster Global Ventures Limited out of the ongoing saga with the National Assembly.
