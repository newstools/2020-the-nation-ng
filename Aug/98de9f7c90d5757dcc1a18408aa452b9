A purported zoning arrangement for the 2021 governorship election in Anambra State is dividing Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state, it was learnt. Ten aspirants are calling for a candidate from the south, but the party denied a zoning arrangement. Former Governor Chukwuemeka Ezeife is leading another party heavyweight, Prince Nicholas Ukachukwu, to champion zoning. PDP Chairman Ndubuisi Nwobu said every aspirant would get equal opportunity at the primaries. He maintained that PDP had no zoning arrangement, saying the party was looking for someone with capacity to win the governorship. One of the aspirants, Obiora Okonkwo, said the party had no zoning arrangement. He said he was ready for primaries, but would support whoever won a credible contest. During a weekend meeting called by Ezeife and Ukachukwu at Osumenyi, Nnewi South Local Government, other aspirants from the south insisted it was their turn. Chris Azubuogu; Prince Nicholas Ukachukwu; Uche Ekwunife; Chuma Nzeribe; Ugochukwu Okeke and Emeka Etiaba; Obunike Ohaegbu; Ifedi Okwenna; Valentine Ozigbo and Godwin Ezeemo argued for the south. A communiqué signed by the 10 aspirants and Ezeife reads: “We reiterate our support for the existing zoning arrangement for the governorship position. We re-affirm that the next governor shall emerge from Anambra South in line with the zoning arrangement. “Whoever wins the primaries and is from Anambra South shall be supported. We appreciate the leaders, stakeholders, National and State Assembly members for their goodwill messages. We also appreciate the National Working Committee (NWC) for correcting the erroneous statement ascribed to it that portrayed the party as anti-zoning in Anambra.”
