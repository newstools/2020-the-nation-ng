The Director-General, Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE), Mr. Alex A. Okoh has assured workers of the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST) that  the on-going reform of the postal service will not attract job losses or retrenchment but will rather create more jobs in the subsidiaries that would emerge after the reform. Receiving the leadership of the National Union of Postal and Telecommunications Employees (NUPTE), led by its President, Rev.  Nehemiah G. Buba, who visited him in Abuja, Okoh said NIPOST after the reform would still remain 100 per cent entity of the Federal Government as the reform only aims at commercialising its services and making it robust to deliver more efficient postal service. BPE Head Public Communications,Amina Tukur Othman stated  this in a statement on Wednesday. Okoh  told the labour leaders that three commercial ventures – NIPOST Properties & Development Company; NIPOST Transport & Logistics Company and NIPOST Microfinance Bank Limited have been carved out of  NIPOST. He said the reform will lead to the emergence of Nigerian Postal Commission (NPC) as a regulator of the sector to ensure efficiency, service delivery and check abuses.
