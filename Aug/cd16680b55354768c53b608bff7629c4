Stroemsgodset attacking midfielder, Ipalibo Jack who injured his knee on Sunday in their 3-2 away win over FK Haugesund says he is working with the team doctors to ensure that he recovers in time before their Saturday tie with Viking. Ipalibo was replaced by Marcus Moelvadgaard in the 73rd minute as a precaution after he got a knock on his knee and the midfielder confirmed he has begun working with the club physiotherapist to ensure he is fully recovered for the weekend tie. The former Villarreal youth team player expressed joy at the away win which he said compensated for their 4-3 collapse at home to Sandefjord in their previous game and he affirmed that they are going into the tie with Viking with the zeal to extend their winning streak. “I couldn’t complete our game with FK Haugesund because I got a slight knock and I was withdrawn as a precaution so that the injury is not aggravated,” explained Ipalibo. “It was a battling win for us because we were close to missing vital two points again despite the fact that we were two goals up.” But were fortunate to get the winning goal in the dying moments of the game.” Ipalibo has made 13 league appearances for Stroemsgodset this season.
