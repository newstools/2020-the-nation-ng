Access Bank Plc has rewarded more than 9,000 customers in its DiamondXtra campaign tagged XtraWins; a seasonal offer leveraging the ongoing DiamondXtra campaign to reward customers for saving and transacting on the bank’s digital channels. Head, Consumer Banking, Access Bank Plc, Adaeze Umeh said the XtraWins initiative was borne out of the need to encourage customers to remain safe as they carry out their transactions in this COVID-19 PERIOD. According to her, the initiative is also aimed at rewarding loyal customers for choosing digital channels, giving them the opportunity to win cash prizes for performing transactions daily using the Access Bank USSD code *901# or the AccessMore App. “In our own little way of showing appreciation to our customers for their patronage and better returns on their savings, we launched the XtraWins campaign to ensure our loyal customers are rewarded. We have rewarded more than 100 customers every day and over 1,000 every week with various cash prizes since the beginning of the campaign which started about 10 weeks ago,” Umeh said. She added that customers can win between N500 and N1 million when they maintain a minimum of N1,000 in their accounts and conduct at least five transactions daily using the bank’s USSD code *901# or the Access More app to purchase airtime, pay bills and make transfers among other services. “The beauty about the Xtrawins campaign is that customers can win repeatedly as long as they keep transacting with our digital channels and carry out the number of transactions required to qualify for the daily draws,” Umeh said. Meanwhile, some of the XtraWins lucky winners took to their social media platforms to express their excitement and gratitude to the bank. Ube James, who won N100,000, said he had to invest the money so that he would always remember the feat.
