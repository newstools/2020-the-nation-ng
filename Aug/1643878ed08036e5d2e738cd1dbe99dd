The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the Malian military junta have reached an agreement on the transition programme. The military junta, which had insisted on a three- year programme, settled for the formation of a civilian transitional government to run the affairs of the country in the next twelve months. This agreement was contained in the declaration made available to the media after a video conference meeting among the Heads of State, the ECOWAS Mediator, Goodluck Jonathan, and the CNSP leadership, the military body running the country. The Summit was said to have considered the report of the mission by the ECOWAS Mediator, which took place from Saturday 22 to Monday 24 August 2020, to assess the recent developments in Mali. The summit called on the Malian military leadership to immediately begin the process for a civilian transition in consultation with the Constitutional Court as well as all relevant parties and stakeholders. ECOWAS urged them to take into account the following considerations: Appointment of a Transition President. He/she should be a civilian and known for his/her professional qualities as well as intellectual and moral probity and shall be responsible for leading the transition. The Transition President will not stand as a candidate in the next presidential election. The Summit also took note of the decision of President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita to resign as stated by the Mediator and also welcomed his release as well as the other detained government officials.
