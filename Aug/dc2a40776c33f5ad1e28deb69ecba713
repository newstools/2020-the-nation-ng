 NIGERIAN musician, Emeke Seun Otuata aka Styleh has called on the Nigerian government to create an enabling environment for artists to thrive. Lamenting the impoverished status of most of the Nigerian music acts, Styleh observed that lack of government appropriate policy has made telecoms providers and radio stations to grow their businesses at the expense of Nigerian musicians who toil day and night to make a living. The musician whose recent single ‘Eleda,’ is currently making waves, blamed the plight of Nigerian artistes on radio stations saying they do not help matters. To salvage this situation, Styleh called on the government to create an enabling environment for the entertainment industry by making it mandatory for radio stations and the telecom service providers to pay appropriate monetary dues to artistes when their works are deployed for their business interest. Styleh urged the government to be proactive in enabling policies for youth encouragement and empowerment programs.
