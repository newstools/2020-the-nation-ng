If Archbishop Margaret Idahosa’s name doesn’t ring a bell for some, Archbishop Benson Idahosa’s name will surely do. Apart from being a preacher too in her own right, she was married to the late popular clergyman, who died on March 12, 1999. Earlier in the week, the first female Archbishop in Africa celebrated her 70th birthday. Her birthday celebration was not short of love as family members and friends stormed social media to shower her with best wishes while appreciating her contributions to Christendom and society at large. Although her husband died many years ago, Archbishop Idahosa has ensured that his legacies live on. The woman of substance has a great passion for the needy, which prompted the establishment of a home for the motherless, ‘My Sister’s Place.’ She has authored many books that serve as a guide to Christians. Born on July 29, 1943, she is presently President of Church of God Mission International and Vice Chancellor of Benson Idahosa University (BIU), Benin City.
