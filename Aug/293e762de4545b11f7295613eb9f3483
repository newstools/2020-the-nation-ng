Chairman, Aliko Dangote Foundation and Africa’s foremost philanthropist, Aliko Dangote, has urged governments to increase budgetary allocations to the healthcare sector to enhance improved basic healthcare for Africans. Dangote spoke at the formal certification of Wild Poliovirus Eradication in Africa during a virtual forum by the World Health Organisation (WHO) Regional Office for Africa. He expressed deep satisfaction at the final eradication of wild polio in Nigeria, and by extension Africa after years of hard work and collaboration among stakeholders. The renowned humanitarian, who was commended alongside Co-Chair of Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Bill Gates by President Muhammadu Buhari for their vital interventions in the strengthening of Routine Immunisation (RI) in Nigeria, pledged to devote more of his wealth to support the provision of adequate quality healthcare to curb maternal and child mortality. Dangote, who played a major role through his Foundation in the eradication of Polio in Nigeria, said: “Ending wild polio in Africa is a giant leap forward. We have shown that if we stay clear-eyed and committed to a goal, we can get results. “We must always be tenacious to get where we want to go. I know Bill understands that too. We need to apply the same mindset on public health across Africa, beginning with us here today. The onus is on us to continue this push forward until polio in all its forms is gone forever.” He added: “There is no better time than now. We must be dedicated to this fight, and make the sustained investments in immunisations, medical workers, and public health that will make a difference. “We must also make a sustained political commitment – until the job is done – that we will achieve this goal. And that we will hold ourselves accountable for the results, good or bad. “I also pledge to continue helping in this fight any way I can. I believe the private sector and government are natural partners.”
