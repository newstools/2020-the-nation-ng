Emir of Ilorin Alhaji Ibrahim Sulu-Gambari has urged members of Ilorin emirate and Kwarans to pray for the success of the Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, Prof Ibrahim Agboola Gambari in office. The monarch also urged the former envoy to use his good office to better the lot of Ilorin people in particular and Kwara state in Nigeria. Alhaji Sulu-Gambari said this in Ilorin, the state capital during the distribution of over 2,000 facemasks and hand washing basins to residents and some selected worship centres in Ilorin metropolis. The programme was organized by Prof Ibrahim Agboola Gambari Movement (PIAGAM). Represented by the Balogun Fulani of Ilorin Alhaji AbubakarnAtiku-Fulani, the emir “I implore the Prof Gambari to spare a thought for the teeming jobless youth roaming around the nooks and crannies of the state. This position is not easy to come by, therefore, I urge him to make optimum use of it for the betterment of our youths.” In a remark, Special Adviser to Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq on Strategies, Gidaddo Alakawa said the programme was in line with the state government’s vision of youth empowerment. “I appeal to us all to that the reward for hard work is working harder. Ilorin youth by extension Kwara youth are no cultists. We are ready to work if given the opportunity.”
Earlier, PIAGAM President Mallam Alabi S. Hammed said that the “priority of the movement is the provision of job opportunities for our teaming unemployed youth. PIAGAM is founded to project and amplify the good image of our uncle; to serve as a platform that can fast-track good fortunes for our people and as a mechanism for feedback and suggestion. “With Prof Gambari’s appointment, we believe that Ilorin deserves to benefit more. We believe he has to touch more lives here and assist Ilorin indigenes to stand on their feet. We believe he needs to set a record here that will further entrench his legacy.”
