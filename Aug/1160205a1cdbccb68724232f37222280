 EKITI State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, has recovered from coronavirus after the test conducted on him returned negative for the virus. Fayemi, who had spent 11 days in self- isolation, announced his recovery yesterday via his verified Twitter handle@Kfayemi. The governor had last week confirmed on his Twitter handle that the result of his Covid-19 test turned out positive. The governor had, thereafter, gone into isolation with some of his aides who later confirmed positive taking similar steps. Fayemi tweeted: “After 11 days in isolation, I received news that my CoviD-19 repeat test came back negative. “My sincere gratitude goes to God Almighty, my family, my medical team and all well-wishers for the prayers and solidarity. “We must continue to do all we can to tackle the pandemic”, he tweeted.
