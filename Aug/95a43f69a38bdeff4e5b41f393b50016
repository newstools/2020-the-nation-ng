Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE) in Anambra State has warned ‘miscreants’ against parading themselves as union leaders. It cautioned them against inciting workers against the government and painting the union in a bad light. NULGE President Adigwe Chikwelu told reporters yesterday after the State Executive Council (SEC) meeting, that there was no faction in the union. He alleged that the parallel leadership of Chudy Orakwue as president and Kelechi Ezeibe as public relations officer was sponsored by an opponent of the Governor Willie Obiano administration. According to him, security agencies had warned the impostors to steer clear of the union. “We learnt they challenged our predecessor’s tenure extension, which last year’s election put to rest. ‘’He went around … parading himself as NULGE president …and accused the government of delaying the salary harmonisation for workers, and failure to implement 2016 promotion.” But Chikwelu said the crisis was rested on Tuesday following a meeting called by Chairman of the Local Government Service Commission Peter Egenti. He said Orakwue and his team were warned against importing strange elements into the union and advised to seek redress in court. “We want the public to disregard the fictitious letters and blackmail. There’s no two NULGE in the state except the recognised one under Adigwe Chikwelu. “We’ve pardoned them and extended olive branch to them…I’ve decided to withdraw every action I had intended to take. We’ll temper justice with mercy,” he added.
