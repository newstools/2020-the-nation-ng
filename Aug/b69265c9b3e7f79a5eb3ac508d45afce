The only lawmaker elected on the platform of the Zenith Labour Party in the Ondo House of Assembly, Leonard Tomide Akinribido, has been suspended. Akinribido, who is representing Ondo West Constituency 1, was suspended over gross misconduct and use of vulgar words against Speaker Bamidele Oleyelogun in the Hallowed Chamber and on WhatsApp platform. Akinribido was ordered to drop official documents in his care and asked to stay away from the premises of the Assembly complex during the period of the suspension. The Assembly had three weeks ago suspended three lawmakers for gross misconduct. Those earlier suspended were Deputy Speaker Iroju Ogundeji, Hon.Adewale Williams and Hon. Favour Tomomewo.
