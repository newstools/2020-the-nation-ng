Second Head of House, Lucy has revealed she is attached to Praise but she can’t be with him for some reasons. She made this known during her diary session. Lucy said the only guy she is attracted to is Praise but she can’t be with him due to the circumstances that surround him outside the House. The fact that Praise is engaged and has a son is a turn off. “If I was to pick a romantic partner it would be Praise, I’m attracted to him but due to circumstances outside the house we can’t be together,” she stated.
