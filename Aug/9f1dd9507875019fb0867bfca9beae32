Super Eagles forward, Josh Maja, opened his goal account for the season with a 25th  minute  strike in Bordeaux’s 2-0 Ligue 1 match at Angers. The 21-year-old former Sunderland trainee reacted first to ex-Arsenal captain Laurent Koscielny’s knockdown from a corner to open scoring for Bordeaux in the 25th minute before Croatian midfielder Toma Basic put the game to bed two minutes later. Maja was subbed out in the 66th minute for Jimmy Briand while compatriot Samuel Kalu came in in the 78th minute for Ui-Jo Hwang. Elsewhere, Moses Simon was on for 90 minutes in Nantes 2-1 win over Nimes while Henry Onyekuru, starting for the first time, left the pitch in the 59th minute for Jean Aholou in Monaco’s 1-0 win at Metz. In Belgium, three Nigerians were in action as Club Brugge recorded a 2-1 win at Genk to record their second win in the Jupiler League. Emmanuel Dennis justified his start for Club Brugge by providing the assist for the Belgian champions to open scoring at rivals KRC Genk, while Super Eagles call-up Cyriel Dessers missed a penalty for the home team. Dennis, who has long been linked with a transfer away from Club Brugge, crossed the ball for it to be headed home after 19 minutes. Genk then had a chance to draw level from the penalty spot at the start of the second half, but Dessers, who started the game after compatriot Paul Onuachu was withdrawn from the starting XI because he is not 100% fit, saw his shot come off the post. Olympic Eagles striker David Okereke started his first match this season for Club Brugge after playing a total of 34 minutes in the team’s first three matches.
