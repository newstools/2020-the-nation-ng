The Shehu of Borno, Alhaji Abubakar Ibn Umar Garbai Elkanemi has decried the recent attack on the state governor Babagana Zulum by Boko Haram, saying his people are no longer safe. The Borno monarch also declared that citizens of the state are no longer safe and requested the people to raise their hands and seek the face of Allah in prayers. The Shehu who was reacting to the attack on the convoy of Gov. Babagana Umara Zulum at Baga last Wednesday during a traditional Sallah homage to the governor described the incident as “very unfortunate and a great pity”. “Your Excellency, we are not happy about what has happened in Baga the other time, it is very unfortunate and a great pity. If the convoy of the whole Chief Security Officer of the state will be attacked, then wallahi nobody is safe, because he is the number one citizen of the state, he is the Chief Security Officer of the State. “If a convoy of such highly placed people in the State will be attacked, I repeat, nobody is safe. The matter is getting worse, I urge everyone to raise up our hands to seek Allah’s intervention,” the royal father said. The Shehu during his remarks also called on all people living in Borno to take the COVID-19 pandemic seriously by complying with all medical directives and preventive protocols to mitigate the spread of the virus in the state. The royal father was equally disturbed by the indiscriminate felling of trees which is aggravating the desertification, while calling on the government to reintroduce the annual and regular tree planting as it was the practice in the past. Gov. Zulum in a brief remark expressed his gratitude to the royal father for his homage. He assured that his Government will look at the possibility of addressing the issues raised.
