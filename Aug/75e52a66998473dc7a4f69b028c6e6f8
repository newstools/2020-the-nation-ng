Spanish giants FC Barcelona have sacked Manager Quique Setien after an 8-2 humiliation by Bayern Munich in the Quarter finals of the Champion League. The club announced the sack in a statement on its website. It said: “The Board of Directors have agreed that Quique Setién is no longer the first team coach. “This is the first decision within a wider restructuring of the first team which will be agreed between the current technical secretary and the new coach, who will be announced in the coming days.” Setién joined Barça on 13 January after the sack of Ernesto Valverde. His sack was not unexpected after the Club’s President Bartomeu promised far-reaching changes following its biggest defeat in the competition.
