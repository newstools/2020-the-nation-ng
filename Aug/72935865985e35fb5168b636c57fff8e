 Some Abia State indigenes living in different cities in the United Kingdom have threatened to organise a protest march to the British Parliament and Nigerian High Commission in the country against the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), should the anti-corruption agency continues to keep quiet over corruption cases it has against former Abia State Governor, Senator T. A. Orji and his son, Chinedu Orji, the Speaker of Abia State House of Assembly. They said they will carry out the protest if in the coming days, the former governor and his son are not arraigned in a court of competent jurisdiction to clear themselves of the alleged mindless looting of Abia peopleâ€™s commonwealth. The threat was leaked by a group, Umuafo-Abia in the United Kingdom, which yesterday said the anti-corruption war of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government will result to a gimmick if after the highly publicised and detailed EFCC investigation of Senator Orji and Chinedu his son, the two leaders do not face immediate trial. In a press release made available to newsmen after the members of the group, made up of men and women of Abia state origin residing in all the counties of the United Kingdom, rose from a meeting in London, they said their next line of action was to ensure recovery of Abia looted funds. The release, signed by the publicity secretary of Umuafo-Abia, Professor Chibike Ubani, stated that it will be most pathetic if the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration, which is passionate about recovery of looted pubic funds/assets, fails to prosecute the Orjis over the alleged looting or diversion of Abia funds. The group also condemned the silence of the elders and political elites in the state who have refused to speak up against the continuous mindless looting of the state and threatened a mass protest against the EFCC to the British Parliament and the Nigerian High Commission.
