The appetite of football fans will be satisfied this weekend with access today’s UEFA Champions League clash between Manchester City and Olympique Lyonnais that will wrap up the quarterfinals. GOtv viewers can look forward to a potential thriller kicking off at 8pm on SuperSport Select 2 (channel 32), when City and Lyon meet at Estadio Jose Alvalade in Lisbon and battle for the last place in the semifinals. The teams met in the group stage of the competition last season and put up two thrilling clashes, with the Ligue 1 side winning 2-1 at the Etihad Stadium, while the return game at the Groupama Stadium ended in a 2-2 draw – both matches notably saw goals from Lyon’s Ivorian attacker Maxwel Cornet. The French side upset Juventus on away goals after they both tied  ended 2-2 on aggregate. Lyon’s Cameroonian forward Karl Toko Ekambi has warned that they should not be underestimated: “City are a very big club, but we have a chance; I wouldn’t say we’re the underdogs. If we are here, it is because we are among the top eight teams in Europe.” City, meanwhile, were able to complete an impressive triumph over La Liga champions Real Madrid last week, winning 2-1 at the Etihad Stadium (thanks to goals from Raheem Sterling and Gabriel Jesus) to take their round of 16 tie 4-2 on aggregate.
