 FUJI maestro, Abass Akande Obesere, has blessed fast rising artiste, Benjamin Oluwasegun Adeniyi aka Young B with a duet. Expressing his excitement on collaborating with Obesere, Young B said the Fuji singer was a musical influence on his formative years. “The Obesere sound was a solid part of growing up in Ilorin. I had uncles who would not go a day without listening to his music. He had this song he did with Reminisce in I think, 2017. The fusion and harmony was so beautiful and original. I just knew right there and then I had to make magic with Obesere,” Young B said. Young B also hinted that if given the opportunity to ditch, kiss and marry, top three female artists, it would be Yemi Alade, Tiwa Savage and Teni. He said: “These are all great women in the music industry. And I mean no disrespect laughs. I’ll marry Yemi Alade, kiss Tiwa Savage, and ditch Teni Makanaki in that respective order.” FUJI maestro, Abass Akande Obesere, has blessed fast rising artiste, Benjamin Oluwasegun Adeniyi aka Young B with a duet.
