Chiefs and elders of Igbesa, a community on Lagos/Ogun boundary, have called on Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun to approve the coronation of oba-elect, Prince Abdulazeez Oluwatoyin Akinde.
The elders, led by Chief Ajibola Olagbaiye, implored Abiodun to approve Akinde’s installation to quicken the town’s development.
Igbesa, a strategic Awori community, is a critical nexus between the industrial hubs of Agbara and Ota. It is also home to two major institutions – Gateway Polytechnic and Ogun-Guangdong Free Trade Zone.
The elders said the town’s progress had been put on hold by the delay in crowning its monarch, elected in 2017.
According to Chief Babatunde Fadun, a member of Ogun State Elders’ Council and head of Igbesa Kingmakers Committee, the absence of an oba had slowed down Igbesa’s vital role in the industrial resurgence of the axis intersecting Ogun and Lagos states, as well the ECOWAS sub-region.
He added that critical stakeholders in the town, including the lawmaker representing Ado Odo-Ota in the National Assembly, Jimoh Ojugbele, have consented to Akinde’s kingship.
