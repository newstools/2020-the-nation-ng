THE Debt Management Office (DMO) will resume its Offer of the Federal Government of Nigeria Savings Bond (FGN Savings Bond) with effect from August 2020. The DMO suspended the Monthly Offers of the bond in April 2020 due to the restrictions on activities and movement as part of measures adopted by the Government to curtail the spread of COVID-19. A statement from the DMO invited the public to look out for the advert of the Offer for Subscriptions in various newspapers and the DMO’s website. The offer for subscription will open on Monday, August 10, 2020 and close on
Friday, August 14, 2020.
The DMO urged investors “to continue saving through the FGN Savings Bond, as they attract good incomes and are secure, being a Sovereign instrument, whilst also, contributing to national development”.
