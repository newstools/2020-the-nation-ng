Singer Simi has questioned the educational system saying the process is worthless to an average individual. The mother of one said most of the things that were learned in school end up not being useful to the majority of the school leavers. The ‘Duduke’ singer noted that people only go to school because it is necessary. “Educational system is so shit, most of us can’t even remember what we were taught in all the many years we spent in school”, she wrote. “People have potential and talent not tapped into because it’s not prestigious enough then they spend years learning something they don’t care about. Forget everything right after and end up doing something else with their lives. What’s the point then? Who did this to us?”. Simi is an alumnus of Covenant University, where she studied Mass Communication. She has not practiced as a mass communicator since her graduation but rather has been excelling as a music star with over 10 hits in her name. Simi is married to her colleague, Adekunle Gold, with whom she has a son. Her husband broke into the limelight as a talented graphic artist but chose music as the path to fame and fortune.
