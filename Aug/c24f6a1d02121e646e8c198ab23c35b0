This year’s birthday will always be special for the new Oniru of Iruland, Lagos, Oba Abdulwasiu Omogbolahan Lawal (Abisogun II). This time last year, the one-time police officer never thought he would become a king at 50 and his next birthday would be on the throne of his forefathers. Although social distancing rule made the celebration low-key, close associates including Oba Saheed Elegushi, Lagos State Head of Service, Akeem Muri-Okunola and Deputy Governor, Dr. Obafemi Hamzat, still found a way to share in the excitement. Apart from the amazing cakes received – over seven giant cakes and other small ones – a major highlight of the celebration was the visit of hip-hop star, Naira Marley. The singer came unannounced late in the evening to celebrate with the monarch and pay homage, and that made Oba Lawal’s day. The king was overheard saying he thought he would be spending his 50th birthday in government, not knowing God had a bigger plan for him. He was formerly Lagos State Commissioner for Agriculture and Co-operatives.
