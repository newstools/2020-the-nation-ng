 Anambra state government has assured that the establishment of the Geographic Information System (GIS) in the Ministry of Lands, Survey and Urban Planning would put to rest double allocation, illegal taxation in land documentation and other related matters. Commissioner in the Ministry, Mr Bonaventure Enemali, gave the assurance in Awka, the state capital when State House of Assembly Committee on Tender and Procurement visited the Ministry to ascertain its mode of operation regarding land allocations. He also promissed that the GIS would ensure transparency and accuracy in the entire process. According to Enemali, the innovation followed government directive that all lands in the State would be electronically accessed to discourage fraudulent activities related to lands. He said, “The Electronics Data Management System (EDMS) will end paper documentation and forestall tale of files as it will capture land data online. This will also end extortion and promote prompt response to land applications. Our staff have been trained on land information and other related ICT programmes.” The House Committee led by Member representing Idemili South, Hon Chuka Ezenwune had inspected the Ministry’s environment as well as the hall for the Geographic Information System (GIS). Ezenwune observed that the new GIS would go a long way in solving the previous challenges of double allocation of lands. “We see such digital initiative in Abuja and it makes it easier to access your land or the state’s land anywhere in the world.We commend you for this noble cause and urge the pioneer staff to live up to expectations and ensure transparency and accuracy in their documentation, especially when it concerns figures,” he stated.
