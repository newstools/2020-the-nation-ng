Heartland head coach, Fidelis Ilechukwu, has refused to be categorical about his future despite mounting pressure from top NPFL clubs  to lure him away from the with the Naze Millionaires ahead of next league season tentatively fixed for September/October. Ilechukwu joined the Naze Millionaires at the beginning of the just concluded season after 13 meritorious years with MFM but his stay with the Owerri-based side  has  been blighted by unpaid salaries. “I’m sorry I don’t have anything new for you for now. I am still reviewing everything and it won’t be straightforward for me to decide my future now,” Ilechukwu informed. “It has been very difficult for us all at Heartland for the past six months or so with the non-payment of our salaries. We have been informed something will be done before this week runs out and we are waiting and hoping.” In a related development,  about four NPFL clubs have reportedly made  enquiries about the availability of Ilechukwu whose one year contract with Heartland has expired. But Ilechukwu who  is widely called ‘The Working One’  refused to comment on the development , saying everything about his future will be sorted out in due course.
