  Old Mutual Limited has partnered the Lagos State Ministry of Education to drive remote learning for pupils in vulnerable communities. Senior representatives from Old Mutual and the ministry kicked off the presentation of free 10,000 radio units to pupils at St. Francis Jnr Grammar School, Iwaya. The Executive Head, Marketing & Customer Experience, Old Mutual, Alero Ladipo, said the firm  would ensure that the remote learning initiative reached 10,000 homes by donating free radio units to schoolchildren across underprivileged districts in the state. She said: “We understand that despite the impressive growth in internet connectivity and access in Nigeria, there are low-income families who cannot afford to access internet-based virtual learning, which is fast becoming the conduit of remote education. “As an organisation, we believe that no one should be left behind in the provision of quality education. So, we are proud to partner the Lagos State Government, who shares the same ethos and have evolved a low-tech and affordable strategy to drive remote education through radio broadcasting. Our support is to enable children from 10,000 low-income families, who cannot afford a radio set, to be able to tune in to this remote education during this pandemic.” The Lagos State Commissioner for Education, Mrs. Folashade Adefisayo, represented by the Director, Public-Private Partnerships, Dr. Olufunke Oyetola stated that the support from Old Mutual would help the state in its quest to broaden the scope of education in the state. “The Old Mutual support is coming at a critical time we need more hands to help build the future of our children. This exemplary gesture will help us to accelerate the adoption of virtual and remote learning as education and schooling would never remain the same post-COVID-19,” she said.
