The crisis arising from the conduct of the primaries of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is yet to settle, as a governorship aspirant, Banji Okunomo and his supporters across the state have backed out of campaigns of Eyitayo Jegede. Jegede won the primary election of the PDP and was asked to pick one of the aspirants from Ondo South, who contested against him as running mate, but he picked a member of the House of Representatives, Gboluga Ikengboju.
