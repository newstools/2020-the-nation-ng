  NAPOLI President Aurelio De Laurentiis urged fans to be ‘patient’ with Nigeria International Victor Osimhen, explaining that the 21-year-old needs time to adapt to Italian football. De Laurentiis attended the Azzuris’ first pre-season training session yesterday at the Castel di Sangro, where Osimhen scored from a Kevin Malcuit cross and was paired with Belgium international Dries Mertens in the reduced field. Osimhen is expected to light up Serie A after a brilliant season in the French Ligue 1 where he scored 18 goals and recorded six assists in 38 appearances across all competitions for Lille, earning him a big money move to Italy becoming the Naples-based side’s most expensive signing. “The fans ought to be patient with him, because Osimhen hasn’t played in seven months and still needs to get to know Italian football,” De Laurentiis told Radio Kiss Kiss. “I urge the fans to give him time and space, so he can help the team. Rino Gattuso won’t give anyone an easy time.” Meanwhile, Napoli coach Gennaro Gattuso doesn’t rule out a change of formation after the arrival of Victor Osimhen, adding the former Charleroi forward will give his team different attacking opportunities as the season unfolds. Gattuso has been using a 4-3-3 formation since he took over the Azzurri and only changed formation once in his first 30 games, against Barcelona in the Champions League. The Partenopei coach has revealed he looks forward to having Osimhen at his disposal and won’t rule out using a different system with the Nigerian forward in the squad. “It could be, he has different characteristics than those we had,” Gattuso said at a press conference. “He can give us the opportunity to attack spaces; he has great physical strength and I think he can give us a big hand.”
