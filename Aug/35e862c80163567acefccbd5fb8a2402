 SONGSTRESS Simi has explained why she retracted her comments on homosexuals in one of the editions of her YouTube show, ‘Stoopid Sessions.’ The Duduke singer took to her social media accounts to retract her statements saying “I carelessly and casually addressed an issue that is a matter of life and death for many. It was not my intention to hurt you, but I did and I’m sorry.” The former X3m records artiste further said though she understands discrimination, she may not understand the unique ways which the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer (LGBTQ) community experiences it. “As a woman, I understand discrimination, but I realize I may not understand the unique ways the LGBTQ community experiences it. I am learning, but I’m sorry that this time, I did so at your expense,” she said. She took back her words in a lengthy formal appeal saying: “To members of the LGBTQ community – Nobody deserves hate like you’re often given. Nobody should have to live in fear. “At first, I didn’t understand your anger, because I honestly thought I was admitting to and questioning my bias. I believe you misunderstood me, so I wasn’t sure how to respond. “I found out someone was almost killed very recently because they are a member of the LGBTQ community. This, and the knowledge of those globally who have died or been hurt for similar reasons, has humbled me. I see how the things we say, even without meaning to, can encourage prejudice. Your life is bigger, by far than my pride.” The mother of one was chided by one of Nigeria’s leading LGBTQ community, Bisi Alimi, earlier in the year for her comments on homosexuals and transgenders.
