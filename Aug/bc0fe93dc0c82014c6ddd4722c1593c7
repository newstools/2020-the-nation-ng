The Aiye Dera Independent Support Group, a body backing the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr. Eyitayo Jegede, has explained why it has adopted house-to-house campaign for the party’s standard-bearer. The organisation has trained over 400 volunteers that will help in the door-to-door campaign. The group’s Coordinator, Ayokanmi Edu, told reporters in Ondo town that the volunteers would take PDP message of hope to people in their homes. Edu, who hoped that the people would appreciate the new campaign approach, said the project would be experimented in Ondo West Local Government before taking it to other towns. He said: “We believe in the aspiration of Jegede. We have organised a structure of campaign with 466 volunteers from the local governments. They will move from house-to-house telling the people why they should vote for the PDP. “We have trained them in how to meet people and talk to them convincingly. We believe the people will appreciate this method.” A member of the team, Bode Obanla, said it was a scientific approach to political campaign. “We want to bring a new approach to campaigns. We will give them kits. Those trained will move from house-to-house. Jegede is the right person to lead the state,” he added.
