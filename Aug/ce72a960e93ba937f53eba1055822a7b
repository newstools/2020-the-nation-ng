 Their lordships are grumbling and the temple of justice may just be set for unprecedented protests unless something urgently is done to address the complaints of judges in the country. Sentry learnt that at the center of the jurists’ discontent is President Muhammadu Buhari’s proposal that criminal cases from the High Court to the Supreme Court should be concluded within a year. Although happy that the long-awaited reforms in the judiciary is about to start, they are unhappy that about 2,000 judges may be saddled with sorting out almost 120,000 pending cases within the stipulated time. Our findings show that the judges and other stakeholders in the sector would rather have the problem of shortage of judges nationwide addressed first before the time limit for court cases is considered. “Let Mr. President talk about the judges that will do the job. We must not saddle a few people with too much work just because we want to make speed; otherwise it will turn out to be more motion, less speed at the end of the day. Sincerely, that’s the opinion among us,” one judge told Sentry on Thursday. According to feelers, the National Judicial Council (NJC) will be representing a request for the appointment of more judges to the government in preparation for the eventual implementation of the presidential time limit proposal. “We also want fast discharge of justice. But we think the manpower to get this done needs to be provided first,” another judge said.
