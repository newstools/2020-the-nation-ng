Edo State Commissioner of Police Babatunde Kokumo has paraded six persons suspected to have raped and murdered a student of University of Benin (UNIBEN), Uwaila Vera Omozuwa at a parish of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Ihovbe Quarters, Benin. The suspects, who were paraded on Wednesday at Edo police headquarters in Benin, were Nelson Ogbebor, Akato Valentine, Mrs. Tina Samuel, Mrs. Mary Ade, Nosa Osabohien and Collins Ulegbe. Kokumo told reporters that his officers and men intensified efforts to unravel the circumstances surrounding the violent attack on the late undergraduate. He said, “The matter was a great concern to the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Muhammed Adamu. What we are seeing today (yesterday) is a result of the efforts of the police to get to the root of the crime. I wish to announce to you that the perpetrators have been arrested. “The postmortem result actually confirmed that the victim was raped.” The UNIBEN undergraduate went to the RCCG to read, when the criminals went into the church, attacked and raped her, but she later died at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH).
