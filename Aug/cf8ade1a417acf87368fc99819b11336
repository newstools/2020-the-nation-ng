Lionel Messi is reportedly keen for former Barcelona teammate Neymar to join him at Manchester City. The speculation surrounding Messi’s future has gathered pace since he informed Barca that he wants to leave the club during this summer’s transfer window. Man City are viewed by many as the favourites to sign the Argentina international, who would reunite with Pep Guardiola should he make the move to the Etihad Stadium. According to ESPN Brasil, Messi is keen to join the Citizens and has held private talks with Paris Saint-Germain attacker Neymar about the possibility of joining him in Manchester. The report claims that Messi has spoken to his former teammate about his plans this summer and is keen to reunite with the Brazil international in the Premier League. In a related development, Josep Maria Bartomeu is reportedly prepared to resign as Barcelona president if it helps the club retain the services of Lionel Messi. With Barcelona desperate to keep Messi, TV3 claims that Bartomeu will end his stint at the club if Messi promises to extend his career in La Liga. The report suggests that Bartomeu would want Messi to publicly identify him as the biggest issue for wanting to take on a new challenge.
