The Presidency last night advised a former Speaker of the House of Representatives Ghali Umar Na’Abba not to bring President Muhammadu Buhari into whatever problem he has with security agencies. In a statement by Senior Special Assistant (SSA) to the President Mallam Garba Shehu, the Presidency decried what it described as Na’Abba’s “publicity stunt” because President Buhari has no issues with him. Na’Abba, according to a statement, had been invited by the Directorate of State Services (DSS) over an alleged comment on the President, an invitation, the statement said, he would honour today. But the Presidency said: “our findings have revealed that his invitation has nothing to do with the alleged irresponsible utterances which in any case did not catch the attention of the Presidency, or of any serious politician for that matter.” The statement added that “there are serious politicians who talk, and the Presidency respond, because such politicians throw jibes which must get attention. “Flash in the pan politicians and those who fabricate political relevance don’t bother anyone. “We advise Na’Abba to distance the Presidency from the situation he has found himself and sort himself out accordingly.”
