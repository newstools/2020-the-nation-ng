Governor Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom State confirmed on Monday that a pupil writing the ongoing West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) had contracted COVID-19. Emmanuel, who made this known at a news conference in Uyo, however did not mention the name of the pupil and the school. The governor said the student was asymptomatic, and had been writing the examinations from isolation centre to avoid spread. He however said the state government had begun random testing of pupils across the state for the virus. “We have tested over 100 pupils and it is only one young man who tested positive for COVID-19. “We did what we ought to do medically; I want to believe that by now, the young man should be okay,” he said.
