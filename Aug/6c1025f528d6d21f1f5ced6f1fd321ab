The Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) has destroyed substandard liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders and aluminum and corrugated roofing sheets worth over N450 million, for failing the minimum requirement of the standards. Speaking to the reporters during the exercise, its Director, Inspectorate and Compliance Directorate, Obiora Manafa, said the fake goods being destroyed had been categorised as life-endangering. Manafa, who spoke in Lagos on Wednesday, stressed that despite invested in reducing the nefarious act, inferior goods still penetrate the countryâ€™s market. He said the agency will achieve its mandate, stressing that more culprits would be jailed as there are more litigations going on in the court. He recalled that the fake LPG cylinders are from China, while the used ones were imported from Turkey and without SONCAP certificates.
