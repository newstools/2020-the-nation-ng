 THE Media Campaign Council of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has alleged that Governor Godwin Obaseki is battling to justify his deceitful public service promotion claim. It added that Obaseki embarked on secret inauguration of members of the Edo State Judicial Service Commission, in view of its exposure of the deceitful announcement made by him for the beginning of public service promotions, despite lacking constitutional power to follow through on the directive. The campaign council, through its Chairman, Prince John Mayaki, yesterday in an online statement, alleged that Obaseki had spurned requests to inaugurate a functional judicial service commission for many months, because he desired to lord over Edo like an emperor. It alleged that the governor was scampering about over the secret inauguration, similar to the sham he orchestrated at the House of Assembly during nocturnal hours of June 17, 2019, to justify a public service promotion claim he made, but was exposed by the APC as mere empty gesture, play to the gallery and a deceitful announcement made to obtain votes. The campaign council challenged Obaseki to explain his refusal to inaugurate the commission for months, despite approving a reconstitution, but he decided to secretly do the same thing on the eve of the election and days after his purported directive for the commencement of due promotions in the public service was revealed as a weightless announcement outside the power of his office. It also accused Obaseki of acting as if he had supreme power, reiterating that in a democracy, elected offices had limits and stipulated tenure. Obasekiâ€™s Special Adviser on Media and Communication Strategy, Crusoe Osagie, did not react to the allegations levelled against his boss at press time.
