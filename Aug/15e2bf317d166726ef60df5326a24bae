Unidentified gunmen suspected to be cultists stormed Luebe community in Khana Local Government Area of Rivers state, killing a chief and three other residents. It was gathered that the bandits also attacked a nearby Loore community at about 12 noon on Tuesday and killed another chief identified simply as Ajeboy around. The Ajeboy reportedly became a chief in his community last year following the death of his father. A source, who spoke in confidence, said the incident occurred shortly after a rumoured death of an ex-militant leader. The source said that the gunmen besieged the community shooting ceaselessly in protest to the rumour, which they said emanated from the community. He said: “We believe the gunmen were members of Icelanders cult group, they attacked Luebe community during the late hours of Monday and killed three boys. “On Tuesday, around 12 noon, they continued their shooting and killed a chief from the community. “They were angry that a rumour started from the community that the ex-militant was dead whereas he is still alive.” When contacted, the Spokesman of the Rivers state Police Command, Nnamdi Omoni said he was yet to be briefed about the incident.
