Seven persons have been remanded in police custody for the invasion on August 6 of the Edo State House of Assembly by armed thugs. Justice Efe Ikponmwonba of the state High Court, Benin yesterday remanded Festus Agbonrenren, 25, Odion Osayande, 23, Ogbeiwe Wilfred, 52, Morgan Uwaigboe, 47, Osayomore Salami, 25, Ifeoluwa Oladele, 36, and Iginobaro Collins, 26, pending the determination of the case on September 3. The seven suspects are being prosecuted for alleged illegal possession of firearms and disturbance of public peace. They were reportedly arrested within the premises of the state Assembly complex with five double-barrel and two single-barrel guns with 10 live cartridges. Police sources said the suspects confessed being  sponsored by aides of a prominent politician in the state bent on thwarting the efforts of an opponent in the upcoming election. The seven suspects reportedly provided cover for other thugs who removed the roof of the Assembly complex, vandalised its chambers and heaped sand and granite at its entrance. Justice Ikponmwonba asked the police prosecuting counsel, Mr. Akomen Adaghe, to produce the suspects on September 3, when their plea would be taken.
