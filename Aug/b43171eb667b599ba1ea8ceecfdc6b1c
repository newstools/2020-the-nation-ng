 MUSIC act Oritselaju Ejuetami aka Laaj has unveiled his plans for his music and modeling career. Speaking on his career, the singer cum model disclosed that he started his music career at the tender age of 12, and he patterned his music style after legends like Michael Jackson, Fela Kuti and Bob Marley. On how he copes with two apparently demanding fronts, the self-sponsored artiste who is signed to his label, Laju Records, revealed that his passion for the two entertainment crafts and consistency in doing them over the years meant that he’s able to seamlessly combine singing and modeling. The singer, who hails from Delta State but grew up in Lagos, got tongues wagging about his talent with his chart-topping single, ‘Trouble’. He followed it up with ‘Uplifted’ featuring Duncan Mighty, ‘Baller’ featuring Slimcase and Mr. Real, and ‘Money is power’ featuring DJ Consequence. The songs, many believe, set him apart as one act who understands the music space and knows how to get his fans talking about him.
