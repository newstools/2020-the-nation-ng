Our Reporter Renowned educationist, Mrs. Adenike Okudoh, has charged stakeholders in the education sector on the urgent need to revisit, review and reshape the country’s school curriculum to align with the fast-evolving world, so that Nigerian children will remain relevant in the global space. Okudoh, who is the Director of Queensland Academy, noted that by using the two powerful tools of education and entrepreneurial skills, students will remain socio-economically relevant especially in the 21st century. According to her, this is what has formed the basis of the curriculum run at Queensland Academy which has birthed several amazing testimonies from students and alumni. Speaking on the future of work at the the school’s Entrepreneurship Summit, held virtually via Zoom, Okudoh said that in sub-Saharan Africa and particularly poor countries around the world, 75 million jobs will cease to exist in the next 10 years. She said the new jobs that would evolve will require new skills such as problem solving, critical thinking, creative thinking, team bonding among others. “The Nigerian child needs to be equipped with these skills through quality entrepreneurial education within our schools which goes beyond mere skill acquisition programmes. “Globally, companies are more interested in employing people who have these required skills rather just the certificates. In fact in the next few years, certificates will become more and less relevant. The employability of the Nigerian students will therefore depend on the skills they can bring to the table. “Hence, there is no gainsaying that the future of the workplace is rapidly changing and the big question is if our education system is preparing our children for this place. This is a cause for concern to all stakeholders in the Nigerian education space. The Nigerian child must be future ready.”
