Former Manchester City captain, Vincent Kompany, has retired from football. The Manchester City legend, 34, took the job as player-manager of the Belgian giants last summer. The former centre-back Kompany won four Premier League titles at Man City – two of which were under Guardiola. Kompany also won four League Cups and two FA Cups during his time at the Etihad where he became a legend. His wonder-goal against Leicester late in 2018-19 helped secure the title in his last season at the club will go down in Etihad folklore. After leaving City – with over 350 appearances to his name – Kompany took the job as player-manager at Anderlecht, his first-ever club.
