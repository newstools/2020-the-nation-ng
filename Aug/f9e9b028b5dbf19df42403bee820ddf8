Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) said on Tuesday that the demarcation fence beside Mechanic Village in the Mafoluku area of Ikeja is not a threat to security at the Murtala Muhammed Airport, Lagos. Its General Manager, Public Affairs, Mrs. Henrietta Yakubu who disclosed this said the fence in question, is a demarcation of the airport authority land and the Mafoluku axis illegally used by residents to access their neighbourhood. She said though there was no pedestrian gate for residents to access Concord Bus Stop, the residents may have inadvertently resorted to the use of ladder. Mrs. Yakubu said a joint patrol inspection was conducted by the Head of Unit, Joint Military Task Force and Crime Investigation and Intelligence around the apron indicating that the area was not under any threat despite its proximity to the airport. The FAAN official said: “The said area is not a security threat to the airport since it is off FAAN perimeter fence. The residents have been warned to stop using the place as an access. “There is no pedestrian gate for the resident to access the Concord bus stop that perhaps the reason for the use of the ladder.”
