Bishop Oyedepo’s daughter, Joyce Oyedepo exchanged marital vows with her heartthrob Abimbola Abodunrin as they officially became husband and wife on Saturday. The 28 year old and last child of the President and Founder of the Living Faith Church Worldwide, was joined in Holy Matrimony with her husband in a quiet wedding ceremony, which took place at the Covenant University Chapel, Canaanland, Ota, Ogun State. The couple had their traditional marriage at the same venue on Friday, which happened to be the 38th wedding anniversary of the Bishop and his wife. The excited Bishop who had taken to his Instagram page on Friday to pour adulation on his wife of 38 years, walked his daughter down the aisle during the wedding procession. His post read, “Happy Wedding Anniversary to my lovely wife @officialfaithoyedepo The journey thus far has been awesome with you by my side. You have been the true definition of a virtuous woman. Myself, the children (biological and spiritual) and grandchildren all call you blessed indeed. 38 years gone, forever to go with you. I love you.”
