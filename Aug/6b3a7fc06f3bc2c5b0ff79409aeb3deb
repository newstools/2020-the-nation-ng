The Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ) Akwa Ibom chapter has directed its members to boycott a press conference planned for a former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode. In a statement on Friday, the chapter asked journalists not to attend any activity organised by the former Minister. Fani-Kayode, who is in Akwa-Ibom, had insulted a reporter with DailyTrust, Eyo Charles, for asking him who was bankrolling his nationwide trips in Cross River last week. The ex-Minister, who began a tour of some states, especially those controlled by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) states in July, visited Cross River last week. He poured vituperations on the reporter, disparaging him as “very stupid”. “I could see from your face before you got here, how stupid you are. Don’t ever talk to me like that. Who do you think you’re talking to? Bankroll who? “You think I am one of those ones you… from who, when, how? You have a small mind, a very small mind. Don’t judge me by your own standards,” he had said. His comments had generated widespread criticism from many Nigerians and groups, including the NUJ which described him as “intolerant and unstable”.
