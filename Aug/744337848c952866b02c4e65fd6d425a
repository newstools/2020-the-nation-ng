The Executive Secretary, Borno State Geographic Information Service (BOGIS) Adam Bababe on Wednesday stated that the government would demolish 1,300 illegal structures in Maiduguri. Bababe said that the exercise would be conducted in collaboration between the Agency and Urban Planning and Development Board (UPDB), targeting structures sited on roads, reservations and waterways in Maiduguri and its environs. He attributed perennial flooding in the metropolis to poor planning of structures, adding that such illegal structures were erected on river banks and waterways. “We are waiting for approval from the state governor to enable the relevant agencies to swing into action. “Over 1, 300 houses and structures are marked for demolition, if we allow it; flood water will submerge the city and expose the residents to risks. “Those who acquired illegal lands and built on it should know that the consequence is demolition without compensation,” he said Bababe said that the Agency was established in 2019 to address challenges in land administration which had been in shambles due to racketeering being perpetrated by individuals and agents. He noted the town planning was developed in 1976 would be reviewed to meet the standard of modern society. The Manager said the Agency had introduced digitalisation of the land records and introduced e-payment for ground rents, to facilitate payment into the Single Treasury Account (TSA). He said the Agency also conducted awareness creation activities to sensitise residents of the state.
