COMMERCIAL drivers in Anambra State have lamented alleged extortion and harassment by illegal revenue collectors. They alleged extortion of fees from N7,500 to N2,300, and physical assault. Bus driver Ejike Ibemezie said: “Each transporter plying different routes pays N7,500 to different groups in the morning; in the afternoon, they pay N850, while they pay N2,300 in the evening. The amount reduces on Sundays. “If government wants money from us it should make the process more formal.” A tricycle operator, Uzochukwu Ifeatu, who plys Nkpor-main market, Onitsha, said: “The worst is that they fight us when we don’t have money to pay. You can see the injuries I sustained during one of such fights. Sometimes, our vehicles are damaged in the process. Chairman of the Road Transport Employees Association of Nigeria (RTEAN) Kingsley Maduagwuna urged the government to deploy security agencies and task force officials. He said: “Over the years, our association, which has the government’s backing, was sabotaged by hoodlums and our opponents, who were only interested in filling their pockets. “Having cleared such obstacles on our way, and with the nod of government to operate, we shall use the instrumentality of RTEAN to boost the state revenue profile because the hoodlums, who should siphon money that should go to the state, are on the run…” Commissioner for Transport Afam Mbanefo described the activities of hoodlums as worrisome to the government and people. He promised that steps were being taken to rid the state of hoodlums.
