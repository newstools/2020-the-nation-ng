Kano Governor and Chairman of the Edo State Gubernatorial Campaign Council for All Progressives Congress (APC) Abdullahi Ganduje has congratulated new Edo Speaker Victor Edoror. His Chief Press Secretary (CPS), Abba Anwar, said the Governor also congratulated all the newly elected principal officers. Ganduje said with the new leadership in the Assembly “proper legislative work would soon start to put the state on the right path.” According to him: “The new Edo Speaker’s election by the needed and constitutionally accepted number of the state legislators is a welcome development. “It is therefore, pertinent for us to congratulate him alongside other principal officers of the House.” Ganduje considers Edoror’s emergence as good omen for the APC ahead of official flag off of its campaign for Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu. Edoror’s emergence, he said, “is something that has eluded the State Assembly for over 13 months. And it has been practicalised just yesterday. What a constitutional reinstatement of the House leadership.” The Governor urged the new Assembly leaders to work and act in accordance with the laid down rules and regulations, unlike what is obtained in the Edo state executive. “Your constitutionally accepted election is an important signal that your actions will continue to be guided by constitutional provisions,” the Kano governor stated.
