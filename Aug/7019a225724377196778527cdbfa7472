Bayern Munich inflicted a 8-2 humiliation on Barcelona in one of the most sensational games in Champions League knockout history. The Bavarians were 4-1 up at half-time through goals from Thomas Muller (2), Ivan Perisic and Serge Gnabry. And they continued to embarrass the opposition in the second half, with Joshua Kimmich, Robert Lewandowski and Philippe Coutinho (2), on loan from Barcelona, getting in on the act as Bayern ran riot in Lisbon. Barcelona found Bayern Munich too much of a mountain to climb as captain Lionel Messi could not galvanise the team even after David Alaba netted an own goal and Luis Suarez netted the second for Barcelona. Muller put Bayern a goal up after just four minutes following a brilliant one-two with Robert Lewandowski, but Barca were level three minutes later thanks to a comical David Alaba own goal. But that setback only seemed to spur Bayern on as the Bundesliga champions hit three without reply as Ivan Perisic put Bayern back in front and with Barcelona’s defence creaking, they were punished again on 27 minutes when the German champions executed a stunning team move. To add insult to injury, Coutinho – who is still owned by Barcelona – comes on to replace Gnabry and scored two against own team to take the tally to eight. Bayern will face the winners of Saturday’s Man City and Lyon in the semi-finals.
