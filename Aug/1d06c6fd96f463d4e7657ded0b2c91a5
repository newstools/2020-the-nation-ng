The Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) will on Monday unveil Gboye Adegbenro as the running mate to its governorship candidate, Agboola Ajayi. The state Chairman of ZLP, Mr. Joseph Akinlaja, last night confirmed Adegbenro as the party’s choice for a running mate. He said Adegbenro will be announced on Monday. Former Commissioner for Youths and Sports Yekini Olanipekun has, however, denied eyeing the ZLP governorship ticket. He said he was not a member of ZLP and never sought to run on the party’s platform. Olanipekun said: “I’m not part of ZLP. I didn’t lobby and never discussed with anybody that I wanted to be running mate on ZLP’s platform.”
