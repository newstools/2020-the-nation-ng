 Managing Director, Rotimax Pest Control Training Academy, Rotimi Tolulope Caleb has said that since the onset of Covid-19 in Nigeria, his Institute as well as company, Rotimax Integrated Services has recorded a 60 per cent increase in patronage. He spoke while rendering a two days training on professional pest control and disinfection services to a group of 20 at his Omole office. The reason for the patronage, he said, is as a result of Covid-19 induced fears. “We train 20 people at a time to observe the social distance rule but we stretch the trainings to accommodate others that are interested.” Caleb said his institute’s curriculum did not use to have a lot on disinfection but because of the Covid-19 it is now top most in the curriculum as a lot of people who are not professionals have started to render the services. “There is a difference between fumigation and disinfection. Disinfection is going after viruses while fumigation is going after pests and we need to let people know how to go after viruses because unlike pests, you cannot see viruses or bacteria with your eyes and people must know that after carrying out disinfection services, they must as well disk fact themselves so as not to go about with the virus,” he said.
