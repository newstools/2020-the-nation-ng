All Progressives Congress (APC) in Akwa Ibom State has reacted to last Friday’s report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), which placed Akwa Ibom second on the unemployment index. The party said the report was a true reflection of the state’s socio-economic situation under the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) administration of Governor Udom Emmanuel. It alleged mismanagement of state revenue and resources by the government was responsible for the ‘miserable socio-economic status’. A statement by the spokesman, Nkereuwem Enyongekere, said: “The people have just been reminded … that their state has the second highest unemployment rate in the country… 45.2 per cent, translating to 1.14 million people. “The underemployed population…is about 551,000, while underemployment rate and unemployment rate is 66.9 per cent. This is the most embarrassing and depressing economic data… in the state’s 33-year history… and coming at a time we are the highest earner of oil revenue… “… Akwa Ibom has the second highest HIV/AIDS prevalence and is sliding down … in WASSCE and other external examinations. “When Udom Emmanuel took over as governor in 2015, we were the 12th position in WASSCE performance. Last year, we fell to the 17th position…’’ But Commissioner for Information and Strategy Iniobong Ememobong said APC’s reasoning was ‘skewed’, insisting the report was not reflective of the socio-economic situation under Emmanuel. “The reality …of the existence and operation of the industries in our state, recruitment into the civil and public service, Public Private Partnership initiatives, award of direct labour contracts, our airline and general aviation businesses, qualitative cash support and interest free loans to entrepreneurs, financial and input support to farmers; the obvious conclusion will confirm that indeed the current administration has created quality jobs …” he said.
