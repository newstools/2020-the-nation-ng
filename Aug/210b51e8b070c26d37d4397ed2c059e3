On Day 37, 14 Housemates won N4 million. The task for the day had the remaining 14 Housemates cook noodles with special spices and make a cultural presentation of their prepared meals. The Housemates were grouped into seven teams – a male and female housemate per team – and were given different special spices to make different tastes of the noodles. The seven teams Team One: Kiddwaya, and Wathoni Team Two: Neo and Erica Team Three: Lucy and Ozo Team Four: Tolanibaj and Trikytee Team Five: Prince, and Nengi Team Six: Dorathy, and Laycon Team Seven: Vee and Bright O The cooking Each pair was asked to exchange their special ingredients with partners and cook using the ingredients exchanged. Batch by batch they entered the kitchen to make their meals. Each batch made up of two pairs of Housemates had 30 minutes to make their meals and they hurried to make sure their meals were ready before the buzzer went off. The cultural presentation Dressed in their native attires, the housemates made their way to the arena batch by batch to present the dishes they made. First, they had to taste each other’s meals then share their culture and the recipe for the meal. They had 5 minutes to showcase their culture then score each other on how well they thought the meals represented their culture.
