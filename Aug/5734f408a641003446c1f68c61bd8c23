MTN said small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are very critical to the survival of the economy, adding that it is committed to supporting its growth to enhance job creation and gross domestic product (GDP). As a demonstration of this, it has started The RevvProgramme, which it believes would mitigate against the effects of COVID-19 on SMEs in line with the digital economy drive of the government as espoused in the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS) linked to empowering SMEs as an avenue for the diversification of the economy. Speaking at the virtual launch of the programme, the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Patanmi commended the telco for supporting the digital economy drive of the country. He said: “As stakeholders in the public and private sectors, it is our collective responsibility to implement the digital economy initiative of the government. I am glad that MTN has been supportive of this policy and is organising The RevvProgramme, which I believe, will go a long way in transforming Nigerian entrepreneurs, most especially those in the Micro and Small Medium Enterprise (MSME) sector.” The Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment Adeniyi Adebayo said there is a nexus between his ministry’s efforts in developing the MSME space and MTN’s The RevvProgramme.
