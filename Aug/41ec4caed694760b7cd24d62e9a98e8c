The Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) has said it had suspended its planned withdrawal of petroleum tanker drivers from Lagos State. Its National President, Williams Akporeha, announced this in a text message to The Nation. He said the oil workers decided to suspend the action after the intervention of the officials of the state government. At the weekend, the union directed petroleum tanker drivers to withdraw from the state with effect from yesterday over alleged failure of relevant authorities to address their concerns about bad roads, extortion by security agencies and street urchins, among others. “Strike (has been) suspended after engagement and resolution reached with Lagos State government,” Akporeha’s said in the terse text message.
