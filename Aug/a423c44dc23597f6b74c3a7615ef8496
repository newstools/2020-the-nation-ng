Wema Bank Plc is supporting women entrepreneurs with free virtual training sessions on business growth and sustainability. The first of these sessions focused on helping professional and businesswomen “restructure their business, career and finances for the future”. A virtual webinar tagged “Juggling Home Schooling & Work”, was  designed to cater to the women with children who were working from home amid the pandemic. In partnership with Wise Planner Consulting, Sara By Wema selected women through a competition on its Instagram page @sarabywema and other online platform for a webinar themed “Business Growth”. To help women with online stores generate more sales on Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, Sara by Wema partnered Divigate360 for the “Boost With Facebook” event. The three-day training had over 200 participants via Zoom. Divided into two daily sessions, the webinar enlightened female entrepreneurs on how the digital space could affect their business positively and how to use Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram to grow their business. Executive Director (ED), Business Support, Wema Bank, Mrs Folake Sanu  said: “In times like this, growing your business may seem difficult, however consistency, restructuring and re-strategising your business are ways to thrive as an entrepreneur.” Sara by Wema has also organised  training for several women associations.  It plans to ensure that women are equipped with skills to help them thrive in their endeavours.
