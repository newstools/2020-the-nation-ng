 NIGERIA Football Federation (NFF) is on the process to retire the   number six  jersey in honour of  late former Nigerian international  Samuel Okwaraji. Okwaraji slumped and died  while on duty in a 1990 World Cup Qualifier against Angola at the National Stadium in Lagos on August 12, 1989. Speaking yesterday  on the occasion of  the 31 years  anniversary of  Okwaraji’s death, NFF President Amaju Pinnick has assured that he will pursue the implementation of the proposal made to retire the number six jersey worn  by the  ace midfielder. “Coincidentally I was right there at the National Stadium, Lagos on that fatefully day it was a game against Angola; the match was tensed and my late brother, Patrick Okpomo was the Secretary General of the then NFA so I was privileged to be there,” Pinnick said on a radio programme.  “Somebody made that proposal to us earlier in the year about retiring that shirt and I think it will not be too much for us to do that. “I think I will now forward the proposal to my executive committee for us to implement the retiring of the shirt because it has been said already. “
