Main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has accused the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and Federal Government officials of nepotism in the allocation of the 774,000 public works jobs in all the local governments. In a statement on Monday in Abuja by its spokesman Kola Ologbondiyan, the PDP said: “While our party is not against the creation of job opportunities to Nigerians, we reject this crafty political allocation, which is a direct exclusion of hardworking Nigerians from opportunities that should have been open to them under an open and transparent process. “The PDP notes that since the funding for the jobs is drawn from the national purse, the process should be completely apolitical in a manner that grants unrestrictive opportunity to all Nigerians, irrespective of political affiliation, ethnicity or creed. “The PDP rejects a situation where, in each local government area, 800 slots of the 1,000 jobs have already been pencilled off to political cronies while the remaining 200 openings are thrown open for contest to the public, which also include politically affiliated persons.” “Such brash violation of the principle of fairness and equal opportunity by the APC and its administration is a direct invitation to restiveness and acrimony in the country; as such, should be immediately rescinded in the national interest. “Already, there is a growing uneasiness and restiveness among Nigerians who would definitely be denied opportunity to participate in this national process. “This is especially, given allegations already in the public space that the resort to political allocation of jobs is designed by selfish APC leaders to corner the opportunities for selfish pecuniary reasons. “Consequently, our party charges the Federal Government to rescind the resort to political allocation and only engage Nigerians through an open, transparent and all-inclusive process in the allocation of the 774,000 jobs.”
