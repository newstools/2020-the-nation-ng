The Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, on Thursday assured that the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) will be presented to the National Assembly in the next few weeks. Sylva said the executive arm would be requesting the lawmakers to specially reconvene to receive and begin deliberations on the bill. According to him, the bill is key to repositioning of Nigeria’s oil and gas industry under its post COVID-19 agenda. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the minister spoke during a webinar organised by the Nigerian Association of Petroleum Explorationists (NAPE) with the theme: “Fiscal Regime Design, Government Revenues and Investors’ Interest in Nigeria Oil and Gas Sector. “In the coming few days, we will be requesting the National Assembly to specially reconvene to look at the PIB, which may as well take some weeks before its passage,” Sylva said.
