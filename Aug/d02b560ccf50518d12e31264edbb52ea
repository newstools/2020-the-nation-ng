The General Overseer of Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN), Prophet T. B. Joshua, has denied giving any prophecy on the September 19 governorship election. The cleric, who spoke in Lagos on Wednesday, said any such story was “entirely false, a prophecy rumour and propagated by Satan…the father of lies.” SCOAN said in a statement: “Our attention has been drawn to articles circulating on the Internet within Nigeria claiming that Prophet T. B. Joshua has given a prophecy regarding the coming governorship election in Edo State. “This story is entirely false! Prophet T. B. Joshua has not given any prophecy regarding this. “Remember, the Bible says in John 8:44 that Satan is ‘the father of lies’. Don’t listen to the father of lies, the sons of lies and the daughters of lies. Do not sit somewhere, hear this or that and come to a hasty conclusion. “God requires that we find out the truth from Him first and hold fast to that which is true, as the Bible says in 1 Thessalonians 5:21.
