Erica doesn’t seem ready to move on after breaking up with Kiddwaya. She was fuming after Kiddwaya was seen having a long chat with Nengi in the kitchen after the Saturday night party. Erica said she feels disrespected seeing Kidd with Erica. “I saw what you did with Nengi, you have no right be behaving like that. You can say I’m in my feelings but yea I have the rights,” Erica said. Responding reluctantly, Kidd said he doesn’t see anything wrong with what he did. “I’m not apologising, you always see that part of me. I was only teaching her out to flirt with guys,” Kidd told Erica.
