Evicted Housemate Praise has debunked rumors that he is engaged to a 60-year-old woman. While in the House, Bright O claimed Praise is engaged to a lady who is twice older. Bright O said Praise likes older women, which a weakness he would use it against him. But Praise, during a radio interview, said his finance is only 42-year- old and he isn’t ashamed about it. He also stated he never had such a conversation with Bright O so he doesn’t know where he came up with it. “I’ve never had such conversation with Bright O, I no understand where e come from. I know say I don talk too. E get one-time wey Lucy talk say she no go fit follow anybody wey dey younger than her. E cun make me talk say my fiancé dey older than me. I feel say na from there he hear am wey e come talk say na 60years,” he said. “Bright O and Kiddwaya took my jokes seriously and it seems they were pained but I’m so sorry about it,” he added.
