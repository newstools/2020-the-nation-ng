 GENERAL Manager (Corporate Affairs) of the National Inland Waterways Agency (NIWA) Jibril Darda’u has said ongoing reforms in the agency, under the leadership of George Moghalu, would continue unabated. Darda’u gave the assurance at a news conference in Onitsha, Anambra State, following accusations against the agency by the Incorporated Trustees Board of Sand Miners. The miners had accused the agency of violating court order, multiple taxation, obstructing right of way, access fee and vandalism. But Darda’u refuted the allegations, describing them as mere distractions targeted at smearing Moghalu’s image. He maintained that the agency’s activities were covered by the Act guiding it, saying it would not join issues with the sand miners since the matter was still in court. Darda’u said: “NIWA, under Moghalu, is law abiding and would not go contrary to the Act guiding it. The issue is not about Moghalu, but NIWA’s laws which have been in existence before Moghalu came on board, and will continue even after him. “Those using the sand miners to blackmail Moghalu won’t succeed. His commitment to right the wrongs in the agency is unparalleled and won’t be distracted…”
