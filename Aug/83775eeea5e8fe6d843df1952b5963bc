The Nigeria Police Force (NPF) has urged all candidates who successfully completed the online recruitment registration in the current recruitment of constables to go for physical and credential screening between August 24, 2020 and September 6, 2020, across the federation. A statement by the Force Public Relations Officer (FPRO), Frank Mba, a Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), said the applicants are to appear at the screening venues in their clean white T-shirts and shorts. They are expected to carry the following mandatory basic requirements: National Identity Number (NIN); original and duplicate copies of credentials – O’ Level result(s), certificate of origin and birth certificate/declaration of age – neatly arranged in two white flat files with recent passport photographs attached; printout of application submission confirmation page; and a duly completed guarantor’s form.” Mba said any candidate who fails to present any of the above will not be considered for the screening. “The screening will take place at designated locations within each state and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Detailed and specific guidelines for each state will be announced by the Police Public Relations Officers in the 36 states of the federation and the FCT. The screening and other activities touching on the recruitment exercise will be carried out in strict compliance with the COVID-19 prevention protocols. “Inspector General of Police (IGP) Mohammed Abubakar Adamu reiterates that the recruitment is absolutely free of charge and without any pecuniary obligation. The IGP assures that the process will be conducted in the best tradition of transparency and accountability.”
