Seven-time Olympian Segun Toriola has signed for  Belgian side P.W. Diesta in the Belgium elite table tennis league after 15 years’ stint  in the French league. Toriola who narrowly missed out from setting a new world record as the first table tennis player to compete in eight Olympic Games, had spent the last one decade competing for Bayard Argentan in second division. “I moved to Belgium because the COVID-19 is very serious in France and many clubs lost their sponsors and I don’t have a choice but to move to Belgium,” explained Toriola. “Unfortunately, my club, Bayard Argentan didn’t have enough funds to pay players. “Initially I accepted to stay with the club but when I got a better offer in Belgium and that is why I decided to move to Belgium for the 2020/2021 season.” The 45-year-old , said he would continue to play as long as he is fit: “For how long do I still want to be a professional? For now I don’t know it depends on how my body is going to take it; you know table tennis is a sport I really like and I have passion for . “ I know age is not on my side, but for now I don’t know when I am going to stop.”
