The Police in Delta have confirmed the arrest of a 30-year-old man identified as Jomaph who allegedly raped an 11-year-old girl in Sapele town, Sapele LGA of Delta. Spokesperson of the Delta Police Command, DSP Onome Onovwakpoyeya, told newsmen on Wednesday in Asaba that the suspect was arrested after he was captured on a CCTV camera sneaking into the toilet to meet the victim. “The young man was arrest after he was captured on a nearby CCTV sneaking into the toilet with the little girl. “The suspect has been arrested and the case is currently under investigation. “After preliminary investigation, the case will be transferred to the State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID), Asaba,” Onovwakpoyeya said. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), however, gathered that the incident occurred at about 7am on Wednesday, Aug. 12, on Oleh road in Sapele. The victim was reported to have gone to use the toilet, but returned minutes later crying that she had been raped by Jomaph, who is a neighbour to the victim’s family. A community source told NAN that when Jomaph was accosted over the allegation he denied raping the little girl. “When we questioned him over the allegation, he denied, he even swore that he had not set his eyes on the girl that morning. “Other neighbours pleaded with him to say the truth, but he maintained his stance that he never raped the girl. “Jomaph even went ahead to report the girl and her parents to the police for defamation of character. “However, a CCTV camera installed by a neighbour for his business, later showed the moment Jomaph sneaked into the toilet immediately after the girl had gone to use the toilet,” the source said.
