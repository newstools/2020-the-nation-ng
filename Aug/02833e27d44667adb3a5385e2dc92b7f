The Acting Director of Defence Information praised Kogi Government for its commitment to security of lives and property. Replying, Fanwo thanked the Armed Forces for contributing “immensely to re-writing the security story of Kogi State”. He said: “Let me use this opportunity to, on behalf of the Governor and the good people of Kogi State, thank the Armed Forces for supporting the Kogi State Government to defeat criminality in the state. “When the Governor came in 2016, Kogi was almost lost to crimes and terror. But today, the Governor has rejigged the security architecture to a capacity capable of defeating the criminals. The success was largely due to the support of the Armed Forces. “With the right information, our nation can defeat terror and criminality. We will work with you to achieve that.” The highlight of the visit was presentation of the Defence Magazine to the Commissioner for Information by Brig. General Onyema Nwachukwu.
