Following their agreement to remain platonic friends on Friday, ex- Head of House Erica has said that she got tired of her relationship with Kidd due to his constant talks about sex. Erica and Kiddwaya, earlier in the day, had agreed to remain platonic friends after she demanded to know her position in Kidd’s life. She had accused Kiddwaya of not respecting her in the presence of other Housemates and not reciprocating her love. However, while discussing with Neo and Bright O, she said she got hired of Kidd because he only talks about kisses and sex. “I’m bored with all the sex talks Kiddwaya brings. I’m bored. I’m bored. “All he talks about is ‘I want to kiss you, kiss your neck, have sex with you. I’m bored. “Okay, he actually feels he can do anything he wants. I don’t have to accept it. I have accepted a lot of rubbish things from him. I know what I deserve. I’m bored with all the sex talks.”
