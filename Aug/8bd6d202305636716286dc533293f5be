The Federal Government has filed an amended 14-count money laundering charge against former Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Justice Minister Mohammed Bello Adoke as well as a businessman, Aliyu Abubakar. The amended charge replaced an earlier seven-count charge on which Adoke and Abubakar were arraigned before Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja, on June 17 this year. Both defendants were re-arraigned on Tuesday on the amended charge before the same judge and they pleaded not guilty to them. Justice Ekwo adjourned till August 11 for the prosecution to open its case by calling its first set of witnesses. In the old charge, six counts were directed at Adoke, while only one was directed at Abubakar. But in the amended one, seven counts are directed at each of the defendants.
