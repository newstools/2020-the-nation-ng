Raul Jimenez has been linked with a move to Manchester United – but how much does the Wolves striker earn? According to Vital Football, Jimenez takes home an annual salary of £2.1million. That works out as approximately £175,000 per month, or a weekly wage of £40,000. Wolves signed Jimenez on a permanent basis in 2019 for a club record £30million. He said at the time: “I want to make history here at the club. “I want to put the club back into the top places in the Premier League. I think we all want that and have that ambition.  “It’s a great honour for me to now be a permanent member of the team.” With reports linking Jimenez to United beginning to escalate, fans have taken to social media to share their reactions. One wrote on Twitter: “Raúl Jiménez would be a fantastic signing! 17 goals and 6 assists for Wolves this season. “A proven goalscorer and a different type of striker to Martial – it’s a Yes from me!” Another wrote: “You have to admit, Raul Jimenez is a great CF and a great signing if United seal it. “He can play in multiple systems as well.” A third commented: “Raul Jimenez is 29 years old, wouldn’t fit in with how Solskjaer wants his team to play and Wolves would want to sell for around £50-60 million. That’s all I have to say.”
