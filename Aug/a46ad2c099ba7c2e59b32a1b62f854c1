Joe Hart has completed his shock move to Tottenham as cover for goalkeeper Hugo Lloris. The former England international underwent medical tests on Monday and has signed a two-year contract on around £50,000 a week as Jose Mourinho adds experience to his squad. Hart was set to seal his switch to the capital today, which the 33-year-old hinting the move was imminent as he wrote ‘big day’ in an Instagram story. Hart has been training intensively on his own since leaving Burnley at the end of June and has been on the list of numerous clubs but a move to Premier League Tottenham has come as a surprise to many. He has been discussed by Celtic, Leeds United, Blackburn Rovers and Derby County and had also considered options abroad, notably from Turkey. Tottenham want to increase competition for Lloris who has endured injuries and lapses in form over recent seasons and a free transfer such as Hart works for Mourinho under a restricted budget whilst also boosting their homegrown quota. The Tottenham boss also has Paulo Gazzaniga as back-up. Hart has 75 England caps and made 24 appearances for Burnley over two years. He lost his place to Tom Heaton midway through the first season of a two year contract and then spent the 2019-20 campaign covering for the in-form Nick Pope.
