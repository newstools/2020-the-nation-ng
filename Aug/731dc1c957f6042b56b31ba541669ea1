Factional President of Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN), Ibrahim Gusau, has described his reported removal as Chairman, Zamfara State Athletics Association as illegal. It would be recalled that a statement was issued by the George Olamide faction of the AFN on Monday on the dismissal of Gusau with likely automatically disqualification from the AFN board. However, a miffed Gusau said: “I wish to put it on record that the position of the Chairman of Zamfara State Athletics Association was by election and not by appointment and the neither the Director of Sports, Directorate of Sports Development, Zamfara State nor its Management has the powers to remove an elected Chairman from office. “In fact, as the President of AFN, I can categorically state that the Zamfara Association currently has neither constitution nor law that authorized it to sit and remove any elected member of the Association from Office.” In a statement issued and signed by Gusau, he described his sack as fake news, warning the public to disregard the news. He added: Much as the author of the fake news may be ignorant of the extant laws and guidelines regulating the election of a person into the office of the President of the AFN and removal from office, I do not expect him to be ignorant of the recent judgment of the Federal High Court which re-affirmed me as the President of the AFN as well as the Court’s declaration of the supremacy of the Constitution of the AFN with respect to the modus operandi of the AFN.”
