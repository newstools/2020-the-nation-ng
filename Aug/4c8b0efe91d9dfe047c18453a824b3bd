Director-General of Chief Olusola Oke campaign Organisation Barrister Olarenwaju Kazeem has defected to the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP). Oke was first runner up at the governorship primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) won by Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu. Olarenwaju joined ZLP at his country home at Ikare Akoko alongside his supporters across the 18 local government areas of Ondo State. He said he dumped the APC because the party allegedly embarked on anti- peopleâ€™s policies as well as subjected the masses into abject poverty. The former Chief Oke DG urged the people Ondo residents to vote wisely in the coming election. He said Hon Agboola Ajayi was the only alternative and solution to the bad and dysfunctional government.
