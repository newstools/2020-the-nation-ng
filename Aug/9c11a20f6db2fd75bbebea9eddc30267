The Federal Government has approved N13.3 billion for take-off of Community Policing initiative. This was contained in a report submitted to the National Economic Council (NEC) presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Thursday. The report was submitted by the NEC’s ad-hoc committee on Security and Policing chaired by Ekiti Governor Kayode Fayemi. Disclosing the outcomes of the virtual meeting to State House Correspondents, Nasarawa Governor Abdulahi Sule, said the ad-hoc committee met on August 4 to review the escalating security challenges in the country. According to him, there were briefings and presentations from the National Security Adviser (NSA), Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Chief of Defense Staff and the Department of State Services (DSS). “Council resolved that the Chair of the NGF (Nigeria Governors’ Forum) with two other governors would be meeting with the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, the Finance Minister and the Inspector-General of Police to co-ordinate the proper utilization of the funding of community policing in the states. The federal government has already approved N13billion for this same purpose.” He said the meeting also observed the Office of the NSA has not been adequately funded in the last five years to enable it carry out its mandate effectively. “State governments have been overwhelmed by insecurity expenditures and there is therefore the need by the Federal Government to inject more funds to augment expenses by the states, amongst others,” he stated.
