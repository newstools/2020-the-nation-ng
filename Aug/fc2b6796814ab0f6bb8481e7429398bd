Abia State Governor Okezie Ikpeazu has relieved the Commissioner of Transport, Ekele Nwaohammuo, of his duties. Transition Committee Chairmen of Aba North (Victor Ubani); Aba South (Cherechi Wogu) and Umunneochi (Mathew Ibe) were also sacked. General Manager of Traffic and Indiscipline Management Agency of Abia State (TIMAAS) Bright Ikeokwu was also relived of his duties. A statement yesterday by Ikpeazu’s Chief of Staff, Anthony Agbazuere, gave no reason for their sack. But sources said the sacks could not be unconnected to gross-misconducts and anti-party activities of those concerned. The governor also approved the appointment of Ezechikamnayo as Transition Committee Chairman Nominee for Umuneochi, while Tony Nwanmuo and  Godswill Nwonoruo have been sent to the House of Assembly as Commissioner-nominees. The statement reads: “…the deputy chairmen of the affected councils should take over and, together with their Heads of Service, set up a taskforce to check environmental indiscipline and other vices. “TIMASS taskforce is also to be set up to further check these excesses.”
