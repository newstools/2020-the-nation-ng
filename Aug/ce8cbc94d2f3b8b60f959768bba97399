New Napoli signing Victor Osimhen has opened up about his time at German Bundesliga side Wolfsburg. The forward signed for the Parthenopeans last month in a club-record fee of €70 million which could rise to €80 million with bonuses, to become Nigeria’s most expensive player. The young striker, however, endured a testing time at his first European club Wolfsburg which he joined following his eye-catching performances at the 2015 U17 World Cup in Chile. The 21-year-old forward starred at the tournament, winning the Golden Boot and Silver Ball awards after helping Nigeria clinch the title. Osimhen made 12 league appearances for the club but didn’t score a goal. The forward feels Wolves did not give him the needed support but also revealed other challenges he encountered that limited his productivity. “The weather, the language, the food [affected me]. It was my first time in Europe, I was just 18-years-old and I didn’t have enough time to acclimatize. They didn’t believe in me very much,” Osimhen told Sport1. Wolfsburg managing director Jorg Schmadtke admitted the club was not patient with the Super Eagles striker. “The most important lesson is that you have to be patient with some transfers. You can’t say: We’ll sign you up, provide board and lodging, and then it’ll work. The importance of patience is sometimes underestimated,” Schmadtke told Sportbuzzer.
