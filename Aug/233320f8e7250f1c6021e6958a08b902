 The Super Eagles will resume their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaign  with a double header against Sierra Leone in November, while their campaign to qualify for the 2022 World Cup qualifying will begin in May 2021. The AFCON qualifiers were suspended in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic but the Confederation of African Football (CAF) has announced a new resumption date for the remaining matches. The AFCON to be hosted by Cameroon has been moved for a year and will now take place in 2022. In a communiqué signed by CAF’s Acting General Secretary Abdelmounaim Bah, the third and fourth round of 2021 AFCON qualifiers previously scheduled for March will now take place between November 9-17 with the fifth and final round scheduled for March 22-30. The Super Eagles with six points currently sit atop of Group L having won their first two qualifiers against Benin Republic and Lesotho last year. Gernot Rohr’s men will host Sierra Leone in the November internal window and travel to Freetown almost immediately for the return leg  before rounding up against the Squirrels of Benin and Crocodiles of Lesotho. Meanwhile, the Qatar 2022 World Cup qualifiers initially scheduled to start in November will now kick-off in May 2021 and end in October 2021 while the Playoff matches have been scheduled for 8-16 November 2021. Nigeria has been drawn in a group that includes Cape Verde, Central African Republic and Liberia.
