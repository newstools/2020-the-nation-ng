Enterprise Governance of Information Technology is central to organisation’s structure because it enables business and IT people to execute their responsibilities, while maximising the value created from IT-enabled investments, enterprise governance firm, Edniesal Consulting Limited, said at the weekend. Its Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Abiola Laseinde, who spoke in Lagos while unveiling the maiden edition of the Chief Information Officer (CIO) Awards said CIOs are responsible for delivering top-of-the-line innovation and business value within their organisations while at the forefront of decision making and strategic change. He said enterprise governance of IT is a relatively new concept that is gaining traction in both the academic and practitioner worlds. “Going well beyond the implementation of a superior IT infrastructure, enterprise governance of information technology is about defining and embedding processes and structures throughout the organisations that enable both business and IT people to execute their responsibilities, while maximising the value created from their IT-enabled investments. So many players are demonstrating this value and Edniesal Consulting has chosen to recognise and celebrate them,” he said. According to him, the CIOs are hardly seen nor celebrated in most organisations, but now their role has increased in importance as they evolve from information to innovation and leading the digital transformation initiatives.
