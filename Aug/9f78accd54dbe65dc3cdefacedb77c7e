Tottenham are ready to listen to offers for right-back Serge Aurier amid interest from AC Milan, claims Gianluca Di Marzio. Aurier has reportedly told the Serie A giants he wants to join them this summer and now Milan are looking to find an agreement with Tottenham. Milan must first sell one of Davide Calabria or Andrea Conti to accommodate room for the Ivorian international but discussions with Tottenham have started. The 27-year-old was a regular under Jose Mourinho but the Tottenham boss is ready to sell as part of his defensive shake-up. With Kyle Walker-Peters also set to leave Tottenham on a permanent basis this summer the north London outfit will have to sign at least one new right-back for next season. Tottenham are holding out for â‚¬20m for the Ivorian international but Milan are hoping to pay much less.
