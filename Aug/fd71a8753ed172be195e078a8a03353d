 THE National Assembly has been urged to begin the amendment of the Electoral Act to deal with the issue of prolonged litigation of pre-election matters. The call was made at a webinar organised by the Centre for Peace and Development (CEPAD) of Veritas University, Abuja in partnership with Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung West Africa. The webinar had as its theme: “When the court casts the final vote: examining the implications of election litigations in Nigeria’s emerging democracy-2019 in focus.” Participants said the Independent National Electoral Commission should be given administrative adjudication powers on those matters with a definite time frame for resolution of such disputes. They also agreed that the amendment to the electoral Act should include electronic transmission of results from the polling units and other provisions whose inadequacies have been exposed by the interpretations and pronouncements of the court. In a communique issued at the end of the second roundtable discussion and signed by the Director of CEPAD, Dr Innocent Jooji, the experts also called for the creation of special election tribunals to oversee petitions arising from the conduct of elections in the country..
