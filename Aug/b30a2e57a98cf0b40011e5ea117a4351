Residents of Ondo State on Saturday came out to vote in the local government elections across the 203 wards in the state. Seven political parties participated in the local elections. This is the first local elections since Governor Akeredolu came to power in 2016. There were reports of low supply of electoral materials in some units because of huge turnout of voters. In Unit 19 Ward 4, women and youths protested snatching of ballot boxes. The women and youths who said they voted for the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in the ward said they were shocked when thugs on motor-cycle stormed the polling unit and carted away the ballot papers. Ward 4 Woman Leader of SDP, Bisi Aderemi, said she was bribed with N30, 000 but she refused because she wanted the SDP councillorship candidate, Kehinde Joseph, to win the election.
