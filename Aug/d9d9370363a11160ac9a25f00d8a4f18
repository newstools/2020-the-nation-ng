Laycon, Praise and Kiddwaya got into a heated argument over Praise’s expensive jokes. Laycon had confronted Praise over his incessant attitude of making jokes at the expense of others backed by Kiddwaya. Kidd, who also shares the opinion, backed Laycon saying Praise does it too often. But Praise said it wasn’t always serious as they took it but just “cruise”. Arguing further, Praise called Kiddwaya a tyrant who should never be Head of House again. He said: “Kiddwaya should never be allowed to be the Head of house again. He is a tyrant. “When he was supposed to declare the freeze during the Betway trivia games, he made sure he sat down before saying it.”
