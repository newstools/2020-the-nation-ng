 THE University of Nigeria, Nsukka has taken the fight against COVID-19 to a new level by launching a contactless digital hand cleaning machine that uses censor to monitor body temperature, dispenses hand sanitiser, detergent and water. Inspecting the equipment produced by the institution’s Faculty of Engineering, the Vice-Chancellor, Prof Charles Igwe, said the machine was an improvement over the manual hand cleaning machine that dispenses detergent and water. “This machine is different from what we have seen before. It performs four functions at a time without the user making any physical contact,” the vice-chancellor, who was visibly elated, said after using the machine to clean his hand and measure his temperature.
