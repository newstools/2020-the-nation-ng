BBNaija Lockdown Housemates, Vee and Wathoni, recently gave viewers and fans a drama to talk about after their fight over bed space. On their 16th day in the House, Vee and Wathoni ignored their manners and threw caution into the air over bed space and arrangements. Vee had attacked Wathoni for not following her procedures to keep the bed space and arrangement. The mettle Wathoni won’t let this slide as she took on Vee to reciprocate to the best of her ability. Both Housemates were shouting as they exchanged expletives over the bed spaces and arrangements. Those who share the same room with the warring Housemates, tried to calm their nerves. Earlier in the show, Wathoni had recoiled into her shell after she got into a fight with Ka3na. The two had gone at each other but Ka3na wouldn’t let her have her way which got at her until the exit of Ka3na on Sunday, August 2.
