 KWARA State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRasaq on Tuesday promised a special compensation for COVID-19 frontline health workers at the end of the pandemic. AbdulRasaq said this in Ilorin when he visited the workers at the COVID-19 Infectious Disease Centre in the state. The governor said what the workers were receiving from government were allowances, adding that the frontline health workers needed to be handsomely rewarded. This, he said, was because they had volunteered to help the state in combatting the pandemic long before the introduction of allowance. “Our coming here today is to specially and specifically appreciate you for your untiring efforts at ending the pandemic. “We wish to state that we will compensate you specially when the COVID is over,” he said.   .
