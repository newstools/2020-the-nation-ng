Former Head of House Erica has disclosed she chose to be with Kiddwaya instead of Laycon because she had no options. The London- trained actress made this known while speaking with Kiddway on Thursday morning. Erica said since they would be in the House for long, she needed to pick someone and the only person that interests her is Kiddwaya. According to her, there would be several options outside the House unlike inside. “I’m settling with you right now because I don’t have options,” she told Kidd. “There’s no choice right now, so I’m making use of what I have. “You are a 10 in hotness and maybe friendship aspect but other aspects you’re 1/10.”
