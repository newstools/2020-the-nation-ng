The Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) has said only 20 Local Governments in the country are responsible for the current total cases of coronavirus infection in the country. NGF’s Chairman, Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State made this known on Thursday, while briefing on the 15th teleconference meeting of the forum which held on Wednesday. According to a communiqué issued at the end of the meeting, Fayemi was said to have told the meeting that “data from COVID-19 tests conducted in the country show that 20 local government areas in the country account for 50 percent of the COVID-19 cases recorded. “In the light of this, all state governments will be required to scale up risk communications campaigns in these areas through state and local structures.” The meeting then resolved to “scale up the implementation of the Risk Communications Community Engagement (RCCE) strategy developed by the Presidential Task on COVID-19. “The strategy will provide necessary impetus on communicating with the public so that communities can curtail the spread of COVID-19 in a sustainable approach. “State governments will also be able to identify and engage with all the relevant multi-sectoral partners as the success of this strategy. “Commissioners of information are to head this exercise nationwide.”
