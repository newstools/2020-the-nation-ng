Teachers in Ondo State, under the auspices of the National Network of Teachers for Good Governance and Quality Education, have endorsed Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu for a second term. They spoke on Tuesday in Akure during a visit to Chief Alex Ajipe, the convener of Ibi Gíga Ambassadors, a group working for Akeredolu’s re-election. The group Chairman, Mr. Fadeni Tolulope, said Akeredolu’s achievements in the last three years surpassed those of his predecessors that spent eight years in office. He said the governor upgraded infrastructure in schools, attended to teachers’ welfare and embarked on training and re-training of teachers. “We want to thank the governor for the achievement recorded so far in the education sector. “The payment of our salaries and renovation of public schools are part of this government’s achievements. That was why we endorsed him for another term. We believe he can do more,” Fadeni said. He hailed Akeredolu’s leadership style and urged their members to work for his re-election. Ajipe appreciated the teachers’ support and assured them of Akeredolu’s service to humanity. “If Akeredolu is re-elected, it will be another season of reaping the dividends of democracy,” he said. Ajipe advised the people to make love and unity their watchword before, during and after the October 10 governorship election.
