 PLATEAU State Governor Simon Lalong has sworn in the Deputy Chairman of Qua’an Pan Local Government Area Abdulmalik Haruna as substantive Executive Chairman. This followed the impeachment of the suspended former Chairman Isaac Kwallu by the Legislative Arm. The Nation reports that a 16- man legislative council of Qua’an Pan local Government council impeached, Isaac Kwalu. Among several grounds, the councilors accused the impeached chairman of failure to convene Security Council meetings; refusal to make counterpart contributions to the state University in Bokkos; diversion of council funds and lack of respect for due process in the award of contracts. At a ceremony at the New Government House Little Rayfield-Jos, Governor Lalong said the event was coming in rather unusual circumstances because of the impeachment of the former Chairman by members of the Legislative Arm who had accused him of various acts of misconduct. He also said that the former chairman was earlier suspended by the Plateau State House of Assembly. Given this development and in line with extant laws, he said it become necessary to swear in the former Deputy Chairman, Abdulmalik Haruna to ensure there was no vacuum in the administration of the Local Government administration.
