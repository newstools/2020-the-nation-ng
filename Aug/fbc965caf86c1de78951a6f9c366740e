President Muhmmadu Buhari has described former United States (U.S.) Ambassador Walter Carrington as a “long-time friend of Nigeria, an astute and courageous diplomat.” He mourned the death of the top diplomat in a statement issued by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu. In a tribute last night, President Buhari praised the late ambassador whom he said “openly supported the people of this country when they fought for the return of democracy following the annulment of the June 12, 1993 presidential elections won by the late Moshood Abiola.” President Buhari said the story of the Nigerian democracy under the Fourth Republic will not complete without a mention of the heroic roles of the likes of Ambassador Carrington. The statement said: “On behalf of my family, the government and people of Nigeria, I commiserate with the family of the deceased, his friends and admirers as well as the government and people of the United States.”
