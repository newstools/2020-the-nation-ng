The #RevolutionNow protesters have finally converged on the Berger roundabout in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) asking President Muhammadu Buhari to resign. A member of the #RevolutionNow group, Pelumi Olajengbesin, asked Nigerians to speak against unending killings in the country. The protest held after a combined team of police, army, airforce and some paramilitary personnel were deployed on Wednesday morning to prevent the protest, earlier scheduled for Unity Fountain. Abuja leader of #RevolutionNow, Deji Adeyanju, told our correspondent the police attacked the #RevolutionNow members at the Unity Fountain and arrested them.
