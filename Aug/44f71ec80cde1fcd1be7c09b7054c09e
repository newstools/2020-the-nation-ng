It’s barely 14 hours after Biggie decided to go on a secret vacation with only Head of House, Kiddwaya, in the know. But Neo has started missing Biggie’s voice and presence in the House. Early on Tuesday, August 18, Neo kept shouting “where’s Biggie, can you hear me?” It was during preparation for breakfast and Neo had stood in the middle of the kitchen beside Laycon shouting to the cameras and asking if Biggie could hear him. Neo insisted he was unable to feel Biggie and wondered if all was well. The 26-year-old ride-hailing app driver had tried to always sweet talk Biggie into achieving his aims in the House. On Monday evening, August 17, during his Diary session, Neo had tried persuading Biggie claiming he had an earlier arrangement. He went to tell Biggie how he wanted some flowers and other things to surprise his love interest, Vee since he can’t go out to make her 24th birthday memorable. Biggie had sent the fifth Housemate, Kiddwaya, on a secret mission when he informed him he would be going on a secret vacation for some days. Biggie further stressed no Housemate should hear about his secret vacation.
