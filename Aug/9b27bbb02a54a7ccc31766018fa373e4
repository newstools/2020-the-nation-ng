 DEPUTY Governor Philip Shaibu has urged the electorate to support the re-election of Governor Godwin Obaseki, to move the state forward. He said the current administration was transforming the state and it should be allowed to continue beyond November 12. Shaibu, on Sunday in an online statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media, Benjamin Atu, said another term for Obaseki would allow him to consolidate on his achievements. He said: “We took over a state with dwindling economic fortune for our people. The only way we were able to tackle it was to embark on aggressive efforts in raising entrepreneurs and building entrepreneurial spirit among the people. “As a government, we want the poor in our midst to have access to means of production, turn them into entrepreneurs in their own right, employers of labour and masters of their economic destiny, with the ability to turn the economic fortune of the state around for the better. “We discover that micro-credit will enable us achieve our objectives faster, because it can be used to benefit poor entrepreneurs, as a major fillip to take people out of poverty. This, the government has proved, by micro-credit programmes to bring about sustained development. “The objective of our administration is to achieve the happiness, economic enhancement and independence of the poorest, the weakest, the most vulnerable and the disadvantaged.” The deputy governor said the Obaseki administration had penetrated the grassroots through meeting financial obligations of businesses.
