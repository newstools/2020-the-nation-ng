A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Dr. Jimoh Ibrahim has declared the party dead in Ondo after joining the All Progressives Congress (APC). Ibrahim stated the strategy he used to revive the PDP from death would be deployed to destroy the party in the October 10, governorship election. The business mogul, who spoke when he officially joined the APC at Igbotako, Okitipupa local government area, said the PDP and its candidate, Eyitato Jegede, would lose the election even if they spend all resources at their disposal. He said he joined the APC because of Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu’s giant strides across the state, particularly his efforts at the resuscitation of the Olusegun Agagu University of Science and Technology, which he alleged was abandoned by the Mimiko administration for eight years. According to him: ”I do not want to sound proud but I revived PDP in this state. I know how I revived the party and I am going to use the same strategy to kill the PDP. “I have received the broom from our party chairman here. This night, I will do something. I will give the PDP its poison. I know how I revived the party. I will poison the party to death again. ”I have tried not to talk about the ZLP. I pray we will not suffer in this life. Where is Zenith Labour Party in this state? “The painful thing is that Agboola saw a golden opportunity and missed it to join the train of betrayers. “Let me congratulate you Mr. Governor. You are going to win that election with a wide margin.” Ondo APC chairman, Engr. Ade Adetimehin, who received Ibarahim, said the APC parades an array of leaders of integrity and proven character across the state. He described the decision of Ibrahim to join the APC as one informed by the quality of people.
