A General Court Martial (GCM) sitting in Abuja on Wednesday sentenced a soldier to 55 years imprisonment for murder, burglary and theft. Lance Corporal Ibrahim Babangida killed one Bello Abdullahi Aliyu and also robbed his car at Anka council area of Zamfara State in 2014. Aliyu was then on the staff of the World Health Organisation (WHO) in the state. Babangida also stole a mobile phone and N600,000 from various persons on separate occasions. After listening to prosecution and defence counsels, President of the GMC, Maj. Gen. Priye Fakrogha ruled that the accused will serve a jail term of 40 years for homicide. Babangida was also sentenced to five years on each of three-count charges for which he pleaded guilty, but the sentencing will run concurrently.
