The Nigerian Export Processing Zone Authority (NEPZA) in partnership with Future Africa Technology is set to run the 42 free trade zones in the country on technology and innovations. The Managing Director, NEPZA Adesoji Adesugba said the organization in partnership with Future Africa and others will begin the use of technology and innovation to operate the country’s 42 free trade zones in the country. He lauded Future Africa for providing capital, coaching and innovations to drive the project. Both organizations are prepared to jointly deploy technology to spark up interests and participation in the country’s free trade zones scheme. Adesugba said technology remained the quickest accelerator of modern business in Africa, adding that the training of the youth to redirect their psychic to exploit the systems more positively is important. “Nigerian youths remain the technology talent hub that we can leverage on to create the wealth for our nation. “We have a dream of being at the forefront of the industrialization of Nigeria. The free trade zones are supposed to be the foreign countries in our country that relentlessly promote industrialization through creation of wealth, free tax regime, seamless infrastructure and transportation system to drive the process,” he said. According to him, the agency is desirous of establishing more free trade zones to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), supports revenue generation and values for the economy. “We have discovered that the country needs more free trade zones. The Authority is, therefore, looking at a possibility of creating special environment or zones for constituency projects. “This, we can do by establishing talent hot-spots for young people, skill acquisition centres and all such job creation out-fits that can ignite production at the grassroots,” he said.
