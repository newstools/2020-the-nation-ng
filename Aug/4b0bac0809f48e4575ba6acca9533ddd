The Accord Party (AP) has denied endorsing the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Eyitayo Jegede. It said those who carried out the purported endorsement were unknown to the party. Speaking at a news briefing in Akure, the Chairman, Ajibola Falaye, said there was no time the party collapsed its structures for Jegede. He said the AP fielded candidates who were elected at its primaries. Publicity Secretary Kennedy Peretei had in a statement claimed that the party had collapsed its structures in the 18 local governments to support the PDP. He said a chieftain of the party, Mr. Ambode Abiodun, led party leaders to the PDP secretariat where they promised to deliver not fewer than 100,000 votes to Jegede. But Falaye described the endorsement as an embarrassment, saying Abiodun and others were suspended from the party six years ago. “For the avoidance of doubt, Accord Party held primaries and Rotimi Akindejoye was elected as the governorship candidate. He has a running mate,” Falaye added.
