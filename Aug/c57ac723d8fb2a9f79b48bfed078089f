Inspite of their differences, Big Brother Naija housemate, Erica has reinstated her affection for Laycon. Erica who is currently flirting with Kiddwaya told Laycon that she still want him around her no matter what. She made this statement while they were both chatting after the first segment of a challenge. Laycon had earlier told Erica that he feels he isn’t wanted by her which might be the reason they haven’t been pals as they used to be. In her words, she said ” Don’t say you are not wanted I still want to be around you. If not, I won’t send you. If you’re coming towards me I would just look away”. Laycon further said that he feels Erica has sold her self out. Erica however asked him to make the statement clear but he didn’t.
