 HUNDREDS of sympathisers and supporters of the late billionaire hotelier and politician, Senator Buruji Kashamu, on Sunday bade him farewell in his home town of Ijebu-Igbo in Ogun State amid tributes and tears. Kashamu, the strong man of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state, was interred at around 12:45 p.m at his private home in accordance with Islamic rites. Kashamu died on Saturday at the First Cardiology Consultants Hospital, Lagos State, after a battle with COVID-19. He was 62. The late senator and philanthropist represented Ogun East in the Eighth National Assembly. Sympathisers, including Governor Dapo Abiodun; House of Assembly Speaker Olakunle Oluomo; former Deputy Governors Gbenga Kaka and Segun Adesegun as well as other prominent politicians paid glowing tributes to the deceased. They described him as a dogged fighter and helper of the needy. Other dignitaries at the funeral included former Governor Ibikunle Amosun, who was represented by Alhaji Abdul-Majeed Ekelojumati; Senator Lekan Mustapha and many royal fathers. There were also leaders and members of the League of Imams and Alfas in Ijebu North Local Government Area. Abiodun described the late Kashamu as a lover of humanity. The governor, who spoke during his condolence visit to the bereaved family, said the late senator was a man who impacted positively on many lives: as a father, leader and philanthropist. He recalled that despite their different political affiliations and ideologies, he and the late Kashamu shared intimate friendship, even as opponents in the state’s governorship election in 2019. The Grand Mufti of Ogun State Muslims, Sheikh Mikhail Rufai, admonished sympathisers to always remember that death is an inevitable end of every human journey. Imo State Governor Hope Uzodimma said Kashamu’s death was shocking, sad the sudden.  Senate Chief Whip Orji Kalu  acknowledged the philanthropic gestures of the late senator and expressed sadness over his death.
