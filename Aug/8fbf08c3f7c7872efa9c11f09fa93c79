Connected Development (CODE) says that since 2012, it has tracked about $113.6 million budgeted for projects across 181 communities in 25 states in the country. CODE, through its Follow the Money initiative, tracked N1,277,500,000 budgeted for projects in 69 grassroots communities in 2019 alone. Founder, Follow the Money and Connected Development (CODE), Mallam Hamza Lawal said  the process has saved the Federal Government and the people about N50 billion since 2012 and N477 million in 2019. He said this was done by blocking financial leakages in funded rural community projects, through an initiative that tracks government/international aid spending in health, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) and education across grassroots rural communities to ensure and promote open government and service delivery. Lawal spoke in Abuja   while flagging off CODE 2019 report and at a briefing organised on its tracking of N1.3 billion ($3.6 million) budgeted for development projects in grassroots communities. He added that the Accountant-General of the Federation had information the organisation that since 2017, over 200 Ministeries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) of government are yet to submit their audited accounts to the office of the Accountant General. He said:  “CODE isa Non-Governmental Organisation, whose main mission is to improve citizens access to credible information and empower local communities in Africa. “It’s Follow the Money initiative advocates and tracks government/international aid spending in health, WASH and education across grassroots rural communities to ensure and promote open government and service delivery. Since 2012, CODE has tracked an estimate of $113.6 million in budgeted sums for projects across 181 communities in over 25 Nigerian states, improving over four million rural lives. “In 2019, Follow the Money tracked N1,277,500,000 ($3.5 million) budgeted for projects in 69 grassroots communities, calling for improved first-mile health infrastructure and services, demanding that a state of emergencyd campaigning for communities to access safe clean water, we impacted over 2million lives. “We further saved the Nigerian people and the government the sum of N50 billion since 2012 and N477 million in 2019 by blocking financial leakage in funded rural community projects. Our work gained global recognition when Follow the Money emerged winner of the 2019 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals mobilise award and also won the Council of Europe’s Democracy Innovation award as the initiative advancing the cause of democracy. “We were informed by the Accountant-General that since 2017, over 200 Ministries departments and Agencies (MDAs) have not submitted their audited accounts, so we are calling on all MDAs of government to publish their audited accounts for Nigerians to be able to track their spending. It is not right for the President and National Assembly to every year sign the budgets of this MDAs without them submitting a yearly audit to justify their spending.”
