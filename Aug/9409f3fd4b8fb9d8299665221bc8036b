Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba has tested positive for coronavirus. France coach Didier Deschamps explained this was why he was omitted from the France squad announced Thursday for next monthâ€™s Nations League matches against Sweden and Croatia. The World Cup winner has been replaced by teenager Eduardo Camavinga, who was called up for the first time alongside Lyon midfielder Houssem Aouar and RB Leipzig defender Dayot Upamecano.
