 A FORMER governorship aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Kenneth Imasuagbon, has berated the critics of Governor Godwin Obaseki. He accepted the challenge by chieftains of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to take them on a tour of Obaseki’s projects. Imasuagbon, popularly called “Rice Man,” on Tuesday in Benin, in an interactive session with reporters, said the governor had built over 350 kilometres of road and embarked on projects. He said it was not true that Obaseki constructed only three roads in almost four years, as alleged by the Opposition. Imasuagbon said: “There is no ward in Edo State that Obaseki has not inaugurated one project or another.” He urged residents to re-elect the governor on September 19, to enable him consolidate his achievements.
