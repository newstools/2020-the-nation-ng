The Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria (TRCN) has disagreed with the Budget Office of the Federation and the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) on what revenue to remit to the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF) of the Federation from internally generated revenue (IGR) by Treasury-funded agencies. TRCN told the House Finance Committee, which is examining the 2021-2023 Medium-Term Expenditure Framework/Fiscal Strategy Paper (MTEF/FSP), that it had a letter from the Federal Ministry of Finance to remit only 25 per cent of its IGR to the CRF. But the Budget Office and the FRC said they are supposed to remit the whole of their IGR. TRCN Registrar Josiah Ajiboye, who was defending the council’s proposed revenue performance from 2018 to 2020, told the committee that it remitted 25 per cent of all its IGR to the CRF within the period under review. A representative of the Director General of the Budget Office of the Federation said all Treasury-funded agencies are expected to remit their IGR to the Treasury because all their activities are usually provided for in the Budget. The Budget Office also told the committee that it was seeing the figures by the TRCN for the first time, as the information was not available to the office. The committee’s Chairman James Faleke asked if the TRCN was captured among agencies expected to remit 25 per cent of their IGR to the Treasury. An FRC representative said the TRCN was not among the agencies, adding that it was, therefore, expected to remit its IGR to the Treasury. Ajiboye said he had a letter from the Ministry of Finance to remit only 25 per cent of the agency’s IGR, adding that the expenses being carried out with the fund was not covered by its annual budget. On why they would bypass the Budget Office and go directly to the Ministry of Finance for budget preparation, he said: “We are under the Ministry of Education and we submit our presentation through the ministry.”
