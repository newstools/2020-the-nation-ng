 BENUE State Governor Samuel Ortom has raised the alarm over what he called a planned campaign of calumny against his person and administration. Ortom alleged that a plan was being orchestrated by a Fulani group called Miyetti Allah to sponsor and sustain a negative media campaign against him. The governor stated that the campaign against him was because of his stand against open grazing and killings of harmless farmers by herdsmen. In a statement by his Chief Press Secretary (CPS) Terver Akase in Makurdi on Monday, Ortom also claimed that Miyetti Allah groups are working with the opposition to attack him. â€œIt has become necessary to alert Benue people and other Nigerians about a plan being orchestrated by Miyetti Allah groups in collaboration with some opposition elements in the state to sponsor protests and a sustained media campaign against Governor Samuel Ortom.
