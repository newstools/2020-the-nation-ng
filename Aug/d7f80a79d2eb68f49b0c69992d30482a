The Centre for Disability Issues (CDI) has hailed President Muhammadu Buhari for reconstituting the National Commission for Persons with Disabilities (NCPWD).  He was also praised for appointing its executive secretary, chairman and board members. The Coordinator, Comrade Kehinde Oshilaja, gave the commendation yesterday at Ebute Meta, Lagos at an empowerment programme organised by the centre to give succour to 100 aged members of the group. The programme with the theme: “Sustainability fund for the aged”, was attended by people living with disabilities across the state and beyond. Oshilaja rejoiced over the news of the approval of the composition of the governing council and appointment of executive secretary for NCPWD, in line with the provisions of Discrimination Against Persons with Disabilities (Prohibition) Act, 2018 by President Buhari. He said: “The approval of this list of board members of the NCPWD is a statement that the Federal Government has begun full implementation of the Discrimination against Persons with Disabilities (Prohibition) Act, 2018, also called the National Disability Act’’. Oshilaja noted that the Act would lend credence to CDI’s efforts in giving a facelift to people living with disabilities. He praised the financiers of the group, who have been taking care of the members. Added he: “We thank President Buhari, Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, as well as our patrons and financiers like Oba of Ijora, Oba Fatai Aromire, an All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain, Prince Tajudeen Olusi, Alhaji Olanrewaju  Sodiq and the rest.” Oshilaja said over the years, CDI had fought for the welfare of people living with disabilities, adding that it would continue to pursue their interests by urging the government, monarchs and private sector operators to assist them. A beneficiary of the CDI empowerment, Mr. Idowu Ogunoiki, commended the centre for fighting for their betterment.
