Rivers Governor Nyesom Wike has condemned the crisis in Edo Assembly, vowing the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) will resist ongoing plot to impeach Governor Godwin Obaseki, the party’s candidate. Wike, who is chairman of the PDP Campaign Council for the election, said the crisis was orchestrated by the All Progressives Congress (APC) to lay the foundation for removal of Obaseki. The Governor, who spoke in Government House, Port Harcourt, on Friday, said the APC was jittery ahead of the election having seen that it stood no chance at the poll with Obaseki as the governor. Wike warned against what he described as the war approach of the APC for the election saying it was endangering democracy in the country. He asked the people to hold the APC responsible if the violence snowballed into breakdown of law and order in Edo. He said: “It is now clear to all discerning minds that what is happening in Edo is a prepared script by the sinking opposition APC to intimidate PDP and illegally impeach its candidate, Godwin Obaseki having seen clearly that they cannot win the September, 20, 2020 election without any miracle. “In the circumstances we are constrained to warn that ours is still a fragile democracy and the war-like approach of the APC to the general election poses a very serious threat to the survival of democracy in Edo State and Nigeria in general. “Nigeria should, therefore, hold the APC and its candidate responsible should there be spiral and total breakdown of law and order in Edo State. “The PDP will resist every attempt to unlawfully remove Obaseki from office or rig the election against the will of majority of the people. “We, therefore, call on President Muhammadu Buhari and the international community to prevail on the APC to stop the needless violence, play the games by the rules and allow the good and peaceful people in Edo to freely elect their governor come September 19, 2020”.
