Sokoto traditional ruler and District Head of Dundaye in Wamakko Local Government Area, Muhammadu Bello Yakubu Dundaye, has advocated a comprehensive Almajiri system of education to change the negative narrative in northern Nigeria. He lamented that social menace of street begging was linked to Almajiri in parts of the country. “This has stigmatised the genuine and real purpose of the ancient system of education in the north.” Alhaji Dundaye, who is also the Sarkin Adar Dundaye, spoke weekend at the District level first Quranic recitation competition organised by the Sokoto State Recitation Committee. The monarch said federal and state governments, well-to do individuals and politicians have the obligation to re-position the Almajiri system of education to ensure discipline of the present and future generation of youths. “Governments at all levels have role to play in changing the narrative,” he said. He called on parents and guardians to support the Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal-led administration in transforming the education sector of the state to achieve high enrolment, especially of the girl-child, as well as academic and intellectual excellence at all levels of education. “The traditional institution is willing and ready to key in for the realisation of positive results in our educational development drive”, he said. He praised the state government and the Sultanate Council for its efforts to organise the competition across districts with even representation of participants.
