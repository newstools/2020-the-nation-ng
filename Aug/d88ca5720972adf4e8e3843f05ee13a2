 THE Shell Nigeria Gas Limited (SNGL) has said the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted its business operations in the country. SNG, a member of Shell companies in Nigeria targeting supply of gas to local manufacturers, lamented that most of its gas offtakers either closed shop or scaled down operations due to the pandemic. The Managing Director, SNG, Mr Ed Ubong, who spoke on a live radio programme, ‘Canvass-Niger Delta Roundtable’, monitored in Yenagoa, yesterday, said the shutdown by its 118 customers during the peak of the lockdown compelled the company to scale down operations. The managing director said that the negative impact of the virus cut across business sectors. “COVID-19 has also impacted Shell businesses in Nigeria, Shell Nigeria Gas Limited included. We are not too big to also be negatively impacted. This pandemic is unprecedented,’’ Ubong said.
