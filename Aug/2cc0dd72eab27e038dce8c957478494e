Daryl Dike, younger brother of former Super Eagles attacker Bright Dike, is delighted after his  scoring debut for Orlando City in the US Major League Soccer (MLS) last weekend. The youngest of the Dike family who also  has Super Falcons Courtney Dike, got his maiden appearance for Orlando City on Sunday against Inter Miami in a game he ended on a losing side despite scoring a goal and assisting for  the second goal. Daryl in an post-match press conference  posted on his club website noted that he is thrilled to start his professional career with a bang and he attributed his seamless transition to the wonder work done by his teammates and the technical crew. The attacker promised to continue to give his best for the Orlando City team in their next game against Nashville tomorrow.
