A Transporter has been telling police detectives in Niger State how he came about 375 rounds of live ammunition and seven AK47 magazines allegedly found in his vehicle. Police said Abubakar Adamu was driving a red Civic Honda car loaded with the ammunition when he was arrested in Suleja. Adamu reportedly said he was part of a robbery and kidnap syndicate, adding that his role was transporting the group’s weapons. The suspect, who said he took orders from one man in Kaduna, added that he was promised N150,000 for the botched trip. Police spokesman Abiodun Wasiu said Adamu was apprehended by anti-robbery operatives attached to Suleja after a tip-off. “During interrogation, the suspect confessed to being a member of a robbery and kidnap syndicate, with responsibility to transport arms and ammunition for the syndicate,” he said.
