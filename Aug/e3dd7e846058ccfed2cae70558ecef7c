The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has vowed to shut down any school within Abuja that violates the COVID-19 guidelines recommended for the safety of students, who resumed schools few days ago to prepare students for exit examination. Chairman of FCTA Ministerial Task Force on COVID-19 Enforcement, Ikharo Attah, who led the team to inspect some schools within the nationâ€™s capital, stated that the administration cannot afford to expose students to the danger of contracting Coronavirus. Attah said the administration will not compromise the guidelines for the resumption of schools.
