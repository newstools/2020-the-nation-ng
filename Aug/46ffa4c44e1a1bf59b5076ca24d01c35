Kano State Government has begun the administration of anti-malarial drugs to children aged between three to 59 months to reduce malaria-related illnesses and deaths. Commissioner of Health, Aminu Tsanyawa, stated that the government had adopted the “Seasonal Malaria Chemoprophylaxis” (SMC) in eliminating or controlling malaria in children, which prevents them from dying from mosquito bites. He said that the SMC was being administered in Kano because it was recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) for the Sahel sub-region that has areas with high seasonal malaria transmission during the rainy season when most childhood malaria diseases and deaths occur. Tsanyawa said that the SMC is usually in cycles of four months from July to October, using sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine (SPAQ) and P.falciparum. “The prevention of malaria transmission during this period (July, August, September and October) is effective and is 75 per cent protective against uncomplicated and severe malaria in children under five years of age. “The SMC exercise, targeting about 2.9 million children of 3-59 months is in progress in the 44 local government areas of Kano State. “Cycle one was conducted successfully on 2.9 million children from July 13-16. The Second Cycle on three million children was carried out on August 10-13.” Tsanyawa noted that the entire exercise will gulp N3 billion, as it involves qualitative drugs, engaging 23,000 Community Drugs Distributors (CCDs), over 10,000 HCWs in 1,233 referring health facilities and a team of supervisors at state and local government areas who all must be paid.
