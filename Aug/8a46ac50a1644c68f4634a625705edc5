The Supreme Court has upheld the return of Yahaya Bello as winner of the last governorship election in Kogi State. In a unanimous judgment delivered a moment ago, the court’s seven-man panel led by the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Ibrahim Tanko, dismissed the appeal by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its candidate in the election, Musa Wada.

The court is about to deliver its judgment in the appeal by the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and its candidate in the election. Details shortly…
