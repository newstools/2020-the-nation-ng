Foreign portfolio investors have restarted intense bargain-hunting for Nigerian value stocks as stable second quarter earnings, locked-up foreign exchange, low fixed-income yields and attractive valuations appeared to be driving inflows into quoted equities. Trading data at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) at the weekend showed that foreign portfolio investors stirred the bulls in major sectors of the economy with increased orders for attractive stocks in the oil and gas, telecommunications and consumer goods sectors. Increased bargain-hunting by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) led Nigerian equities market to its third consecutive positive closing position at the weekend, the first of such trends in seven months. Average return at the Nigerian equities market closed weekend at 0.63 per cent, equivalent to net capital appreciation of N83 billion for the week. The NSE Oil and Gas Index, which tracks the oil and gas sector, posted average gain of 5.92 per cent while the NSE Consumer Goods Index appreciated by 2.25 per cent. Market analysts said the positive return for the market was driven mainly by activities of FPIs on some major stocks. Analysts at Cordros Securities said the market was driven by “foreign investors taking positions in fungible stocks”.  Afrinvest Securities said the positive market performance was due activities in certain stocks in the telecommunication and banking sectors. The Nation had exclusively reported that latest report on FPIs had shown improvement in June 2020 after FPIs touched 29-month low in May 2020. FPIs rose to N56.34 billion in June 2020 as against N35.24 billion recorded in May 2020. FPI inflows improved from N18.43 billion in May 2020 to N25.27 billion in June 2020 while outflows also increased from N16.81 billion in May 2020 to N31.07 billion in June 2020. The All Share Index (ASI)- the common value-based index that tracks share prices at the NSE, at the weekend closed at 25,199.84 points as against its opening index of 25,041.89 points last week. Aggregate market value of all quoted equities also rose from its opening value of N13.063 trillion to close weekend at N13.146 trillion.

Analysts at Afrinvest Securities said they expected a mixed performance this week “as investors take profit while seeking bargain hunting opportunities”. “Our view continues to favour cautious trading as risks remain on the horizon due to a combination of the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria and weak economic conditions. Thus, we continue to advise investors to seek trading opportunities in only fundamentally justified stocks,” Cordros Securities stated.
