Ondo State All Progressives Congress (APC) has accused the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Eyitayo Jegede, of overseeing white elephant projects during the administration of former governor Olusegun Mimiko. It was reacting to Jegede’s comments that the Ore interchange flyover was a phoney project by Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu. Director, Media and Publicity of the Ondo APC, Mr. Steve Otaloro, in a statement, said the Ore interchange bridge was to reduce traffic jam and the rate of vehicular accidents, which claimed people’s lives in the area. He urged Jegede to do his findings before committing himself to wild submissions. Otaloro said it was pitiable for Jegede to condemn the Ore interchange bridge when it was he who chaired the committee that recommended the construction of the dome, but terminated the construction of the 10,000 capacity new stadium, Owena water reticulation projects and several other projects embarked on by the administration of the late Dr. Olusegun Agagu. “The present path of recovery, growth and infrastructural development of the state that Arakunrin Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has started, would not be allowed to be derailed by the same people who put us into such mess as rightly highlighted herein, Godwilling.”
