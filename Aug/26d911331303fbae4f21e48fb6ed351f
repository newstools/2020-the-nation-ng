Social activities and gatherings for the 2020 Udiroko festival, which marks the first day in Ado-Ekiti traditional calendar, has been cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Ewi of Ado-Ekiti, Oba Rufus Adejugbe, stated this on Monday to reporters in his palace at Ado-Ekiti, the state capital. Oba Adejugbe said the usual pomp and pageantry associated with the festival slated for August 30 had been cancelled in obedience to the government’s directives prohibiting public gathering. The theme of the celebration is “Celebration of our history, culture, and tradition in a period of the global pandemic and its challenges.” The Monarch said the festival would be observed with strict adherence to COVID-19 safety guidelines. He noted only senior chiefs and head of the three principal quarters would be allowed into the palace purposely to offer prayers for the town, the state, and the country at large. While lamenting the negative impact of westernisation on culture and tradition, Ewi noted the annual celebration of the festival had helped in showcasing the history, culture and tradition of Ado-Ekiti. He explained it would be difficult to cancel the festival considering the importance to the peace and development of the community. Oba Adejugbe revealed the planning committee would be making use of technology to beam the event for residents in the state and across the world, adding “what we will be doing is no secret, it is pure prayer and we want people to watch us.”
