However because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the centenary celebrations have been moved to December. The four-day event scheduled for December 3-6 would feature a road show, centennial lecture, merit awards and party. The group praised the founding fathers the administrators, and students of the school for their investment over the years. Anglican Comprehensive High School Ikoto was founded by Anglican Mission on August 16, 1920 within the premises of Anglican Church Italupe, Ijebu-Ode as the first girls’ school in Ogun State.  The early life of the school was guided by Rev. S J. Gansalo as the first Principal and Rev. E. A. Kayode. In 1934, the school moved to its then permanent site on an extensive open area in Igbeba Road (Okeyinbo) in Ijebu-Ode. Upon the establishment of Ogun State College of Education in 1977, the school was again temporarily moved to Sani Luba High School, Ijebu ode while the search for a permanent location lasted. With the help of the pioneer students and other alumni, the school was finally settled in the old site of St. Matthew ‘’s Teacher’s College, Ikoto as a Secondary Commercial School in 1978. On January 29, 1980, the school was upgraded to a full secondary grammar school and renamed Anglican Comprehensive High School Ikoto under Late Rev. Funmilayo Badejo as the first principal.
