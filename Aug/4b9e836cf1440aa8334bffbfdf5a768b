The governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Eyitayo Jegede, has said the party has remained a united force. Jegede, who denied reports that his emergence as the PDP candidate has caused a crack within the party, said he and the PDP leadership had hit the ground running to win votes. Speaking through the Head, Media Research for Eyitayo Jegede Campaign Organisation (EJCO), Mr. Samuel Fasua, Jegede described the report as false, misleading and unsubstantiated. He said he emerged as the PDP candidate, having scored the highest votes cast at the primary election. Jegede noted that other aspirants have congratulated him. He said: “While we value individuals’ right to their opinions, we feel compelled to raise the flag regarding an allegation by this group that Jegede is seen by these unhappy (PDP) leaders as a follower of the ideology championed by former vice president and PDP presidential candidate in the 2019 general election, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar. “Although this group hailed the election of Jegede, describing him as the choice of the people, it neither identified the leaders that were unhappy with Jegede’s emergence nor stated the nature of Atiku’s ideology that Jegede would pursue. “The group, as such, relied on these assumptions to declare that there is crisis in Ondo PDP, over Jegede’s emergence. “Shortly after the primary election, we held a free and fair congress during which new executive officers emerged. Those who contested and did not win congratulated the winners. “Therefore, we urge that the Vanguard for Justice and Fairness in PDP should channel its energy to selling the programmes of action of Jegede, who is out to restore good governance to Ondo State, rather than plying the low road of presenting fairy tales as the truth.”
