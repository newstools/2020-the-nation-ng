The Aare Ona Kakanfo-in-Council has revealed that suspected ISIS operatives and terrorists are now in Oke-Ogun area of Oyo State. The council stated this in a communique issued after an extraordinary meeting presided over by the Ààrẹ Ọ̀nà Kakaǹfò of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams, on the state of the Yoruba nation and sundry matters affecting the Nigerian state on Sunday, August 23, according to a local online newspaper, oyoinsight.com. The paper quoted the communique in part: “The Ààrẹ Ona Kakanfo-in-Council has in its possession credible intelligence, gathered from within and outside the country, which strongly indicates the infiltration of terrorists and killer Fulani herdsmen in the region. “More worrisome, the intelligence report also reveals that suspected ISIS operatives have already positioned themselves in Niger State via Ìbàrùbáland and are now within the Òkè-ògùn corridor of Ọ̀yọ́ State. Indeed, the intel also reveals that about 500 power bikes and assorted ammunition belonging to the terrorists have been physically sighted along the abandoned Lusada route moving towards Sokoto, from Igbó-ọrà in Ọ̀yọ́ State.” The council also enjoined all Southwest governors as well as the governors of Kwara and Kogi states to emulate the Governor of Benue State, Mr. Samuel Ortom, by directing their citizens to apply for a gun license for self-defense against the marauding terrorists and killer herdsmen. Similarly, the council urged the Federal Government to take urgent steps to tighten Nigeria’s borders, especially the lengthy and porous borders with northern West African neighbours with a view to stopping the illegal entry of killer herdsmen and other criminals into the country. When contacted, Aare Gani Adams confirmed the statement.
