Residents of Ngo community in Andoni Local Government of Rivers State have appealed to Governor Nyesom Wike to reopen their general hospital, which was shut in February owing to insecurity. President of the National Union of Andoni Students (NUAS) Efuk Festus, during a tour of the hospital on Wednesday, lamented that the facility had been overtaken by weed and rodents. It was gathered doctors posted fled the area following insecurity, especially kidnapping. Festus said: “Our general hospital has been locked since February; grasses have overtaken it and it is sad because the people cannot access medical help when they fall ill. “We beg Governor Wike to reopen the facility because our people are suffering. This is the seventh month this hospital has been shut, we heard doctors have been posted here but we are yet to see them.” Efforts to reach the Commissioner for Health, Prof. Princewill Chike, were unsuccessful as he did not respond to calls and text messages sent to his phone.
