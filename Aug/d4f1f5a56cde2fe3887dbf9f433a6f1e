A breakdown of daily figures from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control shows that Nigeria recorded fewer cases, less deaths and more recoveries last week compared to the previous week, writes Associate Editor ADEKUNLE YUSUF. After five months of managing coronavirus crisis, a global pandemic that has resulted in more than 18 million infections and close to 700,000 deaths worldwide, Nigeria is gradually returning into normalcy. Amidst caution, restrictions on movement and gatherings are gradually being lifted both the federal and state governments, as economic activities, schools, restaurants, religious homes and other activities slowly regain their full bloom. So far, since Nigeria recorded its index case on February 27, a total of 283,916 coronavirus tests have been carried out as of August 1 – thanks to the gradual expansion of the country’s testing capacity for Covid-19.  Last week alone (that is from Sunday July 26 to Saturday August 1), data from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) showed that there were 3,560 new infections, 27 deaths and 3,139 recoveries recorded across Nigeria’s 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). This was slightly lower than what obtained in the previous week (July 19 to 25), when Nigeria recorded a total of 3,870 new coronavirus infections and 78 deaths in one week. High number of recovered and discharged As of Saturday August 1, official figures revealed that a total of 43,537 coronavirus infections have been confirmed in Nigeria. According to the daily updates by NCDC, 20,087 out of 43,537 people who tested positive have since recovered and discharged; while 883 deaths have been recorded in Nigeria. This showed that about half of confirmed cases in the country have recovered from their infections and reunited with their families. Whereas, in South Africa, coronavirus has claimed 8,153 souls and infected more than 500,000; while Egypt, which has 94,316 positives cases, has lost 4,834 people to the contagious virus within the same period. Predictably, Lagos, where the first case was recorded and which has remained the coronavirus epicentre in Nigeria, has led in the figures – from new cases to fatality figures. As at August 1, Lagos, inhabited by an estimated 20 million people, had recorded a total of 15,186 confirmed cases – almost half of the country’s total. There have been 2,148 discharged cases in the state; while 192 patients had died since February. The FCT came second with 3,933 confirmed cases, 1,142 recoveries and 42 deaths. Other states with over 1000 confirmed cases include Oyo with 2,768 cases, 1337 recovered and 27 deaths; Edo with 2,300 confirmed cases, 1,842 recovered and 83 deaths; Rivers with 1,806 confirmed cases, 1,459 recovered cases ad 53 deaths; Kano with 1,597 confirmed cases, 1,258 recovered cases and 53 deaths; Kano with 1,597 confirmed cases, 1,258 recovered cases and 53 deaths; Delta with 1,510 confirmed cases, 1,359 recovered cases and 43 deaths; Kaduna with 1,457 confirmed cases, 1,176 recovered and 12 deaths; Ogun with 1,397 confirmed cases, 1,140 recovered cases and 23 deaths; Plateau with 1,211 confirmed cases, 534 recovered cases and 19 deaths and Ondo with 1,192 confirmed cases, 648 recovered cases and 25 deaths.
