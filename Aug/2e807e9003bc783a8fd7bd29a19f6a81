The 2013 FIFA  U-17 World Cup-winning coach  Manu Garba has implored the duo of Kelechi Nwakali and Kelechi Iheanacho to  step up their game in order to fulfil their potentials. Garba  noted that both players must ensure they work more  with their respective  teams  during on or off the ball situations, adding players who refuse to help the team after losing possession run the risk of being surplus to requirement. “He (Kelechi Nwakali)is very talented but off the ball he doesn’t work much. This is just one of his flaws he has to work on,” Garba explained in an interview.”No matter who you are on the pitch, when you lose ball possession you should be able to fight to retrieve it. Any player that does that is a minus to the team and such player risks being sold.” On Kelechi Iheanacho’s possible exit from Leicester City,  the former Gombe United gaffer expressed surprise at  the striker’s  struggling  posture with the Foxes despite his goal scoring ability  that helped the Golden Eaglets claimed the 2013 FIFA Under 17 World Cup in the UAE. He said many believed that Iheanacho should be playing for one of the best teams in the world and he implored the attacker to rediscover himself and not allow anything to distract him. “Like I said about Nwakali , no coach will want to keep players that do not continue working off the ball. Iheanacho must  also work on that aspect too,” Garba concluded.
