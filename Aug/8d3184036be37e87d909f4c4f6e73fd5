With over two decades of experience in the hospitality business, UK-trained lawyer, Steve Omamuli, is not here to prove to his critics wrong again. His track records and feats in the hospitality business are receipts of his magic wands and unparalleled success. He knows the business like the back of his hands. Many wonder how he has been able to balance both the hospitality and legal profession and the cosmopolitan lawyer is quick to say hospitality for is a passion, hence juggling both sectors come easily. Despite the hospitality business being hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, he remained dogged, stayed afloat, sustained his business, and retained his work-force. On Saturday, August 15, the dark lanky personality gathered friends and family to the 10th anniversary of his upscale Class Suite Hotel located at Opebi, Ikeja for the second anniversary as well as the official launching of Multi-faceted Gym in Class Suites (Signature).
