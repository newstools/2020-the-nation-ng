All Progressives Congress (APC) standard-bearer Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu has assured people of job creation via investments in agricultural development, if elected as governor. Speaking during his ward-to-ward campaign at Agbede, Iyakpi and Auchi in Etsako-West Local Government, he said Edo was made up of agrarian communities that could grow the state’s economy. Ize-Iyamu said he would revive the rice production capacity at Agbede via empowerment and provision of loans to farmers. “If elected, agriculture will be prioritised because of its potential to create jobs and improve the Gross Domestic Product. “Agbede has the potential to supply rice to every area in the state if farmers are supported to grow the crop,” he added. At Iyakpi, South-Ibie, Ize-Iyamu said he would prioritise youth and women empowerment, as well as renovation of schools. His running mate, Alhaji Gani Audu, an indigene of Agbede, assured the people of good governance if elected. He urged the people to come out en masse and vote for the APC on September 19. The party received scores of defectors from opposition parties at the rally.
