 AS you may already know, the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) and the Nigeria Postal Service (NIPOST) are at loggerheads over the discharge of their duties. Chairman of NIPOST, Maimuna Abubakar, in a series of tweets, accused the FIRS of stealing the parastatal’s mandate. But FIRS’ spokesperson, Abdullahi Ahmad, argued the NIPOST boss didn’t tell the truth, claiming that the power to collect stamp duties resides with FIRS. According to him, it is the sole agency of government charged with responsibility of assessing, collecting, and accounting for all tax types including Stamp Duties. For many Nigerians the exchanges are needless as the dispute can be resolved by supervising offices within the same government. Observers are of the opinion that what is at stake is beyond stamps and stamp duties. It appears a major expose may be in the offing. In fact, some have come out to openly say another round of allegations and counter allegations of corruption and sharp practices is brewing. If you still don’t get the drift, take a second look at this part of the explanation offered by Ahmad on behalf of FIRS. “We wish to state categorically that, as an agency which operates within the ambit of the law, the FIRS is determined to not only ensure that all monies collected by NIPOST into its illegally operated Stamp Duties Account are fully remitted into the Federation Account but also make sure that any kobo not accounted for in that account is legally recovered in line with the charge of President Muhammadu Buhari to the recently inaugurated inter-ministerial committee on the recovery of stamp duties from 2016 till date.”
