Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Deputy Governor Obafemi Hamzat and Speaker of the House of Assembly Mudashiru Obasa have mourned the All Progressives Congress (APC) Chieftain, Lanre Razak. Sanwo-Olu and Hamzat visited the Razak family home in Epe yesterday. They were received by the deceased’s son Bayo; League of Imams in Epe; Tunde Seriki and others. Hamzat, who spoke on behalf of the governor, sympathised with the family and prayed for God’s mercy upon them. Bayo, who thanked Sanwo-Olu for the visit, urged other political leaders to imbibe the virtues of love and charity which he said his late father exhibited. He described his father as a cheerful giver and lover of all. “We will not allow the sweat of our father to go in vain. We, the children, will uphold his integrity and passion for humanity and community growth. We miss him so much and he will forever be remembered,” he said. Obasa described Razak’s death as a major loss to the state and party. In a statement from his office, he said: “Chief Razak was a marked example for politicians of true loyalty. He was always  putting in efforts to the advancement of Lagos State. I pray God grants him eternal rest and give us the fortitude to bear the loss.”
