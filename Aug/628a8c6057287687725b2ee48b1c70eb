 The Yoruba Appraisal Forum (YAF) has warned groups claiming to champion the cause of Yoruba people to stop subversive and unpatriotic utterances and activities. YAF vowed to resist these self-acclaimed freedom fighters in Yorubaland who ‘want to throw our motherland into needless chaos, destruction and desolation’. A statement by Coordinator Adeshina Animashaun accused the Yoruba World Congress (YWC) of planning violence and destruction on the Yoruba people.  It reads: “We will not watch a few disgruntled and self-serving individuals to turn Yorubaland into another Somalia  where anarchy, bloodshed, proliferation of arms and destruction of life and property becomes the norm. “If it becomes imperative for Yorubaland to break away… it should be a collective decision of Yoruba people within Nigeria and in the Diaspora. It should not be a decision for a caucus of selfish individuals.”
