The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kwara State has applauded the positive ratings of the state’s employment status by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). Spokesperson Tajudeen Aro said the ratings underscored the efforts of Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq to reposition the state for growth. He said: “The NBE’s employment indices for the second quarter of 2020 (April-June) showed that Kwara’s unemployment rate slowed from 21.1 per cent to 13.8 per cent — one of the lowest in Nigeria. “These statistics underscore the superlative performance of Governor AbdulRazaq, who continues to … improve the people’s lot. “We take cognisance of the fact that the low unemployment rate posted for Kwara came at the height of the COVID-19 lockdown when millions of jobs were lost. This was the time the governor committed public resources to the fight against the pandemic with the strategic engagement of local people for production of protective materials. He equally ensured that major firms remained in partial operation in strict compliance with the COVID-19 protocols. “All these ensured minimal loss of jobs while rolling out micro-economic strategies to keep people productively engaged and tackle mass poverty. We congratulate the governor for this feat and urge him to remain focused in stabilising Kwara for socioeconomic development…”
