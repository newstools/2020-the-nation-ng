Mallam Mamman Daura, President Muhmmadu Buhari’s influential nephew, has been reportedly flown to the United Kingdom (UK) for urgent medical attention, according to an online medium Sahara Reporters. It was gathered he was flown out on Wednesday. But efforts by The Nation to confirm the report from presidential spokesmen and officials proved abortive. Some of them didn’t respond to calls or texts sent to them. Daura was said to have been flown to a hospital in the UK in a private jet after manifesting “respiratory difficulties,” fuelling suspicions of COVID-19. It was further claimed the 79- year- old had been under watch since last Friday.
