Barcelona manager Quique Setien is to be sacked today  and Netherlands coach Ronald Koeman could reportedly be the man to replace him. La Liga runners-up Barcelona were humiliated in an 8-2 loss to Bayern Munich as they crashed out of the Champions League at the quarter-final stage on Friday. Spanish football expert Guillem Balague said  former Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino has “been approached”, but ex-Barca player Koeman would be a more popular choice. “The board will meet tomorrow and [Setien] will be sacked,” Balague told the BBC 5 Live Euro Leagues podcast. “They have to choose a manager because in two weeks’ time pre-season starts – and the talk is Koeman could be the man.” Meanwhile, Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu is planning a massive overhaul of the Catalan club’s and reportedly wants to totally refresh Barca’s ageing squad and has put every senior player in the team up for sale bar four: Marc-Andre ter Stegen, Clement Lenglet, Frankie De Jong and Lionel Messi.
