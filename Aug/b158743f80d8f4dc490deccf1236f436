 NOLLYWOOD actress, Omotola Jalade Ekeinde, also known as Omosexy, on Saturday said she has tested positive for COVID-19 and is currently in isolation where she’s receiving treatment. The 42-year-old actress broke the news on her Instagram handle where she told her fans that though she is getting better, she has remained in isolation. As she puts it, “Hello all, I know most of you have been wondering where I’ve been. ”Well, I contracted COVID. I have been ill, in Isolation and now getting better.” Omotola also revealed that while in isolation, she has been reading. Commenting on one of the touching stories she read recently, the death of Immaculate Okochu, who was crushed to death in Lagos, months to her wedding, Omotola called on Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, to take action that will stop such incidents. “I have been Reading on the devastating News of How our Youths are Needlessly Dying getting crushed by Trailers/containers! This is disheartening and has made my heart really troubled! This can happen to ANYONE and Enforcements can’t be taken lightly on this Gov @jidesanwoolu!!! Please do something,” she wrote.
