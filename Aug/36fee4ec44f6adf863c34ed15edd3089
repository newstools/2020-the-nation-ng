Ellah Lakes Plc has entered into exclusive discussions to acquire an oil palm processing company. In a regulatory filing, the board of Ellah Lakes indicated that the agricultural company plans to purchase 100 per cent equities of an oil palm processing company with substantial assets in Delta State. “Though a binding term sheet has been agreed, the completion of the proposed transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and execution of a definitive agreement,” the company stated. Ellah Lakes urged investors to take note of the potential transaction while dealing on its securities noting that more updates will be provided to the investing public in accordance with disclosure requirements. Ellah Lakes, incorporated on July 2, 1980, was listed on the NSE on January 14, 1993. Originally a fish-farming company, the firm had embarked on a comprehensive restructuring and diversification of its businesses. Last year, it acquired Telluria to diversify its products in the agribusiness sector.
