 EBERECHI EZE has revealed how Crystal Palace convinced him a move to south London was the right one for him. The Eagles have completed a deal to bring the forward to Selhurst Park from Queens Park Rangers on a five-year contract. The 22-year-old, who was also a target for London rivals West Ham as well as newly promoted West Brom, is the club’s most expensive signing under manager Roy Hodgson, who has been calling for investment in recent years. Palace have paid QPR around £14.5million up front in a deal which could rise to almost £20million after add-ons. Facing stiff competition for his signature, Palace pitched their plan for the future to Eze, who was won over by the role he was offered under Hodgson. “If I am honest it was the plan that was set out for me and what they have said about me,” he said. “It was the most in line with what I feel about myself and that is the most important thing for me, more than what the club is or whatever – the plan that they have for me and where they see me. “It is the position they want me to play, their goals, where they want to push and what they want to become, how they see me fitting in that system and they want me to play. The style of football they want to play now suits me.” The Eagles, who have already secured 19-year-old right-back Nathan Ferguson this summer, have been tracking Eze since the start of last season and saw an approach knocked back by Rangers in January this year.
