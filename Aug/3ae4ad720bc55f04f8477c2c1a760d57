 JUDICIARY workers in Ebonyi State on Thursday began strike to demand improved welfare. The workers urged the government to implement the Consolidated Judiciary Salary Structure (CJSS). At the state judiciary headquarters, no worker was sighted within the premises. But some youths clustered around the gate. Policemen were also at the gate. The workers, about three weeks ago, issued a 21-day ultimatum, for the state to implement the CJSS. Vice President of the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (Southeast) Mark Ifezue said the national leadership mandated workers to withdraw their services pending implementation of the wage structure. He said: “I am here to show solidarity with the workers over the implementation of their salary structure. This package worked for all judicial workers in Nigeria, both at the federal and state level. “Virtually all states are implementing the package but Ebonyi has refused to do that. The workers have been on this  struggle since 2015 and nothing positive has come out of it. “I am here as a messenger of the National President, Comrade Lawal Mustapha. We have had series of meetings and agreement with the government but it always reneged…” Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice Cletus Ophoke said workers on strike at this pandemic time was regrettable and ill-advised.
