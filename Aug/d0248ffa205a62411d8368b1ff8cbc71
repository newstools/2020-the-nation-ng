The Joint Health Sector Union and Assembly of Health Care Professionals (JOHESU) Bauchi State Chapter has suspended the indefinite strike it embarked upon last Thursday. The new development was disclosed by the Secretary of the JOHESU, Comrade Usman Danturaki while addressing journalists in Bauchi, the capital. He said that further negotiations were still ongoing to address the issues once and for all. According to him JOHESU went on an indefinite strike to protest the unilateral deductions made by the state government in its June and July 2020 salaries. He said they embarked on the strike after several efforts made to draw the attention of the state government to their plights proved fruitless. Danturaki stated that the strike has been called off having been convinced with the steps taken by the government prior to the commencement of the strike, coupled with ardent desire to meet our demands. “JOHESU have resolved to suspend the strike action with immediate effect so as to pave way for further negotiations to continue on Monday August 10, 2020 where agreement on major issues shall be reached and signed accordingly,” the Secretary, said. Speaking earlier, the Commissioner for Finance, Alhaji Umaru Sanda Adamu said that the biggest challenges of the state government was the over-bloated workforce that gulps state revenues.
