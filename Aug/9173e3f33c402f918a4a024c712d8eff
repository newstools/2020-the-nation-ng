 Nigerian international striker Victor Osimhen and his new  Napoli  teammates are  expected to arrive at  their Castel di Sangro preseason camp in Abruzzo  today  to begin  preparation ahead of the forthcoming Italian Serie A season. Already, the Gil Azzurri  are expected to play few training matches with two friendly matches with local team  L’Aquila and Castel di Sangro on  August 28 before taking on  Teramo on 4 September 4th. The club yesterday said  fans willing to watch the  training matches  as well as the friendly matches will be subjected to strict COVID-19 protocols.  Meanwhile, Napoli coach Gennaro Gattuso is reportedly mulling over the possibility of changing  his side’s system of play  in favour of  Osimhen. The 21-year-old who scored 18 goals and four assists in all competitions for Lille before Ligue 1 was cancelled due to the COVID was snapped up  last month for a club-record fee of 70 million Euros totalling  80 million Euros with add-on . According to the Corriere dello Sport: “The 4-3-3 would not be suitable, because Dries Mertens is now too old to play entirely on the wing of a trident attack and would struggle with the extra work-load. Instead, the coach is believed to be planning a 4-2-3-1 system with Mertens, Lorenzo Insigne and Eljif Elmas or Piotr Zielinski in support.”
