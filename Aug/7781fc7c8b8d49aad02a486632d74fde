 POPE Francis on Wednesday, warned against any prospect that rich people would get priority for Coronavirus vaccine. Pope Francis in a public engagement said “the pandemic is a crisis in which the world would never come out of remaining the same – either better or worse.” He added that “we must come out better.” The pontiff said the world cannot return to normality, after the COVID-19 pandemic, if normal means social injustice and degradation of the natural environment. Pope Francis, said the Coronavirus pandemic should serve as an opportunity to build a fairer and greener society, warning against a return to the old normal. “We are all worried for the social consequences of the pandemic, all of us. Many want to go back to normal and resume economic activities.”
