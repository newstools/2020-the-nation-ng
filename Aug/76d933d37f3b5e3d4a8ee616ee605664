Inter Milan Coach Antonio Conte will have Alexis Sanchez back in contention for the Europa League Final spot against Sevilla tonight. The Chilean was Inter’s biggest doubt ahead of the showpiece, but Conte is optimistic regarding the centre-forward’s recovery. The former Manchester United player completed training with his teammates Thursday and the coach considers him completely recovered from the hamstring injury he suffered against Bayer Leverkusen in Duisburg. Reports claim Sanchez will most likely start on the bench, next to Christian Eriksen as the Nerazzurri are set to continue with Romelu Lukaku and Lautaro Martinez up front. But the 31-year-old will provide an extra option from the bench in Cologne.
