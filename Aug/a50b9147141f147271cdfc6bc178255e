The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) will retain the 2019 Edo State voter register for the governorship election, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) Dr. Johnson Alalibo made this known during a dialogue with the Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room, a coalition of over 70 civil society organisations, in Abuja. He said there are 2,210,534 total registered voters in Edo, while the voter cards collected are 1,726,738. “The commission suspended collection of voter cards with continuous voter registration due to the COVID-19 pandemic. So, we are reverting to what we had in the 2019 general election. This is what we are using.”
