Ondo State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) has donated materials to the All Progressives Congress (APC) ahead of the campaign for the October 10 governorship election. SUBEB Chairperson Princess Oladuni Odu presented items such as posters, fez caps and 500 T-shirts with the inscription such as AKETI 2020 and the APC logo. Odu is the first political office holder to present campaign materials to the APC. She said the items were meant to boost the re-election bid of the party’s candidate, Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu. The SUBEB boss noted that the supremacy of the party required that politicians and political office holders should support and respect the party structure. She said those who had experienced life outside the government would appreciate how enticing it was to be in power, adding that leaders should work together to ensure victory for the party’s candidate in October. “This is my widow’s mite, donated to the party for the success of our governorship campaign. I must say it is a demonstration of my loyalty and commitment to the party and its success at the governorship election in October,” Odu said. APC Chairman Ade Adetimehin hailed Odu for having regard for party structure. He noted that only a few politicians would return to support the party after securing appointments. Adetimehin said: “I’m not surprised at what Princess Odu has done today. It takes people like you in positions of authority to build a strong party. I can assure you that the party structure will stand by you when you need it.” He promised to ensure that the items were distributed among the 18 local government party chairmen so that the impact of the donation would be felt by all.
