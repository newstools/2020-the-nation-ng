The governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, has said he has no plan to return the loosely-organised gangs called the agbero to the streets of Edo State. He said he intended to rehabilitate and reintegrate the agbero into the society as useful and responsible citizens, if elected on September 19. Ize-Iyamu, yesterday in an online statement by the Chairman of Edo APC Media Campaign Council, Prince John Mayaki, attributed the false report of his purported plan to return the gangs to the state to terrorise residents as a deliberate falsehood manufactured and spread by the Opposition to deceive the electorate and conceal the hypocrisy and fraud of Governor Godwin Obaseki of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).
