Bright O has described Praise as a foolish person going by how he acts and talks. On Thursday, while playing the “Ayo” game with Kiddwaya, he declared he will no longer give Praise the privilege of bullying him anymore. “I’ll start telling him things that will get him too angry and pissed which can make him cry because I already know his weak point,” he stressed. When Kiddwaya asked what those things were, he said: “I know he likes to brag a lot about his son and fiancé but she’s above 60 years and way older than him.” Kiddwaya also agreed Praise is a bully, which is why he doesn’t react to his jokes and bullying to avoid disqualification.
