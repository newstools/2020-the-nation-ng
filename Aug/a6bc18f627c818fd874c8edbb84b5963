 EBONYI State Governor David Umahi has said God will decide his next destination after 2023. Umahi was reacting to speculations that he was eyeing the presidency. He spoke yesterday while inspecting projects, including Ebonyi Airport, International Shopping Mall, and Exco Chambers at the Government House. The governor said he did so much as governor and ‘would want to rest’ after leaving office. He said: “I have worked so hard from my youth, even harder for the government, but it is up to God to decide whether I should rest.. God is on my mind; where He wants me to go, I will go and what He wants me to do, I will do. “I keep saying leadership is about the fear of God, passion to work for the people and the realisation that this is a transitional camp …” The governor said he embarked on projects to enhance the people’s wellbeing and correct the notion about the state which made people to ‘look down’ on it. “We want to punish people who underrate us by embarking on these projects that they cannot see elsewhere. When you have the passion to help people, God will be with you and give you the divine wisdom to actualise all your goals.”
