BBNaija Pepper Dem runner up, Mike Edwards, is yet to pick a favourite Housemate as the reality TV show enters week five. The former Housemate has been pleading with fans to suggest which of the Housemates to support. “I haven’t picked a fave yet o who should I stand or is it still too early?” he asked rhetorically. After the show kicked off on July 19, Edward informed his followers to give him some time to study the Housemates before choosing his favourite. But BBA ex-Housemate and winner, Uti Nwachukwu, has been showing his support for the current Head of House, Kiddwaya. Uti has been vocal about his support for Kiddwaya on social media and couldn’t contain his joy when the 27-year-old won the fifth Head of House challenge. Uti, an ardent viewer of the show, also hoped Lucy will be picked as the Deputy HoH since Erica, who is Kiddwaya’s love interest, is not eligible.
