 NATIONAL Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has appealed to Osun residents to vacate river banks and waterways to avoid loss of life and property. The agency warned there would be heavy rain between August and November resulting in flooding. Zonal Head of Operations for Ekiti, Osun and Ondo states, Olusegun Afolayan, yesterday went round flood-prone areas with his team and officials of State Emergency Management Agency (OSEMA) in Osogbo. According to him, Osun was one of the 28 states Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NIMET) said would experience flooding.  He said: “The only way to reduce effects of the predicted flooding is by allowing the water to flow its natural course without hindrance. “We have high probable risk flood areas in Osogbo and Ila-Orangun, together with 14 other local governments. I appeal to residents living close to river banks and waterways to leave the area before the rains begin, to avoid losing life and property.”
