 CHAIRMAN of Enugu Capital Territory Development Authority (ECTDA) Josef Onoh has debunked speculations he is contesting for governor. Onoh’s posters  surfaced in the state capital, urging him to contest for governor in 2023. There were articles in the media canvassing support for Onoh, citing his pedigree as chairman of ECTDA and others. One of Onoh’s promoters argued that 2023 would make it 30 years since Josef’s father, the late Chief C. C Onoh, won election as governor of old Anambra State.

The promoters urged Onoh to complete the aborted administration, to actualise his father’s dream for the people. But Onoh insisted God alone gives power to whoever he blesses with the wisdom of leadership. He said: “I appreciate those  showing concern and support for my political future ahead of 2023 but … 2023 is not my priority. I am more concerned on how to turn around ECTDA to benefit our people. “I urge all who have shown concern to wait for the appropriate time because power comes from God. At the appropriate time, God’s wish will be done. 2023 is still too far to occupy discussions now.”
