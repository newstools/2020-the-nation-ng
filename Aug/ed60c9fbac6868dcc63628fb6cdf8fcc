Late last week, the internet sphere suddenly became buzzed with torrents of comments that were tinged with disbelief and a massive show of empathy when one of Nigeria’s most adored Nollywood stars, Omotola Jalade-Ekeinde, revealed her Coronavirus status. Perhaps to avoid the negative rumours that often follow celebrities like bees to a honeypot, the 42-year-old actress went on Instagram to provide an update on her health, saying she had contracted Coronavirus. “Hello all, I know most of you have been wondering where I’ve been. Well, I contracted COVID. I have been ill in Isolation and now getting better. More details of this soon,” she wrote. Weeks before she voluntarily disclosed her health status, the actress revealed that her pilot husband, Mathew Ekeinde, had flown their children in a private jet from the United States to Nigeria, having been stranded in America since Covid-19 outbreak, which torpedoed global economy and disrupted international travels. This means Jalade-Ekeinde’s was one of 2,630 cases of Covid-19 infections recorded in Nigeria last week (from Sunday, August 9 to Saturday, August 15). Also last week, 32 people lost the battle for life as a result of complications arising from Covid-19 infection; while 2,954 were discharged after they had recovered from their illness. As of August 15, Nigeria had a total of 48,770 confirmed cases, with 36,290 people discharged after recovering from their infection; while 974 deaths recorded so far. A total of 347,545 tests have been carried out as of August 15.  As the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases globally has crossed the 20 million mark, Africa is also not spared. In South Africa where easing of restrictions has been announced to revive the country’s flagging economy after a period of great hardship, it is a case of cautious optimism. Besides having Africa’s highest number of Covid-19 infections, South Africa has recorded more than half of Africa’s coronavirus infections, with more than 570,000 cases and 11,500 deaths to date. This has catapulted South Africa to the top of the global coronavirus table, becoming the country with the fifth-highest number of cases in the world after the United States, Brazil, Russia, and India. However, infections have started to dip in recent days, as the number of new daily confirmed cases had dropped from a peak of more than 12,000 to an average of 5,000 over the past week. Egypt, which has faced criticism over antibody tests for frontline healthcare workers, infection is yet to slow down. With 96,336 confirmed cases and 5,141 deaths so far, Egypt ranks second in the continent in terms of the number of confirmed infections; while Nigeria comes third. In Nigeria, coronavirus cases have been confirmed in 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory.
