 INCUMBENT governments run for re-election on their achievements and records in office, but Governor Godwin Obaseki has only excuses, deceit and blackmail to offer Edo people, the All Progressives Congress (APC) has said. In a statement on Tuesday, the party said Governor Obaseki and the Peoples Democratic Party’s (PDP’s) charge for another four years at the helm had run on lazy gossips and tactless lies peddled in the media to generate sympathy and distract attention from their failures. Mr. John Mayaki, the chairman of the Edo APC Media Campaign Council, who endorsed the statement, said Governor Obaseki was a confused candidate spurned by his closest aides and associates because he lacked administrative skills and frittered away his goodwill on lazy and corrupt endeavours that yielded nothing but worthless Memorandum of Understanding (MOUs).
