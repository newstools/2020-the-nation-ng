There is apprehension among stakeholders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), as the party’s candidate, Mr. Eyitayo Jegede, has kept mum on his choice of running mate. Sources said Jegede has been under pressure to pick one of the governorship aspirants preferably from Ilaje Local Government in Ondo South. It was gathered that the names of Sola Ebiseni and Banji Okunomo were presented before Jegede, but he has rejected them. Aides said Jegede would announce his running mate today, as tomorrow is the deadline for parties to substitute names already submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The Nation learnt that Jegede insisted on picking his running mate from his political family within the PDP. Sources said Benson Amuwa, Jegede’s director of campaign for Ondo South in the just concluded primary election, had been pencilled down. The sources said Amuwa had submitted his credentials and they would be submitted at the national secretariat of the PDP in Abuja today. Amuwa is to replace Olumide Ogunje, whose name was earlier submitted to meet the INEC deadline. Another source said Jegede insisted that he could not trust anybody outside his political camp. Jegede had rejected Deputy Governor Agboola Ajayi, who later defected to the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP), expected to become the third force in the state. The choice of Jegede’s running mate, according to a PDP chieftain, might cause implosion in the party.
