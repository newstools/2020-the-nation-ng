A traditional ruler in Ogun Rasheed Sholabi has been arrested for allegedly defiling his 15 -year- old daughter. Sholabi, who is Baale of Oose Agbedu Ajibawo in Owode-Yewa area, was arrested after the daughter reported at the Owode Egbado Police station he has been having sex with her since she was 11. She told the Police the sexual affairs with the father have affected her private part, making it difficult to control her urinary system. The girl also told the police she lost her mother when she was barely two and the father did not allow her to know her maternal relations, explaining she was left with the option than to live with him. She told the Police the unfortunate situation gave the father an unhindered opportunity to sexually abuse her routinely until her incontinence condition developed and had to report him to the Police. Ogun Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, disclosed this in a statement on Thursday. Abimbola, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), stated the Divisional Police Officer for Owode-Egbado, Olabisi Elebute, led detectives to the traditional ruler’s Palace and arrested him. The Baale, who initially denied the allegation, fainted later when confronted by the victim and one of his ex-wife, who corroborated the victim’s ordeal. He was taken to the hospital where he was resuscitated. His ex-wife informed the police she caught him while in the act, explaining it was why she walked out of the union. The victim has been taken to the Stella Obasanjo motherless baby home, Abeokuta, for safety. Commissioner of Police Edward Ajogun has ordered transfer of the suspect to anti-human trafficking and child labour unit of the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (SCIID) for further investigation and diligent prosecution.
