Former Nigeria international, Tijani Babangida  has offered tips  to FK Tirana coach Ndubuisi Egbo as the Albanian champions begin their campaign in the 2020/21 UEFA Champions League (UCL) today against Dinamo Tbilisi of Georgia. Egbo set a record as the first African coach to win a  league title in Europe when he recently led FK Tirana to their first league crown in over a decade. Babangida, the former Ajax winger,  admonished the former  Super Eagles goalkeeper to adopt the right strategy and tactics to ensure  a positive  result  in their first leg away tie in Tbilisi. “We are happy for Egbo for making Nigerians proud in Albania and he debuts in the Champions League as a manager for his club, I want to advise him to ensure that he gives his players the right pep talk and also supply the right tactics to beat their opponents in Georgia,” Babangida noted. FK Tirana are yet to advance beyond the UCL  qualifying round and they will be relying on their Nigerian coach to provide the Midas touch that will take them to as far as possible this term.
