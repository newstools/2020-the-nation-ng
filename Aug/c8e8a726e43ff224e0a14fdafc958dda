 ALL Progressives Congress (APC) in Cross River State is to elect a substantive chairman, it was learnt. The party, at a meeting of the State Working Committee (SWC) last weekend, resolved to replace the late Matthew Achigbe, who died in November 2018, with a nominee from Obubra Local Government.

He promised wide and universal consultation to perfect on the peace and reconciliation process.
