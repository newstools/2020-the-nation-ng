The state government has spelt out some protocols to be followed for any school to reopen for exit pupils. Affected schools are CAC Grammar School, Ondo Road, Akure and Akure Academy, Oba- Ile. Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, Mr. Akin Asaniyan, said the schools were closed for not complying with all the COVID-19 protocols.

Therefore, the schools will remain sealed until basic things are put in place.” “This issue of COVID -19 is unusual and strange trend and very dangerous issue, which needed prompt attention because it involves lives,” he said.
