Imo State will begin mass testing for COVID-19 on September 1, it has been learnt. Commissioner for Health Dr. Damaris Osunkwo, who addressed reporters on Thursday, thanked Governor Hope Uzodinma for his commitment to the fight against Coronavirus. He urged health workers not to relent in their efforts. She hoped the mass testing would enable the state achieve its aim of testing at least one per cent of its about six million population. According to her, the action was in line with directives from Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). She added that arrangements had been concluded for mobile laboratories to alternate between local government headquarters to test about 500 persons in each council. She said: “We will continue to do our best to look after the people. We urge our people to get tested for free, starting September 1. The test is voluntary…”
