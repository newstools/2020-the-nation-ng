There is apprehension among stakeholders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as its governorship candidate, Barr. Eyitayo Jegede, runs against time to pick his running mate. Party sources said Jegede has been under pressure to pick one of the governorship aspirants preferably from Ilaje local government in Ondo South. It was gathered Sola Ebiseni and Banji Okunomo were presented before Jegede but he rejected them. Close aides said Jegede would announce his running mate on Monday. Tuesday, August 18 is deadline for political parties to substitute names already submitted at the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). It was gathered Jegede has insisted on picking the running mate from his political family within the PDP. Sources said Benson Amuwa, Jegede’s Director of campaign for Ondo South, in the just concluded primary has been penciled down. The source said Amuwa has submitted his credentials and would be presented at the National Secretariat of the PDP on Monday. Amuwa is to replace Olumide Ogunje whose name was earlier submitted to meet the INEC deadline. Another source said Jegede insisted that he could not trust anybody outside his political camps. Jegede had rejected Deputy Governor, Agboola Ajayi, who later defected to the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) touted as the third force in the state. The choice of Jegede’s running mate, according to a PDP chieftain, may cause implosion within the party.
