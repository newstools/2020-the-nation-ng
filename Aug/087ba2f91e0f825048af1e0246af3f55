 KANO State Government has terminated the contract for the construction of the Dawakin Tofa 5km dual carriageway with Rocad Construction Nigeria Limited. The project is now re-awarded to Messrs CCECC Nigeria Limited at the cost of N651.8 million. Commissioner for Information Muhammad Garba told reporters that the Rocad Construction Nigeria Limited who was given the contract in 2012, with KNUPDA as the supervising agency, abandoned the project midway. “The situation caused many hardships to the people of the area.” Garba said the Exco also constituted a committee to assess the 5km dual carriageway projects in the local government areas of the state. He noted that the decision was taken as part of efforts to evaluate, redesign and complete or terminate any contract awarded by the government. Garba said the committee assessing the road project is chaired by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Works and Infrastructure and representatives of the state Urban Planning and Development Authority (KNUPDA). He added that the ministry for local government will determine the extent of execution of the project and payment made to the contractors handling it. Garba said that the council approved the adoption of the Revised Estimated Total Cost of the contract amounting to N26.8 million and the augmentation of N15. 6 million, being additional cost in the contract for the repair works at the dilapidated Bagauda Bridge along Wak-Tiga Road in Bebeji local government area. He stated that another contract, which was initially awarded to Messrs Bindigari Construction Limited in 2014 at the cost of N11.2 million, which included reclamation of eroded sections and provision of retaining wall at both wings, has also not been completed.
