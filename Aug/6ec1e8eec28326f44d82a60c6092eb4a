Oyo Governor Seyi Makinde has declared the Western Nigeria Security Network codenamed Operation Amotekun will not be under the control of the Federal Government. Instead, he said it will be fully owned, managed and controlled by the State Government. He also gave a marching order to caretaker council chairmen in to set up security committees in their various domains to tackle the spate of insecurity in the state. The Governor spoke during a meeting with caretaker chairmen and chairpersons across the 33 Local Government Areas and 35 Local Council Development Areas of the state. The meeting, which started around 6:15 pm and lasted for about 90 mins, was attended by top government functionaries in the state. Makinde said: “From where we are here, the biggest challenge that we have seen so far is in the area of security. Even here in Ibadan, two days ago, a gentleman lost his life very close by here. He went to the bank and they trailed him and for a small amount of money, he got killed. “Yes, we are entering the ember months in a few days now and it is always the season when people who haven’t worked through the year but would want to have a Merry Christmas so we expect that we see a spike in criminals activities. “At Okeho the other day, armed robbers went and rob a bank but thankfully the community rose to the occasion and they assisted to apprehend those people and they combed the forest and that is why I will continue to say and I am saying it for the whole world to hear that Amotekun is here to stay with us and it will not be under the control of the Federal establishment. It will be under our control. “Security of our people is extremely important and nothing can take place as far as we are concern in an atmosphere of insecurity and Oyo state is a very large area.”
