Osun State Governor Adegboyega Oyetola on Thursday inaugurated an advisory committee to fight crimes against women and children. At the committee’s inauguration in Osogbo, Oyetola said the initiative was his administration’s commitment to ensuring a deserved place for women and children. He added that the committee would give the government a framework for a holistic management of gender-related crimes in a way to protect women and children. The governor, who decried the surge in violence against women and children, said: “This inauguration is in furtherance of our efforts at ridding our state of crimes; delivering peace to our women and children, ensuring their fundamental human rights and sustaining our profile as the most peaceful state in Nigeria. “Women and children constitute a huge percentage of our population and are critical to our socioeconomic development. They must, therefore, be protected from molestation, rape and other forms of violence. They must also be well positioned and encouraged to play these critical roles in our collective interest as a people.” Speaker of the House of Assembly Timothy Owoeye said the Assembly had passed a bill prescribing life imprisonment for rapists and 14 years’ imprisonment for attempted rape.
