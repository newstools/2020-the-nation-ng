 Nollywood actress, Omotola Jalade Ekeinde, also known as Omosexy, on  Saturday said she tested positive for COVID-19. The 42-year-old actress broke the news on her Instagram handle where she told her fans that though she is getting better, she is still in isolation. She said:  “Hello all, I know most of you have been wondering where I’ve been. “Well, I contracted COVID. I have been ill, in Isolation and now getting better.” Omotola also revealed that while in isolation, she has been reading. Commenting on one of the touching stories she read recently – the death of Immaculate Okochu, who was crushed to death in Lagos, months to her wedding, Omotola called on Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, to take action that will stop such incidents. “I have read the devastating news of how our youths are needlessly dying and getting crushed by trailers/containers! This is disheartening and has made my heart really troubled! This can happen to ANYONE and Enforcements can’t be taken lightly on this Gov @jidesanwoolu!!! Please do something,” she wrote.
