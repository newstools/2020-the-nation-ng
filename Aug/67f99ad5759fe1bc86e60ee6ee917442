Ederson Moraes played a key role in Manchester City’s 2-1 win over Real Madrid in the first leg of the Champions League Round of 16 at the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu. His footwork gave his team the upper hand as he perfectly executed Pep Guardiola’s plan to feed Gabriel Jesus with long balls. Gilberto Lopes was the man who first took note of Edeson’s skills in Sao Paulo and he recalled the time when the Brazil international begged to not play between the goalposts. “He told me: ‘no professor, not goalkeeper, I want to play in my place at left-back,” Gilberto told MARCA. “It was normal, [as] he was nine years old and at that age what most of the boys want is to score goals and play as outfielders. Gilberto also revealed that there were those who teased young Ederson because of his physique. “He was very thin,” Gilberto added. “That’s why they started jokingly calling him ‘the fat one’. “He hit the ball very hard, but technically he wasn’t very good. parents were present. They were from an area with houses where many had no roof. “His father got up very early, at four in the morning, to deliver boxes of fruit. “Sometimes he would help him. “Now he is the most expensive goalkeeper in the world and he has forgotten some of those things. “He promised us things that, let’s say, he hasn’t fully complied with. “I haven’t spoken to him in a long time. Guinness world record Ederson’s powerful left leg gave him a Guinness plaque which decorates his house. In May 2018, he had three attempts to kick a ball beyond 75 meters and he managed to send it 35cm beyond.
