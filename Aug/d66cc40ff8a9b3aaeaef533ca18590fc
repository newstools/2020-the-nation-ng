 Music superstar, Daniel Oyebanjo, aka D’banj has said he is also into farming. He said this following his decoration at the weekend by the Nigerian Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC) Commandant General, Abdullahi Mohammadu, as an Agro-Ranger. The Agro-Rangers programme inaugurated in mid-2016 is expected to forestall attacks on farms, boost farmers’ confidence to work on their farms without fear and to enhance FG’s food security plan. The Koko master crooner said having farmed for over 15 years, he understands the challenges suffered by farmers, noting incessant and re-occurring attacks stifle production and productivity. He commended the Federal Government for its Agro-Rangers initiative undertaken by the NSCDC. In a statement by his Corporate Manager, Mr Damien Okoroafor, D’Banj, said he would dedicate his life and personal effort to put the country and the NSCDC on the global map and ensure that the insecurity challenges suffered by Nigerian farmers would be a thing of the past.  He said: “I find this initiative undertaken by the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps as a wonderful opportunity to serve my country. “Organisations or agencies such as the NSCDC need the support of the general public to do so effectively since they were established to protect Nigerian citizens. “Being myself a farmer of over 15 years, I very well understands the challenges suffered by farmers as incessant and re-occurring attacks stifle production and productivity,” D’banj said. NSCDC boss Mohammadu said the Agro-Rangers initiatives was part of President Muhammadu Buhari’s strategy to protect lives and property of farmers, create jobs as well as guarantee food security in the country. He urged D’banj to always promote the initiative as government had concluded plans to employ young and agile people in the 36 states of the country including FCT, as Agro-Rangers.
