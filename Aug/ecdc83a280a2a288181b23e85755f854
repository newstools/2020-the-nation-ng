Despite its disastrous ending, Leicester City’s 2019/2020 season was pretty spectacular all things considered. After several years of bold claims and bluster following their impossible 2016 title win, the Foxes finally made good on their promise to break up the Premier League’s big six by securing a fifth placed finish. The promise of Europa League football puts them in a strong position during an important transfer window. With a resurgent Arsenal, an ambitious Everton and a vengeful Wolves breathing down their necks, the Foxes can not afford any recruitment slip ups. One area that needs upgrading is centre-back and a ghost from transfer windows past has been frequently touted as one of Brendan Rodgers’ top targets. In the immediate aftermath of Harry Maguire’s sale 12 months ago, Leicester turned their attention to several Premier League stalwarts. Nathan Aké and Lewis Dunk were targeted with both Bournemouth and Brighton demanding ridiculous money for their star defensive assets. Another well known face on the club’s radar was Burnley’s James Tarkowski and reports suggest that the Foxes will once again make a ploy for the Englishman in the next month. Tarkowski is in the top ten centre-backs in the country, make no mistake. Since signing from Brentford in 2015 he has developed into the Clarets’ leading light, helping Sean Dyche’s side to work miracles on a shoestring budget. He is an imperious stopper and while other centre-backs are more technically gifted, few can hold a candle to him when it comes to bread and butter defending.
