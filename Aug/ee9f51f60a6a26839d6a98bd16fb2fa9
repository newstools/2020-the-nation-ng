 FOUR ex-police officers who allegedly tortured one Chima Ikwunado to death in Rivers State have been arraigned. The defendants were arraigned before Justice Florence Fiberesima of the State High Court in Port Harcourt, the state capital, on Thursday for torture and murder, among other charges. The suspects pleaded not guilty. The court ordered that the suspects be remanded in the custody of Special Anti-robbery Squad till the next hearing. The defendants, while serving in the E-Crack Special Squad of the police command, arrested Ikwunado and four others for a traffic offence, and detained them in a cell where they were allegedly tortured by the defendants until Ikwunado died four days after.  .
