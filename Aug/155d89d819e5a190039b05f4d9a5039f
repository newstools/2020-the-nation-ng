Edo State All Progressives Congress’ (APC’s) Media Campaign Council has tackled Deputy Governor Philip Shaibu over “frivolous” allegations against the former National Chairman of APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole and the party’s governorship candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu. It expressed surprise that Shaibu, the running mate to Governor Godwin Obaseki of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), could accuse Oshiomhole and Ize-Iyamu of plotting to harm him, thereby calling for their arrest. The campaign council, through its Chairman, Prince John Mayaki, in an online statement, noted that hard campaigns would win elections, not dark plot to arrest opponents.
