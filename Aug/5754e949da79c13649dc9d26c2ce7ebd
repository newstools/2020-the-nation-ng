Mandatory Computer-Based Test (CBT) for candidates applying for teaching jobs in Oyo State public schools will run from August 11 to 15, between 7am and 6pm. Chairman of the Teaching Service Commission (TESCOM) Akinade Alamu warned that those unable to upload their credentials on TESCOM’s portal before August 11 should not bother to sit for the test. Alamu, who was on a radio programme, assured applicants that their results will be communicated through their registered email addresses and SMS. He said: “The examination will hold from August 11 to 16, starting daily from 7am till 6pm. Results will be communicated to the applicants through the email they put in their registration and through SMS. “No applicant’s complaints will be attended to at the CBT centres; if anybody has complaints, let them come to the TESCOM office. We wish them the best in the examination.”
