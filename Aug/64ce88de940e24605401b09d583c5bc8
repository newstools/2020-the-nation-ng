A woman was on Friday burnt beyond recognition while three others sustained  severe injuries when a truck conveying petroleum products exploded at Irete Junction area of  Owerri West Council Area of Imo State. The incident happened at about 10: 45am when the driver of the truck was trying to make u-turn after discharging the liquidified natural gas at a petroleum station  along Owerri -Onitsha express road. According to an eyewitness, the incident occurred   when a vehicle marked  XY 933UNW carrying full load of pineapples from the Onitsha to Owerri lane rammed into the truck and exploded. The woman, the witness said was trapped in the vehicle screaming while passersby watched helplessly until she was completely burnt. It was gathered that the driver escaped with severe burns while two other cars caught  in the incident were burnt to ashes before the state fire service team arrived at the scene. The eyewitness blamed the fire service personnel for arriving at the scene late, adding: “By the time they eventually arrived,  it was difficult to open the vehicle in which the woman was trapped.” The Fire Service Director, Jephet Okereafor,  said they responded immediately to stop the fire from causing more havoc  but lamented  that they lacked other fire fighting equipment.
