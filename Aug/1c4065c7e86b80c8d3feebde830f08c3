The Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics (ASUP) has petitioned the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) over 20 months’ unpaid salary by Abia State Governor Okezie Ikpeazu. National President Anderson Ezeibe, in a letter to NHRC’s Executive Secretary, said Ikpeazu refused to pay its members in the Abia State Polytechnic, Aba. He said: “Our members in this institution, covering all teaching staff of the polytechnic, are owed salary from July 2018 to October 2019 and from March to July 2020. “This is despite several entreaties to the polytechnic administration, Governing Council and state. Since the escalation of COVID-19, our members have not received any salary, and have been living in discomfort. “This development is a violation of the fundamental rights of our members, particularly as it affects their rights to just and favourable conditions of work. “It also undermines their rights to life and dignity of the human person, and by extension their dependents access to same rights. “We pray the intervention of the commission by compelling Ikpeazu to release the 20 months’ arrears. The government should also ensure forthwith regular payment of salary of these workers in line with the terms of their engagement.”
