Closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage has reportedly exposed a 30-year old man simply identified as Jomaph, as the rapist of an 11-year old girl in Sapele, Delta state. The incident reportedly happened last Wednesday morning. Although details surrounding the incident were not clear as of the time of filing this report, it was gathered that the victim was assaulted when she went to use a convenience. However, she returned minutes later, crying that she had been abused by the suspect, said to be a neighbour. Jomaph was said to have denied violating the young girl and sought the arrest of the victim and her family members. Unfortunately for him, a CCTV camera installed by another neighbour for business, reportedly exposed him in the act. The Delta State Police Command confirmed the incident, Tuesday to The Nation. The Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Onome Onowakpoyeya, who noted that she was yet to get official statements of the case, said “the incident happened in Sapele. They said, initially, the man denied, until they brought the CCTV footage and so, he owned up. “They are trying to compile the case appropriately and transfer to the State CID.”
