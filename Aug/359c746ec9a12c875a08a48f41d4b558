The Financial Markets Dealers Association of Nigeria (FMDA) has faulted a report published in one of the national dailies, claiming that it signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with four professional bodies to float the Chartered Institute of Securities and Investment of Nigeria (CISI). In a statement, FMDA said: “We wish to strongly state our utmost displeasure in the incorrect presentation of facts as this misrepresents the position of the Financial Market Dealers Association (FMDA), which has been clearly stated and communicated to the Chartered Institute of Stock Brokers (CIS)  to the effect that the association will not accede to signing the MoU from the Chartered Institute of Stock Brokers. This is for clarification and record purposes to the general public and all stakeholders,” it said. The FMDA was created to develop financial market infrastructure, human capital and promote professional and ethical standards in treasury. While the FMDA has reviewed its journey at periodic intervals vis-a-vis its goals, one clear objective that cuts across the past and the future is the growth and development of the financial markets as well as the protection of the interest of its members in the exercise of their dealing/trading activities including its value chain.
