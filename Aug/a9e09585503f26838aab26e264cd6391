 THE Digital Switch Over (DSO) rollout is critical to the post-COVID-19 prosperity of the creative industry, Minister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed has said. Mohammed said the stalling of the programme has deprived the country of its economic benefits. The minister, who spoke during the Digiteam meeting yesterday, said: “But if indeed there is a good time to resume the DSO rollout, it is now. Why? Because moving ahead with the DSO is critical to the post- COVID-19 prosperity of the creative industry, hence it is being taken as a priority of this ministry. “On our part, we have made tremendous progress in our efforts to get the much-needed funds for the DSO process, in particular, to pay outstanding debts that will ginger stakeholders to resume the rollout and bring the massive benefits of the DSO to Nigerians. “As I speak, we are putting finishing touches to a memo we plan to send to the Federal Executive Council as part of our relentless efforts to secure the funds to re-start the process, and we are very optimistic that our efforts will pay off soon.”
