Huge crowd gathered at the secretariat of the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) in Akure to join the Ondo State Deputy Governor, Agboola Ajayi who declared for the party on Friday. Agboola resigned from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in June and joined the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) where he failed to secure the party’s ticket. He left the PDP to pitch tent with the ZLP having been promised the party’s governorship ticket. His name has been submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as the party’s candidate. Agboola told the huge crowd that he is running from one political party to another
because of the people. He said he was in the race to give hope to the hopeless and restore good governance. The Ondo Deputy Governor urged his supporters to get their voter cards as well as defend their votes on Election Day. He assured the supporters that any planned rigging of the October 10 polls would fail. State Chairman of the ZLP, Hon Joseph Akinlaja, charged the people to return to their wards and begin massive mobilisation for the party. He said the ZLP would be victorious at the polls.
