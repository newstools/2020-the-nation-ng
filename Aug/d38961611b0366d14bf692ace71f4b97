Chairman of National Campaign Council of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Governor Nyesom Wike, has accused the All Progressives Congress (APC) of scheming for cancellation of the Edo governorship election. The Rivers Governor alleged APC was not ready for the Edo poll and had resorted to underhand tactics to compel the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to halt the poll midway. The Governor said intelligence report revealed as part of the plan, the APC intended to cause and sustain violence that could stop the poll and cause constitutional crisis in Edo. He insisted the plan was to create a scenario that would lead to the expiration of Obaseki’s tenure before the conduct of a fresh poll in the state. He called on the police and other security agencies to use the Edo poll as a template to redeem their image. He said: “The police are supposed to use Edo election to clear their name and regain the confidence of the people. “We have enough intelligence on what they want to do with the security in the election, but we will scuttle it. “APC wants to ensure enough violence in the election. Like the Chairman of INEC said that the election will be stopped if there is violence. They want to cause violence so that the election will stop. “They are not interested in election, so that INEC will stop it and then wait till November when Obaseki’s tenure will end. “It is a calculation that they do not want the election to hold because Edo people are tired.” Wike said it was wrong to describe Obaseki as an ungrateful person because he had proven to be a man of good character. He said: “Obaseki is morally qualified and stands out as the best candidate for the September 19th 2020 election.”
