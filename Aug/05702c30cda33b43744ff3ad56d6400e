AS part of activities to mark his one year anniversary as the Olowo of Owo, Oba Ajibade Ogunoye has inaugurated a 137-member Owo Development Council (ODC). The ODC is to help actualise his vision for the development and growth of Owo kingdom. Oba Ogunoye said members of the ODC were selected based on merit, experience and accomplishment in their chosen career. The monarch urged the members to see their selection as a call to serve humanity even as he enjoined Owo indigenes to support the project. He said ODC had been divided into committees as regards human endeavour, to ensure effectiveness. Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, a member of the council, noted that communities would get the needed development if sons and daughters pulled their resources together. He advised his kinsmen to support him in the October 10 governorship election and ensure he is re-elected. Other members of the committee are a former deputy governor of Osun State, Mrs. Titi Laoye Ponle, Elder Simon Olakunri, former Senate president Senator Bukola Saraki, Sir Patrick Tayo Asida, among others.
