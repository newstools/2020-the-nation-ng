Nigeria’s COVID-19 Case Fatality Rate (CFR) is continuously declining, the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 said on Monday. The PTF at its briefing in Abuja said the decline has been consistent for four months. It added that sample collection across the country remained low and challenged state governments to ramp up testing. PTF Chairman and Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) Boss Mustapha said the country crossed the 1,000 fatality mark at the weekend, noting that this should be a reminder of the dangers facing humanity. “The PTF has however continued to study the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and we note that it has been on a steady decline over the last few months: April 30: 3%; May 31: 2.8%; June 30: 2.3%; July 31: 2.0%; and August 22: 1.92%. “We are however convinced that our sample collection is still low. We therefore encourage States to ramp up their testing and to declare correct results because early detection will ultimately translate to treatment and ultimately levelling of the curve. “Last week Thursday, we informed you that Nigeria had crossed the 50,000 mark of confirmed cases. Yesterday Sunday, 23rd August, we reached the unenviable record of 1,000 fatalities. “We wish to restate that these records are not just numbers as they vividly remind us of the dangers that we still face. May the souls of all those that have lost the battle against CVID-19 rest in peace,” he said.
