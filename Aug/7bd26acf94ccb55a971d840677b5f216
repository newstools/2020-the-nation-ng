Chelsea have confirmed the signing of veteran centre-back Thiago Silva as the Brazilian defender makes the move to Stamford Bridge after departing Paris Saint-Germain. Silva’s move to Stamford Bridge comes after his eight-year PSG stay came to an end following the club’s loss to Bayern Munich in the Champions League final. The 35-year-old, who served as captain in that defeat, departs the French side with a joint-record seven Ligue 1 titles as well as five Coupes de la Ligue and five Coupes de France. During his time in Paris, Silva made a total of 315 appearances, including 21 this season as PSG won a domestic treble. Silva, who makes the move on a free transfer, has now joined Chelsea on a one-year deal with the option of extending that deal by one further season. He becomes Chelsea’s fifth major signing of the window, with Hakim Ziyech, Timo Werner, Ben Chilwell and Malang Sarr already snapped up. In addition, the club has already completed the signings of Malik Mothersille, Jimi Tauriainen and Xavier Mbuyamba this summer. Blues director Marina Granovskaia told the club’s official website of landing Silva: “We are delighted to be able to add a player of Thiago Silva’s proven world-class credentials to our squad. “Having performed at the highest level for many years, we have no doubt his experience and quality will complement the many exciting talents we already have here. “Thiago will be an excellent fit and we hope he can add some new trophies to his impressive list of honours.”
