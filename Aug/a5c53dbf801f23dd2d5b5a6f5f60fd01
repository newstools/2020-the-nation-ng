Lagos State Government will from tomorrow begin  crackdown on illegal abattoirs and slaughter slabs. It said the move was to curb unwholesome processed meat and meat products. Acting Commissioner for Agriculture Ms Abisola Olusanya, who announced this after inaugurating the Monitoring, Enforcement and Compliance (MEC) Team of the ministry at the weekend, said the action became necessary to guarantee wholesomeness in the process of meat consumed by Lagosians. She insisted on closure of illegal slaughter houses, saying they were a concern for the environment. Olusanya said the ministry had identified 50 illegal abattoirs, adding that none of those facilities shut down before would be reopened. She said there were illegal and clandestine slaughter houses across the state, urging whistle-blowers to assist the government by reporting them to the task force. Among authorised abattoirs in the state are Abattoir and Lairage Complex, Agege; Achakpo Mechanised Abattoir, Ajegunle; Ologe Mechanised Abattoir, Badagry (under construction); Matori Slaughter Slab; Itire Slaughter Slab; Ilaje Slaughter Slab; Ikorodu Slaughter Slab; Badagry Slaughter Slab; and Epe Slaughter Slab.
