Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, is dreaming to succeed Didier Deschamps as France coach. According to Zidane, coaching the national team is something he’d welcome. He said: “I said so here, a dozen years ago: if I am a coach, why not one day coach the France team? “This is nothing new. Even Didier Deschamps knows it because he was the one who announced it. “We all have a story and I, the story with the France team, it was great until my last match. “With ups and downs, but my story has been beautiful. If one day it has to continue, it will happen naturally. But this is not the news. What will happen will happen.”
