The Civil Society Organisations in Defence For National Security has accused some unpatriotic elements of planning to breach national security because of hatred for President Muhammadu Buhari. Those involved in the plot, according to the group, have engaged on sustained vilification of security agencies despite the current administration’s efforts. At a peaceful solidarity rally at Unity Fountain in Abuja, the group called for the cessation of further vilification of security agencies in the interest of national security and appreciation of the gallant efforts and sacrifices of security operatives. Addressing newsmen shortly after the rally, Comrade Joe Mesele, urged Nigerians not to abuse the freedom of expression to pull down the country. He said: “They just want to destabilise our national security and consequently destroy Nigeria because of their hatred for Buhari. To these groups of people we want to remind them that Mr. President’s tenure is just three years but Nigeria remains till God calls. So will you because of three years pull down the nation on all of us? “We have heard some Governors and individuals making reckless statements, some even treasonable. Yes we know and support freedom of expression which is paramount but will you in the name of freedom of expression destroy the nation that gave you an identity? “We believe that Nigeria is passing through a trying time that calls for men of goodwill to stand to be counted. And it so happened that God made it possible for President Muhammadu Buhari to be at the helm at this point in time. “To this end, what is required of Nigerians as patriotic citizens is to give Mr. President all the support he needs not because you like him but for the sake of our nation and future of our children. Mesele observed the Buhari administration “is winning the war against insecurity and all is needed is for Nigerians to accord the security agencies due support.”
