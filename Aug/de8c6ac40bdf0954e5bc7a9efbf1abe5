Minister of Works and Housing Babatunde Fashola, says the building of Loko-Oweto Bridge across River Benue offers a shorter route for travellers, reduced travel hours and facilitated redistribution of wealth in the local communities. Director of Press in the ministry Boade Akinola stated this on Sunday. Akinola said Fashola remarked during an inspection tour to the project with his counterparts from Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Relations Minister, Sen. George Akume. “It provides a shorter route cutting off about four to five hours. “For someone coming from Cross River to Abuja by road, ordinarily will have to go from Calabar to Ikom, Ogoja to Katsina-Ala and then join Markudi, come through Lafia then Keffi and Akwanga into Abuja; but now you have a bifurcation through Oweto to Nasarawa. “Apart from the Loko-Oweto bridge project, work is ongoing at the 2nd Niger Bridge, the Ikom Bridge and 37 other bridges across Nigeria are being built, repaired or rehabilitated by the Ministry.” Fashola said some of the bridges being built, rehabilitated and repaired were: the 3rd Mainland Bridge in Lagos, the Murtala Mohammed Bridge in Koton Karfi and the Isaac Boro Bridge in Port Harcourt.
