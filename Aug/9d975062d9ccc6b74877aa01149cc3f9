Operatives of Delta State Police Command have nabbed a 33-year-old alleged serial rapist following a manhunt. The alleged rapist was identified as Dominic Daniel Okwekwe, CP Hafiz Inuwa said. The Nation gathered that the suspect who resides at No 44 Oji River road, Enugu State was arrested weekend in Asaba- the Delta State Capital after several months on the run. The suspect, who is currently in police custody, specializes in luring ladies into hotels and raping them. Inuwa said the alleged rapist makes pornographic videos of their sexual acts while also robbing them of their hard earned money. Inuwa while speaking with reporters Monday said,” We have equally arrested a serial rapist who used to get ladies to a hotel, hide them, rape them, then do pornographic videos of the act and rob them of their hard earned money. “He will hold them hostage like kidnapping and then, he will open their handsets and force them to transfer money into his own account. We have arrested him and investigation is ongoing.”
