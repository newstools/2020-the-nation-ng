The Joint Health Sector Unions (JOHESU) has appealed to the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, to intervene in its demand for immediate payment of all outstanding welfare entitlements of its members by the Federal Ministry of Health. In a letter to the Minister, the union expressed disappointment over the long delay in addressing the lingering welfare challenges of its members. It said the situation arose from non-adherence and outright violation of judgments, collective bargaining agreements and Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) by the Ministry of Health. The union said: “JOHESU specifically demands that the Federal Ministry of Health be compelled to immediately set up the reflected structures in line with the National Industrial Court of Nigeria (NICN) judgment and the Central Internship Placement Committee for all eligible health professionals. “Also, the Federal Ministry of Health should liaise with relevant administrative officers to effect payment of promotion/skipping arrears.” The body further demanded the setting up a staff audit committee, which will include JOHESU members, to critically examine concerns of understaffing and irregular employment affecting members. It called on the Ministry of Labour and Employment to as “matter of utmost urgency begin the processes to implement the 30th September 2017 agreement on adjustment of CONHESS Salary Structure.”
