Wife of the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate in the Edo State, Professor Idia Ize-Iyamu Monday said that Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu will fight the infrastructure battle, if elected. She said dilapidated structures dotting public institutions across the state, especially in the health and education sectors, and poor implementation of Women Empowerment Programmes, investment in Agriculture and Functional Security Architecture, will be a thing of the past. Professor Idia Ize Iyamu was addressing APC supporters in Ward 12, Oredo Local Government Area, who were in wild jubilation at the visit of the incoming First Lady. She said functional and affordable Infrastructure, which are the highlights of her husband’s manifesto, christened: ‘Simple Agenda,’ would guarantee development and the general well-being of the populace. Prof. Idia Ize-Iyamu took the constituents round the rudiments of proper voting process to ensure they vote for the right Candidate and passionately appealed to them to vote for her Husband to sweep out the bad government that has punished them in the last four years. Chairman of Oredo Ward 12 APC, Ernest Edebiri welcoming the campaign team assured them that they were set to vote out the bad government of Obaseki on September 19th. The director general of APC women campaign council, Rt. Hon. Elizabeth Ativie on behalf of the party, received hundreds of Members of PDP and other Parties who defected to APC at the Campaign grounds
