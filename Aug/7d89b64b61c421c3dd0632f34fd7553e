The inferno that gutted a new generation branch at Victoria Island, Lagos, started from a diesel tanker discharging its content near the powerhouse, The Nation has learnt. The tanker with registration number AKD637XP and a parked vehicle marked AKD234FA were completely burnt Wednesday morning after the 33,000 litre capacity truck suddenly went up in flames while offloading its products in the bank’s storage. It was however unclear if the vehicle’s ignition was on or whether it had leakage that might have triggered the fire which escalated to the bank’s building.  According to the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), the fire which started around 11 am, was contained about 45 minutes later and stopped from spreading further into adjoining structures. Director General (DG) LASEMA, Dr. Femi Oke-Osanyintolu said there was no death nor injuries, adding that dampening of the area was ongoing. “A combined intervention of emergency responders from LASEMA Response Team, Eko Hotel, Lagos Fire Service, UBA Fire Service and Federal Fire Service was able to arrest the inferno and stop it from escalating further the building in the premises.  “No loss of life recorded.
