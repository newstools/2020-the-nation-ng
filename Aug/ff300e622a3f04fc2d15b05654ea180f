National Institute for Research and Development (NIPRD) Director-General Dr. Obi Adigwe has bemoaned the lack of investment, funding and prioritisation of research and development pertaining to African traditional medicines. He noted that developing traditional medicines research has the huge potential for health and socio-economic development for Nigeria and the African continent. In a statement to commemorate this yearâ€™s African Traditional Medicine Day, he called for the involvement of philanthropists, foundations, development partners and other private sector actors in the area of research and development of traditional medicines in Africa.
