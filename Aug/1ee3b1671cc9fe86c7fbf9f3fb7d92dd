  Vee has revealed she thought Bright O was gay due to his non- challant attitude towards getting “involved” with a lady in the house. She spoke while advising Wathoni to flirt with Bright O and nothing more. Vee argued Bright O doesn’t really care about having a relationship in the house which could be why he is relaxed.  He had told Dorathy he liked her but didn’t go further. “There was a time in the beginning I almost thought Brighto was gay because he was so laid back and reserved,” said Vee.
