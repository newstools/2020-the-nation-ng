The family of the former Premier of defunct Western Region of Nigeria, Chief Samuel Ladoke Akintola (GCON), has praised President Muhammadu Buhari for naming the Omi Adio (Ibadan) Railway Station after their late patriarch. In a letter jointly signed by Ambassador Abayomi Akintola and Dr. Abimbola Akintola, the family expressed appreciation for the honour done to their father, “even after over 50 years of his death. This is, indeed, a great honour to our family”. The family also acknowledged what it called the “many good works” President Buhari is doing for the country. Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr Femi Adesina, quoted the letter in a statement on Monday in Abuja.
