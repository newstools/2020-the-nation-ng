 IMO State will partner Polymer Institute of Nigeria to shore up job creation processes and bring prosperity to the people, it was learnt. A statement by Governor Hope Uzodimma’s Chief Press Secretary, Oguwike Nwachuku, said the government would take advantage of the institute’s readiness to make waste management a source of economic prosperity for the state, especially through the teaching of Polymer Technology at Imo State Polytechnic. Uzodimma, who addressed a delegation from the institute yesterday, hailed them for pushing through the Chartered Polymer Institute of Nigeria bill awaiting presidential assent. The governor directed Office of the Deputy Governor to work with the group on how to maximise opportunities at the polytechnic by including Polymer Technology in the curriculum. Uzodimma said the group should liaise with the Ministry of Environment on issues and programmes concerning waste management. National President Prof. Paul Mamza said they were in Imo to see how they could establish a partnership with the government to create jobs through self-employment. Mamza said the Institute had developed elaborate proposals on the utilisation of local raw materials for commercially-viable products to boost the economy. Such materials could  produce foams, paints, adhesives, pigments, fibre-reinforced polymers, among others, Mamza said.
