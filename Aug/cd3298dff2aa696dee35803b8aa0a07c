 MEMBERS of the Unity Forum of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ondo State have dissolved the body and blended into the campaign team of Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu. The forum, headed by former deputy governor Alhaji Ali Olanusi, was formed following the inability of stakeholders in the Ondo APC to resolve their differences after the election of Governor Akeredolu in 2016 and the conduct of the congresses. It had vowed to ensure Akeredolu did not return for a second term, but internal wrangling within the forum and the crisis of a consensus aspirant caused division within its ranks. The dissolution of the forum followed the steps taken by Governor Akeredolu to ensure the party goes into the electoral battle united. At an enlarged APC stakeholders’ meeting in Akure, the party leaders, especially governorship aspirants in the forum, agreed to work for Akeredolu’s victory. Olanusi, who was present at the meeting, said he was on board the campaign train of Governor Akeredolu It was the first time Olanusi would be in a solidarity meeting with Akeredolu in the past three years. The governor urged leaders and members of the Ondo APC to work for the success of party. He hailed the resolve of party leaders to work as one indivisible party with one united purpose and sole mission to win elections to remain in government. Akeredolu said the new spirit in the party must not dwindle, but must continue to soar.
