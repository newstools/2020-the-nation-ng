The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has activated 112 free emergency call numbers in Kogi State. This was confirmed in a statement issued on Friday in Lokoja by the private firm managing the emergency numbers on behalf of the NCC in the state, SOLSAN Technology Ventures Ltd. Mr. Shola Ajayi who signed the statement said that the emergency code which can be dialed from any telephone or mobile hand device was activated in March. He said that 112 is a short code assigned by the NCC for all manner of emergencies, including armed robbery attacks, kidnapping, accidents, fire outbreak, flooding, banditry and vandalisation. “When calls are received by the 112 agents, they are usually escalated to the correct agency responsible for such emergency. “The emergency communication project is a non-commercial collaboration project between the Federal Government, through the NCC, state government, telecom companies, security agencies and power companies,” he explained. He listed the telecom companies under the arrangement as MTN, Airtel, Glo, 9Mobile, adding that the collaborating establishments are contributing to the 112 emergency code as part of their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) commitment to the society. According to him, the 112 code is strictly for emergency calls, and not for “prank callers.”
