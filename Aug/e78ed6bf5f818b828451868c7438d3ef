 FUJI singer, Sulaimon Alao Adekunle aka Alao Malaika, has said his new movie project, ‘Alao Oje’ is unique. Malaika, who is presently promoting the movie project revealed that one of the reasons his new project is unique is because of the role he played. Malaika said: “It’s something different and explicit from me to my amazing fans both home and abroad.  “I have featured in a couple of movies. But this is different! You know why? Because it’s an epic movie that is also going to be produced by me. This is something I have never done before. So you all should keep your fingers crossed and wait on it for me to blow your mind.” Malaika made his debut in a film over a decade back and has featured in a number of films.
