 BORNO State Governor Babagana Zulum on Monday swore in Prof. Isa Marte as the Chief of Staff (CoS), and Abba Sadiq, a member of the Judicial Service Commission. Zulum said the appointments came after careful, diligent considerations and wide consultation. He said the appointments were in recognition of individual credentials, proven capacity, records of integrity, passion for selfless services and dedication to duties. The governor urged the appointees to use their rich experience to complement the good governance vision of his administration. He also paid tribute to the late CoS, Babagana Wakil, for his selflessness in actualising the policy and plans of his administration. Marte thanked the governor for the confidence reposed in them. He described Governor Zulum as a leader who always thinks of his people and tries to find a solution to the problem in the state with a view to developing and uplifting the lives of the people. â€œZulum is a people-centred leader, a man who fears God, which is very important in leadership calling. If you look at his vision and mission, we share a lot and once this is followed, Borno State will come out as the best.
