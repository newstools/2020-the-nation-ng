Ruggedman has defined his relationship with music rave, Naira Marley, saying they aren’t friends. In a recent interview with The Nation, Ruggedman stressed that he has no relationship with Naira Marley because they are not friends. “There is no relationship.” The rapper, however, said they are merely colleagues because they both operate on the Nigerian entertainment and music scene.  “We are colleagues because we are not friends. We are colleagues, I’m friends with who I’m friends with and I’m colleagues with the ones I’m not friends with because we are all into entertainment does not mean we are buddies,” he stated. On his relationship with entertainers, especially the young folks, Ruggedman insisted he’s colleagues with them and has only a few friends. “What I have for everyone whether you are into entertainment or not is respect, I’m not about because you are buzzing and I come and run to you no. I respect myself a lot and I respect everybody so I’m cool with everybody that is cool with me and I respect everybody that deserves my respect,” he reiterated.
