Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has inaugurated a 953-member local campaign committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC). He urged the members to go to their wards and units to campaign for the success of the party in the October 10 election. Akeredolu, who performed the inauguration in Akure, said he expected victory in the 203 wards. The governor, who dismissed talks that only those named in the campaign committee would be given appointment, said those that did not make the campaign list would still be recognised after electoral victory. Former Deputy Governor of the state, Alhaji Ali Olanusi, another former Deputy Governor, Alhaji Lasisi Oluboyo, Chief Olusola Oke and Mr. Isaacs Kekemeke said they would work for Akeredoluâ€™s success at the polls. Akeredolu on Wednesday urged APC members to shun violence during the coming governorship election. He gave the advice in Akure at the inauguration of the Akeredolu/Aiyedatiwa governorship campaign committees saddled with the responsibility of ensuring victory of APC at the polls. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that 14 committees were inaugurated for the re-election bid of the governor. Akeredolu said there was no reason to display any act which violated the rights of any citizen.
