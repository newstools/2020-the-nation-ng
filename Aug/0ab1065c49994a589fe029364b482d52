In order to curb the challenges diminishing the growth of advertising in Nigeria, members of Outdoor Advertising Association of Nigeria, OAAN and other key stakeholders in the Nigerian marketing communications industry have reiterated the need for the Nigerian government to constitute a board for the Advertising Practitioners Council of Nigeria, APCON. This was part of the highlights at the OAAN’s 35th Annual General Meeting tagged, ‘OOH Business and Emerging Realities’ held virtually. Addressing the meeting, Emma Ajufo, the OAAN President said that the association organised the virtual AGM in line with the new normal, adding that the webinar would welcome and apply all creative contributions and recommendations made by participating practitioners and stakeholders in the advertising sub-sector given the mounting challenges posed by the global coronavirus pandemic. The APCON Acting Registrar, Mrs. Ijedi Iyoha, during her presentation, thanked the OAAN leadership and captains of other sectoral bodies who were present at the meeting for living up to the billing despite the daunting challenges presented by the pandemic. On his part, Jude Odia, the Managing Director of Starcom Media Perspectives, emphasised on audience measurement, stating that for Nigeria’s out-of-home to take pride of place in the advertising sub-sector, accurate measurement technology must be put in place. Corroborating Odia’s position on audience measurement, the President of Advertisers Association of Nigeria (ADVAN), Bunmi Adeniba called on the industry practitioners to embrace data-driven marketing, adding that accurate measurement, especially in the out-of-home, will help to drive growth in Nigeria’s SMEs sector.
