The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Edo State has said it is committed to a peaceful election. It said it would ensure that residents had good health. Publicity Secretary Mr. Chris Nehikhare, who spoke on Sunday in Benin at a media briefing to appraise the party’s campaign tour since its beginning on August 3, said the campaign tour was being carried out ward to ward. He added that the idea was to ensure that the COVID-19 guidelines were adhered to in order to prevent its spread. Nehikhare said gathering people in one place would expose them to infection from COVID-19, which was a threat. He said despite the ward to ward approach adopted for the campaign, it had been successful. The publicity secretary said PDP and its candidate, Governor Godwin Obaseki, were received with enthusiasm in the wards so far visited. He said the campaign council began its campaigns in Edo North Senatorial District, which had 64 wards out of the 192 wards in the state. “We have as at today, completed our ward to ward campaign in 64 wards. Although at some point, we had to suspend campaign due to the House of Assembly issue. “But we have returned to complete campaign in the four wards, which were affected then.”
