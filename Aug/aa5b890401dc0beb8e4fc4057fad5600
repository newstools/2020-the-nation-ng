Kano State Government has approved the establishment of a Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB) Computer-Based Testing Centres (CBTCs) in the five Emirate Councils and 44 local government areas. The centres would serve as board’s zonal offices. Commissioner for Information Muhammadu Garba, who briefed reporters in the State House, said the approval to establish JAMB centres in Kano was made at the State Executive Council (SEC) meeting. He said the Exco also approved the establishment of State Council on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to ensure grassroots people have ICT skills. The council on ICT will be co-chaired by the commissioners of Science, Technology and Innovation and that of Local Government. The commissioners for Information, Education and Higher Education, as well as chairmen of the 44 councils, will serve as members. “The need for an increase in the number of CBTCs is informed by the increasing demand; we want to stop the situation where candidates have to be sent to neighbouring states of Bauchi, Kaduna, Jigawa, Katsina, etc to seat for JAMB papers.”
