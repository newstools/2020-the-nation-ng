Kidnappers of a 60-year-old farmer, Nyieda Kpeenu, have contacted her family, demanding N16milion ransom to set her free. Kpeenu was abducted from her house at Nweol community, Gokana Local Government Area, Rivers State, by unidentified gunmen who whisked her away to an unknown place. The son of the victim, who spoke in confidence, said the kidnappers struck at about 8 pm on Wednesday, seized their mother and took her away. He said the hoodlums shot into the air many times, unsettling the community before kidnapping their mother. “They forced the house of our mother open and took her away. It was a disturbing scene. They further created tension by not calling us two days after the incident. They later contacted us and demanded N16million ransom. “Where do we get such money from?  My mother is not a politician. She is a farmer. We have reported the matter to the police, but nothing has happened. We are praying to God to touch their hearts so they can release our mother unconditionally, ” he said. When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer, Nnamdi Omoni, said the matter had not been reported to his office. He, however, promised to contact the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) in charge of the area for confirmation.
