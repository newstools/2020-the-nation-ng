Efe Ajagba said he was on  track to being one of the best in the heavyweight division after changing his management team in a deal that would see him showcase his boxing skills at major sports networks across the world in the future. NationSports had announced last month a change in Ajagba’s camp when he  became the latest to join the growing stable of high-powered boxing manager James Prince, who had managed Floyd Mayweather Jr. early in his career. The former Olympian signed with Bob Arum’s Top Rank Boxing and will be making his debut on ESPN later this year. The Nigerian heavyweight prospect previously was promoted by Richard Schaefer’s Ringstar Sports and fought on Al Haymon’s Premier Boxing Champions cards. Ajagba also confirmed in the announcement that he has changed trainers, from the legendary Ronnie Shields to Kay Koroma who trains former IBF/IBO/WBA light middleweight champion Jarrett Hurd and is an assistant trainer for former WBO featherweight champion Shakur Stevenson. “I made this decision to become a better boxer and to advance my career,” Ajagba said. “That’s why I signed with James Prince and Top Rank.”  “When I return to the ring soon, you will see a new Efe Ajagba. Kay Koroma and I are working on my head movement and defense, as I seek to become a more well-rounded fighter.”
