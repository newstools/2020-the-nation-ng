The Coalition Against COVID-19 (CACOVID), a private sector-led initiative against the coronavirus pandemic, has launched a new safety campaign and palliative distribution as the group continued to collaborate with the government in the fight against COVID-19. At the launch of the campaign themed ‘Coro Must Go’, CACOVID also announced plans to distribute food palliatives to about 10 million Nigerians as part of efforts to cushion effect of the pandemic on households. Chief Executive Officer, Aliko Dangote Foundation (ADF), Zouera Youssoufou, said  during the campaign  face masks would be distributed and reawaken Nigerians consciousness on how to protect themselves from the virus. She said the group was concluding arrangements to roll out palliatives to vulnerable households in Lagos in the coming week. She stressed that Nigerians must as a matter of necessity wear a face mask to protect themselves and others since it is globally recognised and approved as a strategy for curbing the spread of the virus. “We are creating awareness as you know that there was a misconception that COVID-19 was only attacking wealthy people but the truth is that community transmission is happening amongst us and so there is need to do the needful which is wear our masks, sanitise our hands and try to keep to social distancing,” Youssoufou said.
