The Lagos State government has directed JSS3 pupils registered for the Basic Education Certificate Examination (BECE) organised by the National Examinations Concil (NECO) to resume Monday August 10. The examination starts August 24. However, the Lagos State Education Commissioner, Mrs. Folasade Adefisayo, said in a statement by the House, Public Affairs, Lagos State Ministry of Education, Mr. Kayode Abayomi, those JSS3 pupils registered for the BECE conducted by the Lagos State Examinations Board (LSEB) are not to resume yet. “Only those students who are registered for NECO BECE which is scheduled to commence on the 24th of August, 2020 are permitted to resume,” she said. She noted other JSS3 students writing to write the BECE organised by the LESB would soon be informed of the scheduled dates of their examination. The Commissioner urged administrators in both public and private schools to ensure full compliance with the COVID-19 guidelines for schools re-opening in their schools. She noted that government’s officials would move round to monitor compliance levels. She counseled students and members of staff to practice regular hand washing hygiene, use face masks and maintain physical distancing, while adding schools must ensure soap, water, sanitizers and thermometers are available.
