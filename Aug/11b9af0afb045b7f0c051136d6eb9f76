Osun State has appealed to former N-Power teachers, who taught exit classes, to resume in helping pupils prepare for Senior School Certificate Examination (SSCE). A statement by the governor’s Senior Special Assistant on Special Intervention Programmes, Lukman Bello, said no sacrifice was too much for the future of the pupils. The statement reads: “Sequel to an appeal by the Commissioner for Education, Folorunsho Bamisayemi, that all N-Power teachers, who were directly teaching SS3 classes in our public schools to return for revision classes, I appeal to the affected former N-Power volunteers in Batch A and B to please honour the government. No sacrifice is too much for the future of our children.”
