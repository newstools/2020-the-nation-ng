Governing Council of The Polytechnic in Ibadan, Oyo State, has approved the promotion of outstanding workers in all cadre. Council Chairman Prof. Kunle Akinyemi, after the maiden meeting yesterday, said: “We already approved the promotion of members of staff and made some landmark decisions. Your prayers will energise us and Oyo State will be better for it. That is big enough in terms of the decision we have taken. “We have also decided on the 50th anniversary celebration; whether it will be 50 plus one celebration, we will let you know.” The chairman solicited media cooperation to enable the institution reach heights not witnessed before. “But there are few other things we will like to do in terms of infrastructural improvements, academic enhancement, student-teacher relationship and peace on the campus…”
