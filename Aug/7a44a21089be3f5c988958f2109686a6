 PASTOR Osagie Ize-Iyamu, the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the Edo Governorship election, has congratulated striker Victor Osimhen over his record  $96million transfer deal to Napoli. The 21-year-old, who hails from Edo State, is the Italian club’s latest addition following the completion of a deal which makes him the club’s record signing and Africa’s most expensive football player. In his congratulatory message, Ize-Iyamu described the move as a deserving success for the “talented and hardworking Victor Osimhen who stopped at nothing to make his dreams come true.” He said: “In Victor Osimhen, we find the deep well of strength and single-minded devotion that is symbolic of the Edo character. These and more are the qualities that propelled the young talent into limelight. And if there is better news, it is that from his example, we can draw and get convinced that such excellent qualities are deposited in us all.”
