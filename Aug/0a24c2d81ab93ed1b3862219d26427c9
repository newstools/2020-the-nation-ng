Politics in Bauchi State is currently front page news as Governor Bala Mohammed and former House of Representatives Speaker, Yakubu Dogara, continue their face-off. Dogara recently parted ways with the governor and PDP after months of internal bickering. Sentry gathered the disagreement between the two erstwhile allies may have turned a blessing in disguise for the ‘innocent’ people of Dass/Tafawa Balewa/Bogoro Federal Constituency represented by the legislator. Sources say since the Mohammed/Dogara face-off started, people in the constituency have been smiling home with largesse being showered on them by the feuding politicians and their supporters, all in a bid to win and or retain their loyalty as the crisis rages. Checks indicate that a good number of PDP leaders and members in the area will soon follow Dogara into APC. This is something the governor and his allies in the area will not have happen. During the week, some politicians from Dass/Tafawa Balewa/Bogoro Constituency paid a solidarity visit to Mohammed in Bauchi. It is needless to say they went home smiling after assuring the governor they remain loyal to him. Sentry also gathered that PDP faithful in the area were ‘well taken care of’ by the government and party in commemoration of the Sallah celebration. Also, Dogara and his allies are said to have concerned themselves with the welfare of both PDP and APC members in the constituency unlike before.
