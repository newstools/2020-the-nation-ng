Ex-Head of House, Lucy has expressed her determination to ensure the 15 Housemates lose the fifth-week wager challenge. Lucy’s anger stemmed from Kiddwaya’s stand on how Housemates should give their all to the wager challenge scheduled for Thursday night. In her fit of rage, Lucy told Wathoni and Praise she cares less about the wager task but self-respect. Lucy, who was the Head of House for week two, said she won’t have Kiddwaya and Erica disrespect her just because of the position he occupies. She bluntly told Praise and Wathoni she would ensure the Housemates lose the wager for the fourth time – having won it once in the last five weeks. Although Kiddwaya had called for a truce and apologised for his words and the tone he used with the Housemates, it is unsure if Lucy has accepted the apology. Lucy has recoiled into her shell and even had a confrontation with Prince earlier on Day 31. She had told Prince to stay on his line and not talk to her if possible. Prince was Lucy’s Deputy during her reign as the Head of House in the second week of the show.
