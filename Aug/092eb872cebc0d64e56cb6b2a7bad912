 THE newly-elected Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr. Fatai Adams, has vowed to lead the party to victory. Adams, the former deputy chairman, defeated Dennis Arole at the state congress. Addressing supporters after assuming office, Adams said his election was borne out of the commitment of members for a united PDP dedicated to all citizens. He said the collective desire for good governance would be achieved through members doing the right thing at the right time with the right motive for the good of the least of all. Adams promised to continue the legacies of the PDP founding fathers whose efforts and sacrifices, he said, birthed an indestructible political legacy that would transcend generations. He said: “My fellow compatriots, I salute your resolve in the face of intimidation, harassment and blackmail by the soon to be removed APC government, to ensure that our state is liberated from the unproductive maladministration called the APC. I assure you of my firm resolve to do all I can as your chairman to ensure that our party, the PDP, wins the next election.”
