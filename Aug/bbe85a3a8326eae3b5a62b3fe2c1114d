Samson Oti Nigeria-born striker Ugochukwu Oduenyi has vowed to keep challenging his potential for bigger chances after his club Ried SV got automatic promotion from Austria Liga 2 on Friday. The lanky striker is delighted to be part of the historic team that lifted Reid back to Austria Bundesliga and will be hoping for a greater challenge next season. The 24-year-old has been getting attention from major clubs having played a limited number of games in the concluded season through injury. Oduenyi’s speed and drive has become a huge advantage and one of the reasons scouts are waiting to declare interest in a perfect move for the Nigerian-Festac based player. “I feel great and excited to be part of the history even though injury denied me some chances but I am glad to be in the team,” said the ecstatic Oduenyi. The Reid striker reflected on the team success following the last day demolishing of their opponents 9-0 to crown as champions of the Austria Liga 2. “We have a good team and we focused only on getting the ticket, that is to be in the Bundesliga and every player was committed to achieving that goal. This is a club with “good history”. “The club doesn’t belong in the 2.liga from the way we trained to the way we prepare for games, and this club belongs in the Bundesliga. “The spirit of the team was great, we had a great team with top professionals, we worked hard as a group and did what the coaches wanted from everybody, and today, we made ourselves proud and made the club proud as well. “For now, I am still a player of Ried SV and my dream is always to express myself at the top levels. Hard work and dedication has helped me so far but I want to keep challenging myself for bigger chances.” Clubs from France, Belgium, Norway and Denmark are already monitoring situation of the bully striker, who has a similar playing style like Roman Lukaku of Inter Milan.
