Barely two weeks after the immediate past Speaker  of  the House of Representatives, Hon. Yakubu Dogara, defected to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) party, his ardent supporters in Bogoro Local Government Area which forms part of his constituency have also dumped the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Recall Dogara, who represents Dass/Tafawa Balewa/Bogoro Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, left the PDP following a fall out with the state governor, Sen. Bala Mohammed. An elated APC Chairman in Bogoro LGA, Haruna Rikayar, while receiving the defectors yesterday assured them  that they would  be treated equally as he boasted that the APC would regain back power in the state, starting from the local government elections billed to hold in October 2020. The defectors, who were led by Bulus Iliya, who is a loyalist of Dogara and who is also aspiring for Bogoro chairmanship in the coming local government elections, said they have decided to retrace their steps and come back home. Iliya said his decision to return to the APC was informed by the need to be united with his political godfather, vowing to remain loyal to him. This is as he charged Governor Bala Mohammed to be just and fair in the conduct of the local government council election in the state. Bulus Iliya, who regretted formerly being in the PDP, said the  Dogara-led caucus were sidelined and were not given recognition.
