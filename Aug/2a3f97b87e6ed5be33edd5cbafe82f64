Super Falcons captain  Asisat Oshoala has reacted after her team Barcelona Femini lost to German side Wolfsburg to crash out of the UEFA Women’s Champions League on Tuesday. A solitary strike from Fridolina Rolfo, during the match at the Anoeta Stadium in San Sebastian sent the German outfit through to the finals and prevented the Catalans from reaching the finals for the second time in two years. Barcelona were runners up last year where they were trashed 1–4 by France champions Lyon. Nigeria’s Asisat Oshoala and her teammates were made to pay dearly for their poor clinical finish as Barca had 16 attempts on goal but only once managed to test Wolfsburg goalkeeper Friederike Abt, who saved a header from Oshoala in the first half. The ball had appeared to deflect off the hand of Wolfsburg defender Kathrin Hendrich, but the Spanish side’s appeals for a penalty kick were ignored. “Unlucky yesterday(Tuesday)  but I’m super proud of this team. MY TEAM ALWAYS,” Oshoala tweeted yesterday. The four-time African Women’s Player of the Year was in action for 65 minutes before being replaced by Aitana Bonmati.
