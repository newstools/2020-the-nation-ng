Oyo State House of Assembly has confirmed the appointment Dr. Abdullateef Idowu Oyeleke as the new Commissioner for Environment and National Resources in the state. The confirmation follows a request by Governor Seyi Makinde to fill the vacuum created by the death of the former Commissioner, Mr Kehinde Ayoola. Responding to questions during Tuesday plenary from the Deputy Speaker, Hon. Mohammed Fadeyi, Majority Leader, Hon. Sanjo Adedoyin and Hon. Wumi Oladeji, the commissioner designate assures that he will key into environmental development plans of the state governor, particularly on the rehabilitation of dump sites and waste to wealth initiative. While decrying the indiscriminate disposal of refuse on the water ways and median of the roads in the state, the commissioner designate expressed his readiness to work with the recently inaugurated environmental task force by the governor to make environmental offenders to face the consequences of the actions. Reeling out his plans on the waste to wealth management, Oyeleke said since Governor Makinde has already approved the rehabilitation of dump sites in the state including turning waste to wealth, he will ensure full implementation of the plans to boost the stateâ€™s Internal Generated Revenue (IGR). He established that all illegal structures, shops and kiosks erected on the water ways and by the road sides will be looked into to ensure safe and healthy environment. Dr. Oyeleke added that he will make sure that the ministry is proactive to its tasks, and ensures that all agencies and task forces under the ministry work together to achieve better results. The Commissioner designate was born in 1969 in Atiba Local Government area of Oyo State and was the immediate past Chairman, Oyo Community and Social Development Agency (OYCSDA).
