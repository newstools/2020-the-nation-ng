Ronald Koeman, strongly tipped to be the new Barcelona boss, says he would like the job but that nothing has been finalised yet. The 57-year-old, who is manager of the Netherlands, is set to join the La Liga runners-up this week. When the former Barca player was asked if he wanted to return, he said: “I’d like to, but it’ll only be confirmed once I’ve signed the deal. “Until then, I cannot say any more about it – even though I’d like to.” The former Dutch international had been speaking to reporters outside the national team’s headquarters on Tuesday before flying to Barcelona. Koeman played for the Catalan giants between 1989 and 1995, helping the club to four league titles and the European Cup. His contract with the Dutch FA runs until the 2022 World Cup. (BBC)
