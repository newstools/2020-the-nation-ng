 THE vacation judge in Cross River State, Justice Elias Abua, has recused himself from a suit to stop Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) from holding its congress on Saturday. Otu Marshall; Terence Orok; Raphael Ntui and Henry Edem challenged the inauguration of ward and local government executive committees by the national body without the input of the state executive. They feared the same list would be relied upon by the national body in conducting the state congress on Saturday; hence they sought an injunction stopping the national body from using any list, except that of the Edim Inok-led state executive. After listening to the motion, Justice Abua recused himself from the case and returned the file to the Acting Chief Judge, Justice Maurice Eneji, for reassignment. He said: “I am a man of integrity; I have worked hard to earn my reputation and wouldn’t want to spoil it for any reason. I would return the case file to the acting chief judge for reassignment.”
