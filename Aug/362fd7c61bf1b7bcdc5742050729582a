New Barcelona coach Ronald Koeman has told legendary striker Luiz Suarez to leave the Spanish giants. Koeman, who took over following a disastrous 8-2 loss to Bayern Munich at the quarter-finals of the Champion League, has been given sweeping powers to decide incoming and outgoing players as the club looks to rebuild. He reportedly called Suarez on Monday to deliver his leave verdict. Aside from the 34-year-old Uruguayan, other superstars that will leave include Ivan Rakiti, Samuel Umtiti, and Arturo Vidal. The four players have been reportedly told the new coach does not count on them for the next season. Barcelona President Bartomeu had said there would be “tough decisions” after the loss to Bayern. He also stated it was time for some players, who have contributed for years to leave, sparking fear of massive overhaul in the team.
