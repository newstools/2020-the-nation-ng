No fewer than six persons including policemen sustained injuries on Wednesday morning as officials of Lagos State Task Force on Environmental Sanitation and commercial motorists clashed at Abule Egba. The fight started after bus conductor was rumoured killed by the task force officials. Police said no one was killed, adding that the violence resulted from a false alarm raised by an errant driver. It was gathered that suspected members of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) attacked policemen with stones, bottles and other objects in protest of the alleged killing of their member. The Nation gathered that about five policemen were injured in the melee. The violence, which spread to  Alakuko and other neighbouring communities along the Abeokuta Expressway, grounded commercial activities as people scampered to safety. Traffic was stalled. Police spokesman Bala Elkana said five suspects have been arrested and calm restored. “Nobody died,” adding that the injured conductor was being treated at an  hospital. But NURTW officials insisted that the conductor died, and that police should say which hospital he was being treated, if he did not die.
