Barcelona have sacked its technical secretary Eric Abidal. This comes one day after Quique Setien was let go as coach. “Barcelona and Eric Abidal have reached an agreement for the ending of the contract that united the two parties,” the club said in an official statement. “The club would publicly like to thank Eric Abidal for his professionalism, commitment, dedication and the close and positive nature of his relationship with all aspects of the Blaugrana family.” It remains to be seen who will take over in the Catalan club’s sporting department and what will happen with Ramon Planes, who led that department alongside Abidal.
