Some student-leaders at various tertiary institutions in Niger State have said the continuous closure of schools, as a result of COVID-19, will affect their academic pursuits. President of the Students’ Union Government (SUG), College of Health Sciences in Minna, the state capital, Maryam Pai, noted that staying at home has been difficult with the academic calendar affected. “I am not finding it easy staying at home, especially when I think of the semester I am  yet to cover. Our school academic calendar has been affected.” As for the SUG President of Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai (IBBUL), Idris Baba Elomi, staying at home has negatively affected him and his academic performance. He said: “This is because all efforts to read through my lecture notes proved abortive.” Muhammad Abacha, the SUG President, School of Health Technology, Minna, described the outbreak of the pandemic and lockdown as unfortunate. He said the novel coronavirus brought along many challenges. He said: “I should have graduated but the pandemic has prevented me from finishing.” According to him, staying at home to prevent the spread of the virus is a welcome idea. “But as a student, I feel bad that our schools are closed till further notice,” Abacha said. Yahaya Abubakar, the SUG President of College of Education (CoE), Minna, appealed to the government to reopen schools, saying the closure has done more harm than good to the education sector.
