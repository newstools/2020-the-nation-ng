One-time Deputy Head of House Prince has opened up to his love interest Tolanibaj on his losses in the last 39 days. After winning the puzzle part of the Pepsi TurUp challenge and losing the second round to TrickyTee and Ozo, Prince pondered the outcome of the task all through the night. Prince became anxious after the Housemates left the Arena for the night. Beginning in the room with Trikytee and Vee, Prince was already taking his losses quite hard. After all the Housemates had settled for their evening work, Prince went to confide in Tolanibaj who had already settled in for the night. Prince told Tolanibaj that he felt like he was always paired with people who did not want to win as much as he did. He confided in her that if he went harder than his teammate, it would not yield them a win either and so pondered what it meant. In the Pepsi TurnUp challenge, he and his partner, Nengi, had planned choreography and decided who would sing which verses. He said that this did not transpire in their performance. Prince also lamented the Head of House games which he kept losing, even though he wants to win. He and Tolanibaj discussed the possibility the HoH games were almost completely based on luck.
