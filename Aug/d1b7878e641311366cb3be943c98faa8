Morocco international center back, Zouhair Feddal, has left La Liga side Real Betis Balompié to join Portuguese powerhouse Sporting Lisbon on a two-year deal. Feddal joined Sporting CP after having spent three years at Real Betis on a reported €3 million fee. “I want to say to the Sportinguistas that I am very happy to be here, and to belong to this enormous Club. The only thing that I can promise is commitment, hard work, dedication and that I will fight to the end. That’s something that I will never lack, and I hope that we can achieve our objectives,” said Feddal. “I know that Noureddine Naybet and Mustapha Hadji played here. This is a very well-known Club in Europe and in Africa. Sporting CP are one of Portugal’s big clubs, and I’m sure that we will reach our targets. I know that I’m at a Club that aims to win, and I want to win big things”.
