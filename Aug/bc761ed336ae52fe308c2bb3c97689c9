Plateau State government has designed modalities for safe reopening of public and private secondary schools. The Nation had reported Federal Government’s directive for resumption of students in SSS3 on Monday to prepare for West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) in the next two weeks. Commissioner for Secondary Education Mrs. Elizabeth Wapmuk told The Nation a committee set up to draw up modalities has concluded its assignment and presented reports to Governor Simon Lalong. “They are awaiting the approval of the Governor, which will confirm the date and details of resumption,” she stated. She said in continuation of readiness for reopening, a team from the ministries of Education, Health and Environment has gone to check public and private schools across the Local government areas. She explained the state has continued to adopt measures to ensure COVID-19 pandemic does not spread when schools resume. The Commissioner added a team has been constituted for monitoring and supervision of schools’ compliance with safety procedures upon resumption. She said teachers, parents and workers have also been trained on ways to prevent and reduce the risk of infection amongst teachers and students. “We are ready to abide by the guidelines to roll out that will ensure the safety of the students, teachers and other stakeholders for a successful resumption,” the Commissioner added.
