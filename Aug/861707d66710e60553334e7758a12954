Kano State government has commenced the fumigation and decontamination of public and private schools in the State to check the spread of corona virus disease. The fumigation is coming after the state government approved Monday August 10 as resumption date for Senior Secondary Schools three (SS3) students who are expected to write their final examination. Deputy Governor Nasiru Gawuna who flagged off the exercise, on behalf of Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, said 199 public schools and 329 private schools are to be decontaminated across in the State. Gawuna said the move is part of the Ganduje administration’s fight against the spread of COVID-19, particularly to ensure that the disease is brought to an end. “What is more interesting is that the fumigation exercise is beginning with private schools that are not under the care of government. This shows the level of commitment of our administration in the fight against covid -19,” he said. He said the Ministry of Environment has been mandated to go to all public places to ensure the places are safe and to educate the people about COVID-19. The deputy governor, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary (CPS), Hassan Musa Fagge, added that the Environment ministry has distributed buckets, hand sanitizers, facemasks and other items to protect people from the virus. He commended stakeholders of the education sector for supporting government policies and actions in tackling the pandemic in Kano. In his address, the State Commissioner for Environment, Kabiru Ibrahim Getso, thanked Kano State Government for its determination to bringing down the scourge of covid-19 in Kano and the nation at large. Commissioner of Education, Muhammad Sanusi Sa’id Kiru, assured that the Kano State Government will fumigate all the schools before the exit students resume.
