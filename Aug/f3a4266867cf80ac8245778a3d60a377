 MEMBERS of the Unity Forum of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ondo State and Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu have reached a truce to work together for the success of the party in the October 10 election. The first runner-up in the APC primary election, Chief Olusola Oke, led the forum members to visit Governor Akeredolu where the truce was reached. No statement was issued after the meeting, but an aide to Oke, Mr. Rotimi Ogunleye, said the discussion was successful. He said the governor accepted the forum’s proposal on the need for stakeholders to work for the party’s victory. Oke told reporters that he and his followers had resolved to remain members of the APC in their wards. He said: “As members, we are interested in a united, cohesive APC where members will be treated as equal, where government patronages will no longer be sectional, where rights and privileges of members will be respected without hindrance. It is not in the interest of any member of our party for this state to slant into opposition. We will do everything possible on our part, subject to conditions and terms to be agreed on. “Our group insists that because of the experience in the past where promises were made and not kept, where people were given assurances, but were denied. It is important that the reconciliation should be comprehensive, involving all the strata of our party. That is the only reconciliation that will instil confidence in our people.”
