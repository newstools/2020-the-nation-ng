 Of the 1,822, 346 registered electorate in Ondo State, only 1,478,460 voters are expected to participate in the October 10 governorship election. This is because 372,888 Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) are yet to be collected. Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) Dr. Rufus Akeju, speaking yesterday in Akure, said the owners of the PVCs refused to collect them despite appeals and awareness for them to collect the cards. He said only those with PVCs would be allowed to vote. Akeju said COVID-19 protocols would be followed during the election.
