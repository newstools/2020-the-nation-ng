The Kogi State government, on Tuesday, repatriated 78 beggars and mentally challenged persons back to their states of origin. Those repatriated are from five identified states in the North, including Katsina, Kaduna, Kano, Bauchi and Zamfara. The Kogi State Commissioner for Women Affairs and Social Development, Hajiya Fatima Kabir Buba, said those affected were evacuated from different parts of the Lokoja metropolis, including the Old Market, Zango, Ganaja village, and Obasanjo square. Buba noted that the evacuation was not to discriminate against them, but to rid the streets of beggars roaming the state capital. She said that the state government will not relent in its effort in getting beggars off the streets of the capital and other parts of Logo State. According to her: “The state government made adequate arrangements to ensure that they are transported to their respective locations with utmost respect and dignity. Before the government transported them back to their home states and local governments of origin with six buses, we took them first to the ministry rehabilitation centre, fed them and provided all the basic needs that will enable them start normal life like every others in the country. “This government is committed to cater for every citizens even though you are not from Kogi State. This action of ours should not be misconstrued. The government under the leadership of Alhaji Yahaya Bello remains committed to providing for the less privilege without any form of discrimination in the state.”
