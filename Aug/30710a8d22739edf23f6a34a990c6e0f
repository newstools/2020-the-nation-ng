 RUSSIA’S sports ministry said on Wednesday it would help its athletics federation pay a doping fine that is a key condition to removing the threat of expulsion by the sport’s global governing body. The Russian athletics federation has been suspended since 2015, and its athletes were barred from the 2016 Rio Olympics. World Athletics said last month it would go further by expelling Russia unless it made an outstanding payment of $6.3 million in fines and costs for anti-doping breaches by August 15. “The Russian sports ministry has made an unprecedented decision to grant the All-Russia Athletic Federation a one-time subsidy to develop the sport, including paying off a debt to World Athletics,” the ministry said in a statement yesterday.
