Ebi Egbe, CEO of Monimichelle Group, has congratulated Dan Amokachi on his new job as Special Adviser (Sports) to the nation’s number one citizen, President Muhammadu Buhari. Egbe in his good will message said Amokachi’s appointment would add value to sports in the country and also make him contribute more positively to the growth of the sector. “I’m happy the President has made him (Amokachi) his SA Sports. Amokachi would add value to Nigerian sports. Combining it with his Ambassadorial role would bring out the best in him,” Egbe said. Egbe charged the former Super Eagles striker to use his position to see that sports get more attention from government, especially at this time in the nation’s history when the youths need to take to sports rather than taking to crime and other social vices. He stressed that PMB has done the right thing by saddling an ex international with the task of being his adviser on sports. “This is putting a round peg in a round hole. I say Congratulations to Amokachi and thank you to President Buhari. This is a development that would lift Nigerian sports,” Egbe stated.
