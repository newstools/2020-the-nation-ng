 FOOTBALL legend Diego Maradona has issued compatriot Lionel Messi with a charity challenge in the fight against COVID-19 According to Mundo Deportivo report, Maradona tasked Messi with a charitable initiative to help with the fight against COVID-19 in South America. The pandemic has shown no signs of slowing down in certain areas of the world, and as a result, Alejandro Dominguez, president of Conmebol, has begun the ‘Together for South America’ solidarity campaign. Maradona is inviting Latin American football’s biggest stars to make donations of important football artefacts, in order to raise money which will be used to help combat the effects of the virus. “CONMEBOL and the national Red Cross societies of its 10 member countries unite to create an unprecedented charity campaign, where all proceeds will be used to recover from the effects of COVID-19,” a statement, published in Mundo Deportivo, read. “Together for South America consists of the largest collection of symbolic objects of soccer (replicas of trophies, clothing of stars of our sport, historical articles) donated by athletes or institutions and that will be drawn before a notary public.”
