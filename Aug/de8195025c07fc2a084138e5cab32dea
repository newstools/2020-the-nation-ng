To celebrate her 24th birthday, Vee got a birthday cake from Big Brother and also a flower from her love interest, Neo. The cake, which was delivered in the storeroom, was picked up by the Head of House, Kiddwaya and Vee’s partner, Neo. During his last diary session, Neo had asked Big Brother for flowers and pen to surprise Vee on her day. With the support of other Housemates, Neo successfully pulled his surprise to Vee with the flowers and cake as other Housemates sang a happy birthday song. He also wrote a short note to his lover to celebrate her birthday. “Happy birthday Shenkese, thank you for every special moment you have given to my boring world in the shortest time. “You give me light with every smile and peace with every kiss. May your days be long and colorful,” Neo wrote.
