 THE governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Eyitayo Jegede, has picked a member of the House of Representatives, Gboluga Ikengboju, as his running mate. Ikengboju represents Irele/Okitipupa Federal Constituency of Ondo State. Jegede settled for Ikengboju after a meeting with stakeholders of Ondo PDP. It was gathered that he rejected entreaties to pick one of the aspirants who contested against him at the primaries. Jegede reportedly told those pressuring him that he needed a running mate he could trust. Some loyalists of the aspirants, who lost at the primary election, said they were waiting for directives to know the next political steps. A socio-political group, the Ondo State Council of Professionals (OSPC), has said it has uncovered plot by politicians to paint Jegede as pursuing what it termed ‘Akure agenda’. It said the politicians planned to create artificial boundary dispute between Akure and Idanre communities. The Coordinator, Chief Cornelius Ayedire, said some politicians had begun erecting signboards on Idanre land with the inscription: ‘This land belongs to Akure’. He said it was the design of those he called “jittery politicians who are threatened by the love for Jegede in Idanre community.” Ayedire, in a statement, urged the peace-loving people of both communities to see those erecting the false signboards as “idle hands in the services of the devil, represented by their political sponsors”. Ayedire said any land dispute monarchs in Akure and Idanre were not aware of could only mean a wicked lie.
