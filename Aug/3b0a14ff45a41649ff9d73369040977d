 THE Wesley University, Ondo has cited the effect of COVID-19 for its inability to clear outstanding salaries and allowances of over 88 of its staff since 2014. The institution is owned by Methodist Church, Nigeria. The university, in a July 14 letter to 89 aggrieved former staff, who demanded payment of their salaries and allowances from 2014 to 2019, said the impactsÂ  of COVID-19 on its finances have made it impossible to clear the debts totalling about N155 million. The aggrieved staff led by professors and a former vice-chancellor, Prof. William Olu-Aderonmu, had demanded their salaries through their lawyer, Mr. Femi Aborisade, who threatened to continue to drag the institution before court of public opinion nationally and internationally.
