Scores of supporters of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Action Democratic Congress (ADC) were injured in a fracas in Ondo West local government area. The clash was not unconnected with the local government elections scheduled for Saturday, August 22. Ten political parties are participating in the election. About 15 vehicles were destroyed in the clash. Ondo Police spokesman, ASP Tee-Leo Ikoro, confirmed the clash and said many wounded persons have been hospitalised. Ikoro said investigation was still on to unravel the cause of the clash. Ondo APC Chairman Engr. Ade Adetimehin alleged ADC members attacked APC supporters campaigning in the area. Adetimehin, who described the ADC as an alarmist party, said it was yet to get over harvest of its chieftains into the APC. He said he advised APC members not to retaliate but report at the nearest police station. The Ondo APC chairman said the party is campaigning with achievements of Governor Akeredolu in infrastructural development, education, health, welfare and employment of young graduates. Officials of the Ondo ADC were yet to react at press time. The Nation had reported a faction of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in Idanre local government pulled out of the local government poll over violent attacks on its members.
