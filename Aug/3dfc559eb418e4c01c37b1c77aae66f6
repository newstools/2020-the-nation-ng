 THE Akwa Ibom state government has challenged the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) report listing the state as the second with highest unemployment rate in the country. Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Comrade Iniobong Ememobong in a statement on Saturday queried the credibility of the ‘Labour Force Statistics: Unemployment and Underemployment Report,’ released by the NBS. Ememobong argued that the NBS report does not represent the current reality going by the number of industries operating in the state coupled with the number of indigenes recruited in the state civil and public service. “The reality on ground in our state is in contradistinction to the Bureau’s report. As a responsible government, we intend to engage the National Bureau of Statistics, to ascertain the veracity of their processes and results. The role of data in a survey is to reflect the existing reality, not to project the imaginary,” he stressed.
