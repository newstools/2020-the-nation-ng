Afrobeat singer, Seun Kuti, has said that young people engage in criminal activities to be accepted in society. Seun, son of late Afrobeat legend, Fela Anikulapo Kuti, made this statement during a live session with comedian, Woli Arole on Instagram. He noted that rich people use their wealth to overpower young guys by spending lavishly on their women and in turn, the young guys engage in criminal activities to fit into the same society. “Rich people in Nigeria are so morally and ethically bankrupt, that they chase young girls a lot. So they corrupt a very important process in the development of the society”, Seun stated. “When young men and women can interact with each other mutually between those ages of 18 and 26. You find out that the rich big men take the young nice girls who are supposed to start a life, network, and plan but they will bring themselves from their fifty-something years old and dive into this circle and be spending dollars on all these girls. “It is impossible for you to now tell young boys not to try to regain control of their self-esteem especially when the country is silencing them because of poverty. So this is where many young African people are willing to do crime. They do crimes because they need to feel accepted by society. They need to be heard, they need to build relationships and you know it’s not cool in Nigeria to be friends with poor people”. Seun has taken after his late father as a talented musician and social activist. He has continually spoken against corruption and dared top Nigerian dignitaries and politicians.
