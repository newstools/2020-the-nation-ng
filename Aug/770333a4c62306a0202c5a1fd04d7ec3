 A Customary Court sitting at Mapo in Ibadan on Tuesday dissolved the 14-year-old marriage between one Dauda Saliman and his estranged wife, Amina over her attempt to poison the husband. President of the Court, Chief Ademola Odunade and two other arbitrators said the union was dissolved in the interest of peace and tranquility. He granted custody of the three children produced by the marriage to the respondent and directed the petitioner to pay N15,000 as their monthly feeding allowance in addition to being responsible for their education and other welfare. Odunade frowned at Amina’s attitude of allowing her husband to stay in a hotel for three years without crying out about it, describing her as “the architect of her own misfortune”.
