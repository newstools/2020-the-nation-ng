Super Eagles coach Gernot  Rohr  said the 2020 UEFA Champions League (UCL) semi-final  pairings are mouth-watering ties  that would be a spectacle to watch even as he backed his former German Bundesliga side, Bayern Munich, to go all the way. The interesting semi-finals to be played as one-off match in Portugal   will see a German Bundesliga  side  tango against a French  Ligue 1 side  as PSG  and RB Leipzig  clash tomorrow at The Estádio da Luz in Lisbon; while Bayern Munich tackle Lyon at  the Estádio José Alvalade on Wednesday. “ As a Franco-German ( general laughter)  I’m very happy  with the semi-final fixtures  because which way you look at it, I’m going to be a winner, “ the 67-year-old  former Bayern Munich defender  told NationSport. “ But my heart will be for Bayern Munich, my former club of course;  and I’m happy that three of the four coaches in the semi-finals are Germans. “This  means we have good school  and coaching  tradition  in Germany; and I’m happy for Bayern coach Hans-Dieter “Hansi” Flick who is my personal friend; and also know the two other  German coaches  too (Thomas Tuchel of PSG ; and Julian Nagelsmann of Leipzig). “ They all made good impression in the quarter finals with their tactics as well as substitutions ;  and I think the semi-finals are going to be pleasant to watch.” While  Tuesday’s clash between PSG  and RB Leipzig  would be their first ever  in an European competition,  Wednesday’s fixture between Bayern and  Lyon  will be  their ninth encounter in European competitions  but Rohr  said it was painful no  Super Eagles is in any of the final four teams. “ The semi-finals are interesting but I regret there is no Super Eagles  in any of the semi-finalists  but we I’m happy there is Joshua Zirkzee Who is a Dutch-Nigerian with Bayern and Ademola  Lookman who is British-Nigerian with Leipzig,”  noted Rohr  who also featured for French club, Bordeaux in his heyday.
