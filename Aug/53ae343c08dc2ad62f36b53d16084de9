The first Head of House Nengi doesn’t seem to hope on getting anything from Ozo if he possibly becomes the Head of House for the second time. The two were having a discussion when Nengi said she doesn’t think she stands a chance to be chosen as deputy Head of House if Ozo becomes the HOH again. “You are a hopeless case for me. The people that I was even having hope for, most of them have gone,” said Nengi. “You are out of my hope list. In fact, for now, it is only myself I have because right now most of the people are booed up, they are just removing people from my booless gang”. “Why did you say you are hopeless?” Ozo asked “For me, if you win Head of House I have no hopes”, she replied. Ozo replied “I need to start calling you king manipulator. Unfortunately, things like that do not work for me. But if it is the other way round I don’t feel that hopeless”.
