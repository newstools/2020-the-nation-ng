The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) said on Tuesday that it was ready to conduct a free and fair election in Ondo State. It said the October 10 governorship poll would be devoid of malpractices. Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) Mr. Rufus Akeju, speaking at the opening ceremony of a three-day advocacy and voter education training for youths, cautioned them against being used for thuggery and violence before, during and after the election. He said the commission was focused on the poll with renewed vigour on voter education, adding that the election would be conducted in line with international best practices. Akeju said: “I assure you that INEC is determined to conduct a free, fair, credible, conclusive and acceptable election in line with international best practices. “The commission is working hard towards eradicating the ‘do or die’ attitude, vote buying menace as well as the high level of apathy associated with the electoral process.” The Executive Director, Pacesetter for Development of Rural Communities Initiative, Mr. Obatola Jonathan, said the programme was organised to train select youths, who would educate others on why they must participate peacefully in the coming election.
