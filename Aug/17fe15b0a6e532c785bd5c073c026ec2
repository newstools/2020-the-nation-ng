Immediate past Head of House Kiddwaya has told the other 13 Housemates he is only in Big Brother show for fun and nothing serious. He said this while reacting to Lucy’s outburst after losing the Pepsi Turnup challenge on Wednesday. Kidd and Lucy were paired to perform DJ Cuppy’s Greenlight but they lost to Ozo and Trickytee, who won N1million naira each and an all-expense-paid trip to Dubai. Speaking to other Housemates, Kidd said he knows his worth and wouldn’t drag anything with Lucy. “Now let me be honest with you, I know what my life is outside this house. I’m just here for the fun of the game and I don’t really take anything here seriously. People outside know what I do and what I’m capable of. “No one here really knows me that’s why I’m just quiet and don’t talk much here because when I get to the outside you gonna know.”
