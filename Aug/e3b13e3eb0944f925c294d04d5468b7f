Medical students from eight tertiary institutions in the Southeast geopolitical zone will be competing for Literary Award under the educational programme of Onyebuchi Chris Ifediora (OCI) Foundation, a non-governmental organisation. President and founder of OCI, Dr. Chris Ifediora, said in Onitsha, Anambra State that the maiden programme tagged: Literary Award for Medical Students (LAMS) was to improve medical students’ literary skills. He said eligible students would write an essay titled: Back to the Future aimed at preventing a pandemic in future. He said: “The Centre for Disease Control predicts that another pandemic might hit by 2035; thinking back to 2020, the essay seeks to know measures that could be put in place to ensure that the devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic does not reoccur. “Submitted essays of between 800 and 1,000 words would be assessed by a panel of judges made up of students drawn equally from each of the medical associations within the institutions. “The judges would look out for creativity, relevance to the theme, originality, grammar and spelling.” He said the top three winners would be rewarded with cash prizes. Ifediora, a practising physician in Australia, said that literary skills among doctors could unlock huge potentials that significantly complement medical practice. “The foundation’s decision to support the medical students via the LAMS Initiative is an easy one, given that the founder was an alumnus of NiMSA at the Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka,” he added.
