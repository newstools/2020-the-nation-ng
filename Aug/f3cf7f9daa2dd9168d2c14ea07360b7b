 IJAW Youths Council (IYC) Worldwide has urged International Oil Companies (IOCs) in Niger Delta to fulfil their obligations to host communities, especially ones contained in their Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs). Chairman of IYC (Eastern Zone) James Tobin, who spoke in Port Harcourt at the weekend, said the council had reports of firms abandoning promises in Global Memorandum of Understanding (GMoU) signed with hosts. He lamented that lack of commitment by the multinationals had caused joblessness. According to him, the council would mobilise youths to occupy major oil installations if companies continued to neglect the agreements. He said: “IYC Worldwide is founded to seek equity, equality and justice for our people to improve their standard of living, development and environmental health. “All companies operating within the Ijaw nation in particular and the Niger Delta at large must not violate our sacred values. Although we look forward to having the best of cordial and mutual relationships with them, our friendly disposition should not be taken for granted. “We have, however, discovered insincerity in the operational mechanism of these firms, and this has led to increasing tension in the communities. The council has refused to be passive while the Ijaw are being short-changed. “We have mapped out an action plan to occupy major installations and facilities if these firms continued to treat their social responsibilities lightly. “What we need is peace and security, as such all actions by IOCs that are capable of causing chaos should be avoided.”
