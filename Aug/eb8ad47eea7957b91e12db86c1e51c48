 The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) on Friday in Aba, the commercial nerve of Abia State carried out public destruction of seized drug exhibits by the Abia State Command of the federal government agency. The exercise was carried out by the Governor of Abia State, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu who was assisted by the Chairman/Chief Executive of NDLEA; Col. Muhammad Abdallah (Rtd), heads of various security agencies among other dignitaries at the event. Speaking at the event, Adballah, said  among the illicit drugs destroyed include 6,574.116kg of cannabis, 10.81kg of Heroin, 8.932kg of cocaine and 2,516.394kg of psychotropic substances. According to the NDLEA boss, the Federal Government agency is happy that such an amount of illicit drugs were intercepted by officers of its agency under the Abia Command and as such, preventing the drugs from having their way into the society. He noted  that the havoc it would have wreaked  if it had, had  its way into the state would have been better imagined than experienced. “Drugs, like poison, need not to be in large volumes before doing the incalculable damage. We have to be unrelenting because the criminals illicitly dealing in drugs are unrelenting as they go to all extent in the pursuit of money at the detriment of security, lives and property across the country.” Continuing, Abdallah who added that the agency would do everything within its powers in order to ensure that the entrepreneurial heritage of the people of the state doesn’t come under the threat of drug abuse and illicit trafficking in drugs, noted that nothing diminishes productivity as much as illicit drug trafficking.
