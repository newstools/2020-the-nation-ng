 ASPIRANTS, who contested at the primaries of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), are jostling to be picked as the running mate to Eyitayo Jegede for the October 10 governorship election. Jegede clinched the PDP ticket by polling 888 to defeat his closest rival, Agboola Ajayi, who got 657 votes. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has fixed next Tuesday as the deadline for the substitution of names of governorship candidates and deputies for the poll. Jegede had dropped the name of one of his aides, Olumide Ogunje, as his running mate, but pressure is on him to replace the name with that of one of the aspirants, preferably from Ilaje Local Government. Sources said PDP elders have dropped the names of three aspirants, Godday Erewa, who polled 14 votes; Sola Ebiseni, who got 29 votes; and Banji Okunomo, who scored 90. They all hail from Ilaje Local Government. The PDP governorship candidate had rejected pressure to pick Ajayi, saying he needed somebody he could trust. Other names submitted were John Mafo and Tunde Akindehin.
