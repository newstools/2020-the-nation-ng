 THE All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate in the September 19 governorship election, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, has promised to prioritise recruitment of teachers, if voted as governor. He spoke on Tuesday during his ward-to-ward campaign at Arokho, Otuo and Uahumi communities in Owan East Local Government. Ize-Iyamu said many schools, especially those in rural areas, lacked core subject teachers and basic learning facilities. “We have schools, but no teachers to teach our pupils. Teachers retire on a daily basis, but the current government has refused to employ more teachers. “I promise to prioritise employment of teachers in our schools to ensure our pupils get the right knowledge to become future leaders,” he said. The APC standard-bearer said he would empower vigilance group members and place them on a monthly salary to ensure effective community policing. He said the skill acquisition centre and the hospital built by a former member of the House of Representatives in the area would be made functional. “My SIMPLE agenda is to make life better for Edo people through manpower development, job creation, leadership by example and infrastructural development, among others. “This council is known for farming. I promise to assist farmers with loans and farm inputs if elected governor,” he said. Ize-Iyamu promised to facilitate the installation of telecommunications connectivity equipment at Arokho.
