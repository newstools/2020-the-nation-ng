 A yet- to- be identified woman was confirmed dead in a lone tanker accident at Mile 2 area in Lagos in the early hours of Friday. The Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) disclosed that the driver of the petrol tanker involved in the accident is on the run. Spokesperson of LASEMA, Nosa Okunbor said the tanker with registration number KSF 260 XY which was loaded to capacity with 55,000 litres of PMS (Petrol) ran into a pothole and fell sideways due to reckless driving. According to Okunbor, “the yet-to-be-identified female passenger, who was trapped inside the tanker with her head crashed to the truck dashboard, eventually lost her life in the incident which occurred a little after midnight close to the Nigerian Army Signal Barracks.”  “The incident resulted in a shutdown of major roads that link Mile 2 and its environs despite the swift response of the LASEMA Response.” Okunbor disclosed that the driver of  tanker involved in the accident fled from the scene while the unidentified victim died at the scene of the accident. “Further investigations revealed that the driver and his assistant fled the scene immediately the accident happened. “The lady is still trapped inside the tanker as there is no way of extricating her body because the tanker has pressed her to the dashboard of the tanker head. Okunbor however, assured that the team will use the agency’s heavy-duty equipment (crane) as the only means of recovering the tanker together with its contents. “The team is not sure of trans-loading the contents because nobody has come out to claim ownership of either the tanker or its product,” he added.
