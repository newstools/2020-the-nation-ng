Rivers State governor,  Nyesom Wike, has directed the state leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) led by Amb. Desmond Akawor, not to give the All Progressives Congress (APC) a breathing space in the state. Speaking when Akawor led the state executive committee members to present the party’s action plan to him in his office in the Government House, Port Harcourt, Wike urged the committee to show more love to the party by being loyal and committed. Wike endorsed the action plan of the party and urged them to do their best in consolidating the gains of the party in the state insisting the APC had nothing to offer  Rivers people. He said: “As  officers, you owe the party a lot. You have to consolidate the gains we have already recorded. “No state can say they are better off than Rivers State. We have successfully conducted our congresses without problems. God has given us what it takes.  With all the people working with us and showing commitment, we will move this state to the next level of positive development. “I plead with you all to work cooperatively with the chairman and be united. We are going to  work together to draw up a plan that will make us more effective. “Let nobody deceive you to attend any meeting anybody will call  because he wants to run for governorship. We have not come to that point.  I have just stayed one year in office in my second tenure. We are working for our party to be united to make sure that APC does not have a breathing space in our state. “There is nothing the APC can say to Rivers people today as the reason they should be voted for. Whether it is the federal government, or their political appointees,  they have nothing to tell us. “The money they have approved for us as a refund has not been given to us. But I am not worried.  I will continue to work. We have something we can show to Rivers people.”
