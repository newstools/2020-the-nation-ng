Candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Eyitayo Jegede yesterday began reconciliation move with aggrieved party leaders in Ondo South Senatorial District. Some party members last week resolved to boycott campaign activities of Jegede over choice of his running mate. Party sources said Jegede had pleaded with the senator representing Ondo South, Senator Nicholas Tofowomo, to help him organise PDP leaders in the zone. Jegede has urged Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu not to play God by saying it was not the turn of Ondo Central Senatorial District to produce a governor. He said it was least expected of a governor to say the All Progressives Congress (APC) would rule Ondo State forever. The PDP standard-bearer, who described Akeredoluâ€™s comments as arrogant and oppressive, expressed shock that a governor would talk down on the people. Jegede, speaking through his Head, Media Research Response, Kayode Fasua, said he had been highlighting his programmes of action as campaign issues, but the reverse was the case for Akeredolu.
