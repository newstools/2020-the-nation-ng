  Nigeria recorded less than 2,000 positive cases in July, the Federal Government has disclosed. It further stated the number of testing carried out across the country increased by 40,000 in just one month. A total of 287,532 COVID-19 tests have been carried out so far in Nigeria. The Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, made these known during the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 in Abuja. He also said the Federal Government plans to reduce the deaths from the pandemic to less than one percent. The Federal Government also plans to expand sample collection to rural areas by setting set up at least one COVID-19 sample collection site in every Local Government Area (LGA) with designated holding rooms at General hospitals for patients with significant clinical symptoms. Ehanire said this will ensure patients are not turned back at hospitals. The Minister asked health workers not to fret on Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) ” as we are reasonably well stocked with materials and commodities, which have been supplied to all sections of the country.”
