The Ijaw Leader, Chief Edwin Clark has described as dishonour, the naming of one of the rail stations after former President Goodluck Jonathan and Chief Obafemi Awolowo. Clark said Jonathan as a former president and Chief Awolowo deserved more than that. He said clamping together people who have not made any meaningful marks in the countryâ€™s development alongside great men like Awolowo and Jonathan is not acceptable. He therefore called on President Muhammadu Buhari to withdraw the honour. The Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, had disclosed recently that the president approved the name of the railway station in Agbor, Delta State, be called Goodluck Jonathan Railway Station and Complex President Jonathan accepted the gesture and also thanked Buhari. But Clark however said his people saw the gesture as degrading, especially when it has to be shared with such a caliber of people listed alongside him.
