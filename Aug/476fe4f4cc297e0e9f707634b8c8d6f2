A traditional ruler in Ogun State, Rasheed Sholabi, has been arrested by police for allegedly defiling his 15-year-old daughter. Sholabi, the Baale of Oose Agbedu Ajibawo in Owode-Yewa, was arrested following a complaint by his daughter who reported the alleged assault at Owode Egbado Police Station. Police quoted the teen as alleging that her father had been having sex with her since she was 11 years old. She also reportedly told police that her private part had been damaged as a result of the alleged sexual affair, explaining that she has difficulty controlling her urinary system. The girl was said to have told police that she lost her mother when she was barely two years old and that her father did not allow her access to her maternal relations, leaving her with no option but to live  with him. She said the situation gave her father unhindered opportunity to sexually abuse her routinely until her incontinence condition developed and she had to report him to the police, Abimbola Oyeyemi, police spokesperson, said in a statement yesterday. Abimbola said detectives arrested the traditional ruler at his palace. Initially, the Baale reportedly denied the allegation, but later fainted when confronted by the victim and his ex-wife, who were said to have corroborated the victim’s ordeal. His ex-wife informed the police that she caught him in the act while having sex with his daughter, saying it was why she walked out of the union. The victim has been taken to the Stella Obasanjo Motherless babies Home, Abeokuta, for safety.
