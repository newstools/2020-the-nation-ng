COMMISSIONER for Youth and Social Development in Lagos State Segun Dawodu has called for youth engagement in formal political mechanisms. Dawodu spoke at an event organised by the ministry to mark 2020 International Youth Day. According to him, youths had the potential to contribute to better and more sustainable policies, and restore trust in public institutions. Permanent Secretary of the ministry Mrs. Yewande Falugba stressed that the state decided to focus on issues affecting youths as they were the country’s greatest asset. Falugba extolled the vibrancy, energy, dedication and resourcefulness of the youth, stressing that if these attributes were meaningfully explored, it could translate into a prosperous society. Executive Director of UNFPA Dr. Nathaniel Kanel affirmed that the government had been taken the lead through initiatives and intervention programmes to reach out to out-of-school young people in Nigeria. Kanel, represented by Dr. Esther Shomefu, said one of the initiatives UNPFA was setting up Youth Participatory Platform as a veritable tool for harnessing their potential. Guest Lecturer Dr Olajobi AbdulFatai, who spoke on ‘Youth Engagement for Global Action’, urged participants to imbibe the virtues of volunteerism and patriotism, create time for self development, stay focused and consistent in pursuing dreams.
