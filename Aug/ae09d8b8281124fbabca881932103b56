Let me tell you a bit about a young Ijaw woman named Alaere. She wants a fantastic career and the joy of motherhood. When she is yet to conceive, her mother-in-law blames her and subjects her to snide remarks. Others from her husband’s side join in torturing her emotionally. And when she eventually conceives and suffers a stillbirth, the mother-in-law begins the process of bringing an underaged as second wife for her husband. As she goes through the drama in her home, there is also abundant drama at work: Her Managing Director wants an affair; a female boss also wants her for a romantic relationship; and her driver, Alhaji Wasiu, proves to be annoying. Alhaji Wasiu wants an heir by force and subjects his wife to all manners of rituals, including eating monkey. His five female children mean nothing to him until he drives his wife to her death bed. What men do in search of heirs! Alaere’s travails are laid bare in Dear Alaere, the debut novel of Eriye Onagoruwa. This novel published by Paperworth Books, on the surface, is about Alaere’s tortuous journey to motherhood. But, it is more than that. It is a social commentary on patriarchy and its evils, Lagos and its contradictions and Nigeria, and its failures. It is a very important story rendered in appealing prose! This is one book likely to break your heart in a pleasant dimension and mend it in an exciting manner. Eriye Onagoruwa writes amazing characters, including the annoying Alhaji Wasiu, who I felt like slapping anytime he opened his dirty, stinking mouth. Please buy, read and gift to loved ones.
