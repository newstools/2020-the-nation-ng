 THE Coalition for A Better Nigeria has condemned the financial scandals recently exposed at the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). In a statement titled “State of the Nation”, the group said the revelations suggested that the problems of the Niger Delta region are homegrown, as is the case with the country at large. “The recent startling revelations of misappropriation of funds and extra-budgetary spending of the NDDC calls for concern and has demonstrated that people of the region are their own worst enemies and not the system of government in Nigeria. It also said that the region major problem over the decades was bad leadership. “This explains why the Federal Government of Nigeria is having sleepless nights to sanitise the system. “Kudos to the Federal Government on this noble cause and would like to draw the public’s attention to the fact that the Yoruba nation should be allowed to take a shot at 2023 presidency based on equity, fairness and in recognition of the bloc votes given by the region to President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, during the 2015 and 2019 general elections in the country. “We do appreciate the support of this school of thought from the key individuals in the northern and southern parts of the country.” “We salute former Zamfara State Governor Abdulaziz Yari for standing with the truth that power must shift to the South in 2023 after President Buhari has spent two terms.
