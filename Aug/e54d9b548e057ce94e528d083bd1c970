The All Progressive Congress (APC) in Ogun State, on Friday, denied backing any faction of a group called Inter Party Advisory Council (IPAC) operating in the state. The interim chairman of the party, Yemi Sanusi, made the disclosure in a press statement that he issued in Abeokuta, the state capital. The APC’s stance followed news report that the party had expressed its readiness to support another faction of IPAC at the detriment of the Arabambi faction of the body. “I am totally dismayed that such cocktail of lies could be concocted around my person and our party, APC,” Sanusi said. He added that the APC in Ogun State is not connected to the activities and deliberations of IPAC in the state, stressing, “I hereby disassociate myself and the entire state executive committee of the All Progressive Congress of Ogun State from any publication linking us with IPAC’s activities.”
