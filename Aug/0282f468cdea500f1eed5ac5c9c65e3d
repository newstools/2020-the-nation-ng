TolaniBaj and Prince’s relationship may be heading for the rocks as Tbaj is bitter about discovering things she doesn’t like about him on a daily basis. During a discussion with Neo, the current deputy Head of House, she said she doesn’t like the fact that she keeps correcting Prince every time. She said: “Everyday I discover something I don’t like. If I have to tell someone do this and that every time I feel like I’m changing the person”. She further asked Neo if Prince hasn’t told him anything about their relationship because she asked him not to. “Are you sure he hasn’t spoken about our business with you? I told him not to discuss it with anybody but now I’m doing it.” Neo however promised to talk to Prince. Tolanibaj added if it was outside the House, she won’t bother, stating that Prince is not meeting her expectations.
