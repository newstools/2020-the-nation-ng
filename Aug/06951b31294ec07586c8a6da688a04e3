Operatives of the Ogun State Police Command on Tuesday demobilised a suspected serial killer,  Feyisola Dosunmu, who had terrorised two communities of Iperu and Ogere, killing seven persons in the last three months. Dosunmu, a suspected cultist and drug addict, was declared wanted by police about two weeks ago, even as he remained elusive. Following effective deployment of technology coordinated from Abuja and Lagos, coupled with the cooperation of hunters and vigilante teams in the area, the police tracked him down to his den in forest between Iperu and Ogere in Ikenne Local Government Area of the state where he dug trenches around his lone abode. The Nation learnt that when he sighted the police advancing towards him, he pulled his cutlass and broke a bottle, reminding them that many had met their gruesome deaths at his hands. Police shot him in the knee and thigh and he bled to death while being brought to the city. Dosumu’s victims included  a nursing mother and a security guard attached to a poultry farm at Iperu Remo. Commissioner of Police Edward Ajogun, who paraded Dosunmu’s remains, thanked Governor Dapo Abiodun, the vigilante, hunters and the police for their support that helped bring the serial killer’s reign of terror to an end.
