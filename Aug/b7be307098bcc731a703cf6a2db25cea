 The Peoples Democratic Party’s (PDP’s) standard-bearer in the September 19 poll, Governor Godwin Obaseki, has said he will prioritise the power sector if re-elected. He spoke during his visit to Ewohimi community in Esan South East Local Government, in continuation of his ward to ward campaign. Obaseki said the major challenge observed since the beginning of the tour was shortage of power in the areas he visited.  He said his administration last year built Ossiomo Power Plant because of the electricity challenge faced by the people. The governor said Ossiomo Power Plant was generating 50 megawatts of electricity to the state. The Chairman of the PDP Campaign Council, Chief Dan Orbih, said the election was vital because it would be a test for the sustenance of democracy. He said democracy was about the people, adding that the governor, who was also the party’s candidate, was committed to repositioning the state and moving it forward. The state Chairman of the PDP, Dr. Tony Aziegbemi, said many people from the All Progressives Congress (APC) had defected to the party.
