Nasarawa State Deputy Governor Emmanuel Akabe, who doubles as the state chairman, Task Force on COVID-19, has refused to appear before the House of Assembly Committee on COVID-19 to brief the lawmakers on how the state is taking measures to curtail the pandemic. The Assembly on Wednesday threatened to invoke the relevant sections of the Constitution to compel the committee on COVID-19 to appear before its ad hoc committee. This followed the inability of the state Task Force Committee on COVID-19 members to honour the invitation extended to them by the House Ad hoc Committee on COVID-19. Chairman of the Assembly Committee and member representing Lafia Central, Dahiru Abdullahi Angibi, who stated these while briefing reporters, lamented that the House through its ad-hoc committee invited members of the Task Force Committee, but instead of honouring the invitation, they sent the secretariat officials.
