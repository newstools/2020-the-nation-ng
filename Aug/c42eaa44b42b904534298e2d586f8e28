 D’Banj has picked up a fresh ambassadorial role as the Agro Rangers ambassador with the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps. The singer announced his new role on his official Instagram account a few days after visiting Wells Carlton hotel in Abuja. Speaking on the new role, D’Banj said, “I have dedicated my life and personal effort to putting Nigeria and our collective efforts on the global map, and I find in this initiative undertaken by the Nigerian Civil Defence another wonderful opportunity to do so. Organisations such as the Nigerian Civil Defence that are created to protect Nigerian citizens do need the support of the general public to do so effectively. A joint effort, such as underscored by the Agro-Rangers initiative, is not only a resolution that will tackle head-on the insecurity crisis suffered by our farmers countrywide but will also create jobs and further empower the youths to more actively participate in playing a role in the system. Being myself a farmer of over 15 years, I very well understand the challenges suffered by farmers as incessant and re-occurring attacks stifle production and productivity. This initiative is led by the Nigerian Civil Defence is thus commendable, and one which I wholly identify with.” Meanwhile, D’Banj is expected to enjoy his vacation inside the Abuja based hospitality outfit, Wells Carlton, after a visit in the company of the outfit’s sales Manager, Jerry Opiughie. Opiughie noted that while the hospitality outfit looks forward to hosting D’Banj and other celebrities, new disinfection technologies are some of the changes the management has put in place aside from a special vacation discount for families, couples, and friends.
