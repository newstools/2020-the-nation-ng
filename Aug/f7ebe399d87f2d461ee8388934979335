Former Super Eagles striker Emmanuel and Super Falcons captain Asisat Oshoala are among nine African  stars that featured in the campaigns against domestic violence in Africa. The world soccer ruling body, FIFA has  joined forces with the African Union, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Confederation of African Football (CAF) to jointly address the issue of domestic violence by launching the #SafeHome campaign across the African continent. The #SafeHome campaign launched yesterday across Africa is part of a wider global initiative to raise awareness on this critical issue. The awareness videos had Amuneke, Oshoala, Abel Xavier, Sarah Essam, Khalilou Fadiga, Geremi, Rabah Madjer, Lúcia Moçambique and Clémentine Touré – who convey a series of key messages to the public. The campaign is being published on various FIFA digital channels and African Union and WHO channels. #SafeHome is also being supported by multimedia toolkits for FIFA’s member associations and for media to help facilitate additional localisation and to further amplify the message worldwide. According to CAF, the initiative is designed to support women and children victims of domestic violence, particularly as stay-at-home measures in response to COVID-19 have put them at greater risk. The African Union-FIFA-CAF memorandum of understanding, which was concluded in February 2019, covers joint campaigns on topics of mutual interest and the promotion of gender equality, a key principle. Other areas of collaboration include education through football, sports integrity and safety and security at football matches.
