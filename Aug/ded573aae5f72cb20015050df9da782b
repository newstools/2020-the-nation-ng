 CHIEFTAIN of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and former Minister of Aviation Femi Fani-Kayode has urged the Federal Government to give special allocation to Cross River State to complete Bakassi Deep Seaport and 275km superhighway. Fani-Kayode spoke after a tour of the projects. He described the superhighway as essential and very progressive. According to him, the project ‘will enhance Nigeria’s unity and promote integration of northern/southern national infrastructure’. He said: “The superhighway is an evacuation corridor from Bakassi Deep Seaport, which will open up the Atlantic Ocean to the North. This will open up trade and enhance national cohesion and integration. “President Muhammadu Buhari may have seen what other people may not see in Governor Ben Ayade, which has made him visit Cross River many times. ‘’He is always talking of Cross River being the good example of what other states should be doing and I share his view. “There should be special consideration to support the 275km superhighway and Bakassi Deep Seaport because they are not for Cross River’s benefit alone; these are massive projects that northern Nigeria will benefit from. “No other state has envisioned such projects, and there are very few states that are in a position to do such. The deep seaport is a brilliant idea, which is capital intensive. I call on the Federal Government to invest in these projects and support them in the name of national unity, security and cohesion so other states can do similar things that will benefit the country.”
