Nigeria international, Victor Osimhen believes he made the right choice signing for Serie A side, Napoli after initially expressing his doubts. The 21-year-old told a press conference at the Azzurri’s Castel di Sangro training camp on Wednesday that he was initially worried because of racism which had always targeted black players. “I’ve been made to feel very welcome – there are some great lads here. It’s a dream come true for me to be here and I’m delighted to be at such a great club with such a passionate fanbase. “From a technical perspective, I’ve seen that you train hard under Gattuso and I like that way of working because it’s the right way to improve.” The player who became the club’s most expensive players after completing a five-year deal worth €50m plus €10m in bonuses from Ligue 1 side, Lille last month also talked about the kind of striker that he is. “I like to get involved with the play. My team-mates are vital to me. My motto is never say never. Everything is possible in football. “This is a squad of great players and it’s a big step up for me to be here. I’m focusing on doing everything I can for the team and helping my team-mates.” Osimhen is expected to make his non-competitive debut for his new club in a three-team friendly tournament featuring Aquila and Castel di Sangro from this Friday.
