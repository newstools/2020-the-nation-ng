A suspect, Ifeanyi Odo, 42, has told police in Lagos that he took to  burglary to survive after the Federal Government closed land borders last year. “Before then, I used to import Ghana black soap and cream which I sold in Lagos but with the border closed, I could not feed and took to breaking into shops for survival,” he said. Odo was arrested with one Onyebuchi Chidozie, 39, on August 4, after detectives found 43 sets of 32-inch LG plasma TV at their hideout. It was alleged that they have stolen phone accessories and jewelery worth millions of naira.
