The minister of Youth and Sports Development Sunday Dare has been lauded for the move to resuscitate long distance running in Nigeria after years of neglect. Former national steeplechase record holder, Professor Ezra Gunnen, said the minister’s efforts to see that long distance runners in Nigeria get the required training, exposure and opportunity to compete locally and internationally are steps in right direction. Gunnen  who heads the technical committee for the project at resuscitating long distance races, has identified two training areas in Jos, Plateau state and Mambila in Taraba state to develop facilities for altitude training.  He said: “Before now, middle and long distance development has never been a focus of any administration since the time of (Group  Capt. Anthony) Ikhazobor. “Failure to develop the potentials in youths is causing them to depend on government for everything and when it’s not forthcoming, they join all sorts of groups. Prosecuting the project requires the will power of the Sports Ministry to channel resources in the right direction once and for all.  “ Once developed, sponsors and organizations interested in specific athletes will take over.” He said  the project  committee which  inaugurated  in June will commence almost immediately now with the relaxation of Covid-19 rules for non-contact sports in Nigeria of which track and field is one.
