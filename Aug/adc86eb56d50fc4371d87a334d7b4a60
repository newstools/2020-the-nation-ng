Osun State Governor Adegboyega Oyetola on Thursday decried the allotment of slots belonging to the state to non-indigenes. He urged the Federal Character Commission (FCC) to ensure equity and fairness in distribution of position. The governor stressed that it is unfair and criminal for non-indigenes to take the slots belonging to the state in the distribution of important positions. A statement by the governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Mr, Ismail Omipidan, said Oyetola spoke in Osogbo, the state capital, while hosting a delegation of the FCC, led by its Commissioner from Osun State, Mr. Adeoye Rasak. “We have heard instances of non-indigenes taking the slots of Osun State when it comes to positions distribution. That is not fair, that is criminal. So, you need to seriously look into that, moving forward. “Please, try to do an analysis of all positions and assess how far we have been able to occupy the positions. If we have any interloper, let us know so that such would be prosecuted for fraud,” Oyetola said. The governor urged the leadership of the commission to always ensure equity, fairness and evenness among governments’ agencies and reflect same in its dispositions.
