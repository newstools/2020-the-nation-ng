 LIVERPOOL are set to bank £3.5m from the sale of Ovie Ejaria to Reading. The 22-year-old is closing in on a permanent move to Berkshire that was originally agreed as part of a loan deal for the 2019-20 season. The Royals’ ability to complete the transfer had been thrown into doubt by suggestions that they were facing a transfer embargo from the EFL. However, they were recently been given the green light to sign players, starting with Ejaria. The London-born midfielder has played 55 games for Reading over the course of two loan stints, the first of which began in January 2019. Ejaria made a total of eight first-team appearances for Liverpool after joining the club’s academy from Arsenal in 2014.
