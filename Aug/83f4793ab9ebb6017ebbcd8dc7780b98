The current Deputy Head of House Kiddwaya believes sexual relations should be kept private. He argued men shouldn’t open up on their sexual relations with anyone as it should remain a secret between both parties. Kidd noted that real men will never kiss and tell. Nengi had asked Kidd who is the best (girl) he had had. He replied saying “gentle men don’t kiss and tell”.
