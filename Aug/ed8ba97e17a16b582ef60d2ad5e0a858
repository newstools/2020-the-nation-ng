With the establishment of a National Commission for Refugees, Migrants and Internally Displaced Persons (NCFRMI) and a federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, the federal government can be said to be interested in the plight of displaced persons in the country. Over the years, many persons, especially in the northern region of the country, have been displaced from their natural habitats largely due to attacks by insurgents who have overran many communities. Despite the efforts of the security agencies, Internal Displaced Persons (IDPs) camps that are supposed to be temporary abodes have become permanent as there is no guarantee of the safety for displaced persons if they return home. Notwithstanding claims by governments at all levels of catering for IDPs with various financial allocations and material support, displaced persons in camps are going through various hardships. Even with the support of international organisations, corporate organisations and individuals, there is still a lot that needs to be done to properly manage internal displacement in the country. To address this issue, Journalists for Christ International Outreach, a faith-based media organisation which I lead as President on Friday launched a report aimed at ensuring global best practices in guaranteeing the rights of IDPs in the country. The research report which was conducted with the support of the World Association for Christian Communication (WACC) and Waldensian Church’s Otto Per Mille (OPM), Italy is a follow-up of an earlier project titled Monitoring Media Reportage and Portrayal of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs); Case studies of Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo and Kenya implemented in 2018/2019. The observations, conclusions and recommendations of the report provide indications on how to address the gaps and ensure improvements in the management of IDPs’ situation in Nigeria. Below are some of the key points that should be of interest to all those concerned with managing internal displacement in the country.
