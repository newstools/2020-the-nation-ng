The governorship candidate of the Action Democratic Party (ADP), Martin Olateru-Olagbegi, has described the reduction of tuition fees by Governor Rotimi Akeredolu as a political gimmick. He said the action was meant to fool people to get their votes. In a statement in Akure, Olateru-Olagbegi alleged that the All Progressives Congress (APC) has ruined the fortunes of the state despite the enormous natural resources. He hoped that the people would not be fooled by what he termed ‘the governor’s latest antic’ Olateru-Olagbegi promised to turn things around if elected as governor in the areas of agriculture, health and security, with support from his friends scattered across the world.
