 DOCTORS in the Philippines are calling for a strict lockdown in the capital Manila or risk losing the battle to check the spread of coronavirus. The country’s fragile health system, according to the medics, requires a time out to avert collapse, even as the World Health Organisation (WHO) recorded the highest daily number of new cases so far during the pandemic. “Our health workers are suffering burnout with a seemingly endless number of patients trooping to our hospitals for emergency care and admission,” said Jose Santiago, president of the leading doctors’ group, Philippine Medical Association, on the heel of the temporary closure of Manila’s largest government hospitals as infections hit medical workers. He said doctors were “waging a losing battle against Covid-19 and we need to draw up a consolidated and definitive plan of action.” The country posted a record of about 4,000 cases each day in the past 48 hours. Total infections as at Friday were 93,354, the second highest number of cases in south-east Asia. The doctors advised President Rodrigo Duterte to re-impose strict lockdown in Manila and nearby provinces from 1 to 15 August to give health workers a “time out”. They said the government should also use the time to “recalibrate strategies against Covid-19”. The Philippines imposed one of the longest and strictest lockdowns in the region not seen in other countries, but the doctors said poor detection, isolation and contact tracing have failed to contain the disease. Since lockdowns were eased, outbreaks in construction sites and industrial plants have been reported.
