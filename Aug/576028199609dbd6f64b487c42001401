 What is a great accessory that won’t put you in the shade. Whatever your mood, be it romantic, sensual, western, street punk or pop, there is a hat look to fit it. Hats in general have left the church scene to take a place on the fashion stage. This should not be surprising. Fashion is never static; it is always evolving. Some come with or without a brim or festooned with flowers. All over the world, most popular hats are fashioned after traditional French and English styles, featuring sinamay, straw, raffia, soft, cozy and flexible wool which allow a snug fit for any shape of head. Hats  are very versatile, lightweight and easy to slide on. Their colours and designs vary and are too cute to be ignored. So, go funky with one.
