The Inspector-General of Police, IGP Mohammed Adamu, has assured that his men would remain neutral and professional as they ensure the maintenance of law and order in the forthcoming Edo and Ondo States governorship elections. Adamu, who spoke when he received Civil Society Organizations to brainstorm on measures to ensure hitch-free elections, promised the police would deploy all resources to ensure a level playing field for all parties involved in the elections. The IGP, who pointed out the likelihood of violence in the elections, said the police had already deployed intelligence to generate threat analysis which would be used to sustain their processes in elections in both states, to prevent any breakdown of law and order. Adamu said the police acknowledged the contributions of CSOs as key actors in the electioneering process in the country, hence the need for the interactive sessions in view of the upcoming elections. “The objective is to share knowledge and compare knowledge especially in regards to experiences with election security in Nigeria. “We shall have discussions on key indicators of key election security threats especially arming and movements of political thugs, use of inciting statements during political campaigns, the high likelihood of violence, the issue of misinformation and disinformation aimed at heating up the polity,” he said.
