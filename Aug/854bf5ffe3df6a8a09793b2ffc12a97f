First Head of House Nengi has told Kiddwaya she feels he is avoiding her. Nengi told Kidd during a short chat in the kitchen after the Saturday night party. She said she feels Kidd has been avoiding her lately even when he talks to other Housemates. Nengi noted that it all started after she used his perfume days back. “I feel a certain way about you but right now, you are distancing yourself from me. “Why are you distancing yourself from me? Why were you bored with me? I want to know why. I don’t get bored with friends. “How do you get bored with someone you call your friend? In this house, if you are a friend to somebody, you need that person every single time…like you were naturally avoiding me,” she said.
