 BANNED commercial motorcycles popularly known as okada are back on Lagos high roads and bridges. Okada riders have taken over major highways and especially the Oshodi-Abule-Egba BRT corridor, commissioned by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu earlier this month. Though the operators initially avoided the highways in deference to the law and the clampdown by the government, they are now back with daring courage, operating in daytime, to beat traffic buildup on the other lanes. Efforts to get the governmentâ€™s position on the development proved abortive at press time as the Commissioner for Transportation Dr Frederic Oladeinde neither answered phone calls nor responded to an SMS sent to him by our correspondent. The state government had in February this year clamped down on okada operation in the state.
