 MOBILE courts sitting in different parts of Abia State have convicted 20 persons arrested by the State’s Police Command for not wearing face masks. The Nation had reported that the state government had warned residents and visitors against breaching COVID-19 protocols including mandatory wearing of face masks which it said could warrant a series of punishments including arraignment before any Mobile Court sitting in the state. This was disclosed by the Commissioner of Police in the state, CP Janet Agbede who was represented by the Deputy Commissioner of Police in-charge of Operations, DCP Sani. Sani who was speaking at the flag-off of COVID-19 Community Testing Sensitisation ceremony in Aba South Local Government Area of the state said that those that were convicted were meant to pay fines and also engage in various community services, if they don’t have the money to pay for their fines. The DCP Operations said that the arrest and arraignment of the offenders before the mobile court was in compliance with the directives of the Abia State Governor, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu to the security agencies in the state to go after defaulters of the COVID-19 protocols in the state. Speaking at the event, the representative of the governor of the state and chairman Abia State COVID-19 Task Force Barr. Chris Ezem said the choice for Aba for the flag off of the exercise which is going on simultaneously across the 17 local governments in the state is because of the strategic nature of the commercial city.
