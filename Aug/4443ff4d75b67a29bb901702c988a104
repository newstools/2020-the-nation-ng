The Onogie of Ewohimi in Esan South East Local Government, Peter Ojiefo, has sought peaceful campaigns. He spoke on Tuesday in his palace at Ewohimi when the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) campaigned at the community. Addressing the campaign team led by the governorship candidate, Governor Godwin Obaseki, the monarch said it was imperative that the election be devoid of violence, as the state was known for peace. “I also know that you are a hardworking and very peaceful person. “So please continue to ensure that peace continues to prevail in the state throughout the electioneering as well as during the elections,” the monarch said. Obaseki, who is seeking re-election, assured the monarch that he would use apparatus within his disposal to ensure a peaceful governorship election. He noted that development could only thrive in a peaceful environment. “That is why I decided to go to the people to sell our programmes and that is why we are here. “I believe the election will be based on our ability to convince the populace of what we have done and what we can do,” he said. Obaseki hailed the monarch and the traditional council for their support and prayers for his administration over the years.
