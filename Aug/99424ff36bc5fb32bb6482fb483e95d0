The Coca-Cola Foundation (TCCF) has announced the funding of a recycling initiative aimed at solving the long-standing problem of plastic waste defacing the Abuja and Lagos cities’ landscape and littering the drainage systems. TCCF provided a grant to the “Initiative for the Advancement of Waste Management in Africa (W.A.S.T.E AFRICA), a non-governmental organisation, to promote waste as a valuable currency for social good and economic inclusion in Abuja and Lagos. The grant will impact both cities through the creation of eight solar-powered recycling hubs. Through the Cash 4 Trash initiative, the funding received will be used to build eight solar-powered recycling hubs in communities such as Nyanya, Zuba, Bwari, Kuje, Gwagwalada, Jikwoyi, Galadimawa and Makoko. Also, through the Foundation’s conversion of waste to cash, residents can now turn their waste into wealth while adopting the habit of recycling.
