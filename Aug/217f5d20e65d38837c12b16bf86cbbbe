 INDIGENES of Garki, Apo Akpajenya and Dagbalo communities have criticised the claims by the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA), that they have been resettled and compensated before 223 houses in the community were demolished. A community leader Rev. Tanko Danjuma, who faulted the claims by the FCT authority that in a statement, described it as false, adding that the resettlement process has remained inconclusive. “Despite several attempts and cooperation by the people of Akpanjenya to ensure practical application of master plan in the FCC, the officials of FCDA on many occasions had defaulted on all fronts, frustrating and using the changes in the name of resettlement to their own advantage.” “We are destroying our society by enlarging unwarranted actions in our land. “Garki village was integrated in 1990. In 2005, names of household in Garki village, APO and Akpajenya community were collected for expansion and that of other Nigerians. In 1990 it was agreed that except for overriding purposes, no community or individual compound wall should be moved or shifted.
