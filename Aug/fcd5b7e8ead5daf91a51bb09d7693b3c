Some students who tested positive for COVID -19 while sitting for the ongoing 2020 West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) have been discharged, the Federal Government said on Monday. Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba, disclosed this during a briefing by the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, in Abuja. He said all the students, who have tested negative, are back in class. About four students writing the WASSCE in Gombe tested positive while one case was reported in Kwara state. The Minister said: “We have confirmed that all of them are back in class. They have now been tested, they have all been discharged. We do not have any further cases. “There were four in Gombe, there was one in Kwara and there were few in Bayelsa but this morning on my way inspecting schools that are in exam classes, those of them have been discharged as they all tested negative. “We are still getting feedback from the field in case there are any new places where this may crop up.” Speaking on plans to reopen tertiary institutions, the Minister said the preparedness of tertiary institutions has been tabled before the task force. He said the Task Force will put together all the preparations and use it to issue national guidance that tertiary institutions will use as a guide to reopen schools.
