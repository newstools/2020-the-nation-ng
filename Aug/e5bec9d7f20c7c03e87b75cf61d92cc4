The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has described  the death of elder statesman and leader of Afenifere, Pa Ayo Fasanmi as a huge loss to the nation. In a statement on Friday by the spokesman for the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, the party lamented the passage, saying his death was also a loss to humanity at large. The party said Pa Fasanmi was an outstanding democrat who dedicated his life towards the stability and development of the nation. The PDP acknowledged his leading roles in the entrenchment of democratic practice, equity, justice and national cohesion, especially as a member of the House of Representatives in the First Republic and a Senator in the Second Republic. The party recalled the patriotic roles played by Pa Fasanmi as a member of the National Constitutional Conference of 1994, which further laid the foundation for the birthing of the present democratic order, in addition to his continued leadership counsel towards the stability of the nation, which he did to the very end. “Our party is deeply pained that Pa Fasanmi left the stage at the time our nation needed his wealth of experience, wise counsel, prayers and leadership direction the most”. The party however said it found solace in the fact that Pa Fasanmi triumphed in life and left very strong legacies and leadership footprints for the younger generation of leaders to follow in the task of nation building. The PDP condoled with the Fasanmi family, the Afenifere group, the government and people of Ekiti and Osun states respectively and prayed God to grant the nation the fortitude to bear the irreplaceable loss.
