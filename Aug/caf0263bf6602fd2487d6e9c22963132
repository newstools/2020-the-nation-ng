Acting Vice-Chancellor, University of Port Harcourt, (UNIPORT) Prof. Stephen Okodudu, has inaugurated two committees to resolve grievances among stakeholders of the university community. A statement signed by the Public Relations Officer of the university, Mr. Sam Kpenu, said Okodudu appointed Prof. Anele Ihekwaba to head the Committee on Resolution of Subsisting Legal Issues between the University and Other Parties and Prof. Kanu Nkangineme to chair the Committee on Staff and Students’ Grievances. Speaking at the Governing Council Chamber, University Park during the inauguration on Thursday, the acting VC told them to submit their reports within a month. He said the numerous court cases and disaffection among staff and students must be resolved immediately to stop the widening gap of communality in the academic environment. He said: “I enjoin the respective Committees not to use this opportunity for dialogue that this exercise presents, to open new contentious issues or engage in blame game. We have done enough of that already to no fruitful end. To everything there is a time and season. “For me, who is right or wrong is immaterial at this stage. What is right is what matters now. Just do justice to all by addressing the issues and resolve them on the basis of the fine principles that are encapsulated in the Statute and other regulations governing such issues in the university and by convention established by the founding fathers of this University.” Okodudu enjoined all stakeholders to eschew divisive tendencies and return the university to the path of inclusiveness. The chairman of the committees in their different remarks promised to execute the task to the best of their ability.
