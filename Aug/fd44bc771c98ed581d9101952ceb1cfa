 EIGHT pupils are writing the West African Senior School Certificate Examinations (WASSCE) in isolation centres in Gombe and Kwara States. Seven of them from Government Girlsâ€™ College, Doma, Gombe State, have tested positive for the Coronavirus (COVID-19), while one female student is from Kwara. The Federal Government had permitted schools to reopen partially on August 4 for graduating classes to write their examinations. Speaking on Wednesday, Habu Dahiru, commissioner for education, said the government had conducted 1,100 tests on the final-year students following their resumption. On Monday, an unnamed student of Government Science Secondary School (GSSS) in the state wrote his first paper for the West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) from the isolation centre. The commissioner said the seven new patients are also candidates writing the WASSCE. In Kwara State a female 16-year-old COVID-19 patient is sitting for her senior secondary school certificate examination at the Kwara State COVID-19 Infectious Disease Centre in Ilorin, the state capital, an official said on Wednesday. The patient(whose name and school were withheld to avoid stigma)wrote her Agricultural Science paper yesterday, under close supervision by an official of the West African Examination Council (WAEC). Team Lead/Manager Case Management Team, Kwara COVID-19/Infectious Diseases Centre, Dr Kudirat Oladeji-Lambe, told reporters that the candidate is asymptomatic, stable, and fit to write the exams.
