Two orphanages and no fewer than 50 indigent households in Niger State have received foodstuff, clothing and shoes, among other things, from a non-government organisation, the Good Samaritan. The beneficiaries were drawn from conflict-affected communities and rural communities across Bosso, Chachanga and Shiroro local government areas of the state. Coordinator of the NGO, Cesnabmililo Dorothy Nuhu-Aken’Ova explained what informed the gesture, saying: “There has been lock-down and restriction of movement, while families have had their farms raided by thieves, leaving them with no foodstuff to sell. It has been challenging to make ends meet. “We decided to add clothes because just giving food is not enough, some people need clothes to cover their body and we decided to meet these needs of them indiscriminately. “The people we have reached out to include those with low income, people with disabilities, farmers whose farms are affected by banditry and insurgency, and orphanages.”
