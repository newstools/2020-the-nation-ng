An indigenous oil and gas firm, Neconde Energy Limited, has said the passage of the much-awaited Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) into law will cause a paradigm shift that will lead to the development of the energy sector and the economy. Head of Gas Ventures at Neconde, Chichi Emenike, who stated this also noted that the declaration of 2020 as a year of gas by the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, would spur attention to gas prospects, which could be used to cause economic recovery post-COVID-19 pandemic. According to her, quick economic recovery post-COVID-19 pandemic could be realised if there are enforceable laws to regulate the way of doing things in the sector. Speaking at a webinar on “Gas as a new frontier for economic growth,” Emenike said the speedy passage of the PIB will encourage more investors in the oil and gas space to see Nigeria as a choice investment destination where their stakes will be protected. She said that Nigeria cannot afford to continue to be seen as a place with flip-flop legislations in its oil and gas sector when smaller countries have since emplaced valuable statutes that have strengthened their oil and gas industry. She said aside from the willing buyer-willing seller approach that will drive the sector with appropriate gas pricing, the full liberalisation of the sector should be considered by the government in order to attract the much-needed investments on key gas infrastructures across the country. She commended the Federal Government for inaugurating the Nigerian Gas Transportation Network Code (NGTNC), saying the initiative will liberalise the gas market and address infrastructure constraints in the sector.
