The Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) has demanded reversal of the suspension slammed on its only lawmaker in the House of Assembly, Mr. Tomide Akinribido. He was suspended on Monday for gross misconduct and alleged use of abusive language on the Speaker, Bamidele Oleyelogun. Akinribido, however, described his suspension as politically-motivated. ZLP spokesman Felix Olatunde said in a statement that the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration was taking governance to a reckless level. He said the suspension of the only ZLP lawmaker was the height of high handedness at play. Olatunde said it was deplorable for Speaker Oleyelogun to be acting the script of the APC-led executive. The statement said: “ZLP sees this act as capable of reducing the legislative authority and parliamentary immunity of the state to a puppet status. “Therefore, we demand the reversal of the repressive act by the Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu administration and its prompt apology to the law-abiding people of Ondo State in general and the good people of Ondo West Constituency 1 in particular for riding roughshod on the electorate this much. “The good people of Ondo West Constituency 1 should remain calm as we pursue the redress of this injustice with legitimate approaches at our disposal.”
