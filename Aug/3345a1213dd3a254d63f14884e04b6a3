 The Federal Government at the weekend distributed selection forms to beneficiaries of its public works programme in Kwara State. About 16,000 will benefit from the programme. Chairman of the state Selection Committee Oluwasegun Oyewo said the programme had been designed to be transparent, apolitical and devoid of party affiliation. Places visited for the distribution of forms in Kwara Central are Ogidi, Balogun Fulani and Ipata market wards. The committee was also in Ogele, Asa Local Government.  Oyewo said: “Selection of beneficiaries for the Federal Government Public Work programme is non-partisan and apolitical. ‘’We have coordinators in every local government area who will visit each ward in the council to share the form to potential beneficiaries. As long as the metrics – between 18 and 50 years and resident in Kwara State – are met, the programme will be transparent…”
