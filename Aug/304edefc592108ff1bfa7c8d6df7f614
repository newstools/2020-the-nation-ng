 MARKETS in Rivers State will reopen from 7am to 6pm daily, beginning from Tuesday. Governor Nyesom Wike, who gave the directive in a broadcast, however said Rumukwurushe (Oil Mill) and Oginiba Slaughter Markets remain shut. The governor, in a statement by the Commissioner for Information and Communications, Paulinus Nsirim, said the markets must operate in strict compliance with the established protocols on wearing of face masks, washing of hands and maintaining social distancing. He said the ban was lifted to increase the tempo of economic activities. He said: “Market managers must provide for hand washing and use of sanitisers for everyone at the entrance, ensure wearing of face masks and maintaining social distancing. “Any market that opens to the public and fails to comply with these protocols shall be shut again. The managers shall be prosecuted while the contravening shops shall be forfeited to the state without notice. “Churches can now hold services with 50 per cent of their hall capacity provided the leadership can enforce wearing of face masks and washing of hands…”
