 AS the country continues its fight against the spread of Covid-19, the federal government has announced an extension of a nationwide lockdown by four weeks, making it the third extension for the second phase of an eased lockdown put in place to contain the rampaging virus. This was disclosed last week by Boss Mustapha, Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) ad chairman of the Presidential Task Force on Covid-19, at one of the briefings in Abuja. Last week, Nigeria recorded a total of 2,603 new cases and 59 deaths, unlike in the previous week (that is from Sunday July 26 to Saturday August 1), when there were 3,560 new infections and 27 deaths; or from July 19 to 25, when Nigeria recorded a total of 3,870 new coronavirus infections and 78 deaths in one week. With 46,140 confirmed cases and 942 deaths so far (as at August 8), Nigeria has the third highest number of coronavirus cases in Africa. The number of discharged cases so far in Nigeria stood at 33,044 – more than half of confirmed cases since the country recorded its index case on February 27, when an Italian businessman tested positive to the novel virus. So far, a total of 314,632 tests have been carried out in Nigeria as of August 8. In Africa, in terms of magnitude of coronavirus infections and death tolls, South Africa (having recorded 553,188 cases and more than 10,000 deaths) and Egypt (with 95,314 cases and 4,992 deaths) lead the continental chart, coming first and second, respectively. But if fatalities in South Africa and Egypt seemed high, figures about recoveries have been impressive, with 404,568 out of 553,188 confirmed cases fully recovered from their infections, as South Africa currently has 414,778 closed cases. In Egypt, which last week recorded seventh consecutive day of coronavirus infections less than 200 cases, over 51,000 people out of total 95,314 confirmed to have tested positive have recovered from the disease. In Nigeria, on Saturday August 8th, 453 new confirmed cases and 6 deaths were recorded, according to data from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).  That was the second highest infection figure recorded throughout last week. The 453 new cases were reported in 20 states: FCT (75), Lagos (71), Benue (53), Delta (39), Borno (30), Enugu (25), Plateau (24), Osun (20), Abia (19), Oyo (17), Kaduna (16), Kano (13), Ebonyi (13), Ogun (9), Kwara (7), Ondo (6), Gombe (3), Ekiti (2), Akwa Ibom (1) and Rivers (1). The infection data posted on Friday August 7 was less than figures recorded on August 8. On August 7, four hundred and forty-three (443) confirmed cases were reported in 19 states. There states are: Plateau (103), Lagos (70), FCT (60), Ondo (35), Edo (27), Rivers (27), Kaduna (20), Osun (19), Borno (18), Oyo (18), Kwara (11), Adamawa (9), Nasarawa (7), Gombe (6), Bayelsa (4), Imo (4), Bauchi (2), Ogun (2) and Kano (1).  On August 7, Nigeria lost 6 souls to Covid-19 illness – same number that dies on August 8.

Sadly, 5 deaths were recorded in five states: Adamawa (1), Benue (1), Cross River (1), Ebonyi (1) and Edo (1).  Against all expectations that Nigeria has started flattening the curve in its coronavirus response, experts have called for caution, saying the declining infection rates are not a yardstick to assume that the country is nearing that milestone. Last week, the NCDC Director-General, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, said the reduction in new infections being witnessed currently was a product of sudden decline in the number of samples collected across the 36 states, including the Federal Capital Territory, FCT. As far as he is concerned, it was too early for Nigerians to see the drop in cases as flattening the curve, stressing that a decline in new cases does not translate to being at the end of the pandemic. “We had a decline in the number of samples collected across states between the 31st of July and 2nd of August. This may be associated with the public holiday which led to a reduction in activities across the country. It is still too early to interpret a decline in new cases as flattening the curve. We are learning from countries in Europe and other parts of the world that a decline in new cases does not translate to being at the end of the pandemic. “In most of these countries, they are experiencing an increase in cases again. We are proud of the leadership of the Lagos State Government in responding to this outbreak, but will not relent in our response activities. Although Lagos State is the epicenter of the outbreak in Nigeria, various states are at different phases of the outbreak. In some states, we are recording an increase in cases. We are only as strong as our weakest link and will continue to maintain momentum in the response, despite the decline in the number of new cases in Lagos. “This does not mean the pandemic has ended or that the virus is no longer with us. It means we all have to take responsibility by adhering to public health and safety measures, as we resume business, school, religious activities, etc. Importantly, people who are at high risk must know that they have to take extra precautions,” he said. Those above 60 years or with underlying illness should be completely discouraged from travelling or attending gatherings.  In the absence of a vaccine, the only way we can limit our risk is by taking precautions- wear a mask when in public, wash your hands frequently with soap and running water, and maintain 2 metres from the next person,” he said.
