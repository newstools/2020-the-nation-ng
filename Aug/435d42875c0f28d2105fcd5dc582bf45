The Social Democratic Party (SDP) in Ondo State has said alleged comments of violence credited to a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Hon Isaacs Kekemeke, would not scare it out of the October 10 governorship race. It said it was capable of matching up with Kekemeke. The party said it has members of Kekemeke make and size. Governorship candidate of the party, Mr. Tope Fasua, who spoke in Akure, said Kekemeke should not have descended low to make such threatening comments owing to the various political office he (Kekemeke) held in the state. Fasua noted the lessons were for politicians to always watch what they say in public or political gathering. He urged Kekemeke to apologise to people of the state. On the preparation by the electoral body, Fasua said INEC has no reasons to fail Ondo people because it is one state election.
