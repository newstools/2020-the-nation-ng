26-year-old Neo has sacrificed all his BBNaira to get fresh flowers for Vee’s birthday. As Vee turns 24 on Wednesday, August 24 Neo made the biggest sacrifice to see her smile. Neo had reminded Biggie about his intention to surprise and celebrate Vee’s birthday with a bouquet during his Diary session.to which Biggie promised to look into. On Day 30, Biggie instructed Kiddwaya to pass a message across to Neo on his request. Biggie told Kiddwaya to ask Neo if he still wanted flowers for Vee. If his answer was yes, then he must agree to trade two items for the flowers. Since he was instructed to keep it a secret between himself and Neo, Kiddwaya called Neo aside to pass across the message. He was to sacrifice all his BB Naira for the week and any of his personal belongings. Upon hearing this, Neo was told what to do to get his request for bae granted. He didn’t waste a second as he went through his drawers and scouted for a shirt to sacrifice. Kiddwaya went to deliver the first sacrifice to Biggie and then came back to tell Neo his second item to forgo – all his BB Naira for the week. Neo didn’t hesitate to agree to Biggie’s terms and conditions. Neo’s decision to sacrifice his entire BBNaira for the week to get flowers for Vee is not unconnected with Vee’s dream of having a special and memorable 24th birthday. Neo had also noted that Vee had always told him how much she loves flowers.
