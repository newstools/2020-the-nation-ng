Spanish giants FC Barcelona have foreclosed the possibility of selling star player Lionel Messi. Messi turned in a transfer request to the club on Tuesday following dissatisfaction with the board’s sporting project. But Barcelona Technical Secretary Ramon Planes made it clear the club isn’t considering that option at all and will be making every effort to convince Messi to stay. “We want to build another winning cycle alongside the best player in the world. We all continue to count on Messi. “We are not contemplating a departure of Messi. We want Messi to stay. “We are working internally to convince Messi to stay. Messi has not told us that he’s not going to show up for training,” he said.
