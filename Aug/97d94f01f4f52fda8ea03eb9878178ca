 RIVERS State High Court will hear a suit by former Managing Director of Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) Joy Nunieh against Minister of Niger Delta Affairs Godswill Akpabio on August 13. Nunieh sued Akpabio and four others for the invasion of her home by policemen last month. Nunieh alleged that she was being trailed because of her summons by the House of Representatives committee on NDDC following a probe of the commission’s accounts. She went to the court with an exparte application seeking protection from alleged arrest. Nunieh urged the court to restrain the respondents or/and their agents from inviting or arresting her pending determination of the case. At yesterday’s sitting, the police and DSS were in court but Akpabio was absent. Efforts by Nunieh’s lawyer to amend a section of the suit were frustrated by the police, who said they were yet to be served the process. Lawyer to the police Gladys Inegu denied having been served, but Justice Elsie Thompson confirmed that an endorsed copy of proof of substituted service was already before her and that all parties have been served through substituted means. Inegu however insisted on not allowing the amendment until she had studied the document, and so urged the court to grant a short adjournment. Justice Thompson granted the request and adjourned the case till August 13.
