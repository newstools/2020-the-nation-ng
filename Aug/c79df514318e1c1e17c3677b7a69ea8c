 As controversy continues  to trail the signing into law of the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA), the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) South-South, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to revoke the contentious  section for peace to reign in the nation. The  vice president, Bishop Simeon Okah, made the call during a briefing with newsmen in Warri, where he posited that the rancour that greeted the signing of the law should cause a “rethink” on the part of the Federal Government. Dr. Okah, who is the founder of Flock of Christ Mission, stated that those who “smuggled” in the controversial section 839 (1) & (2) are enemies of Nigeria, adding that the church will not sit back and watch anyone violate its rights. He also explained that as a travelled preacher, the regulations in place in Western nations like the United States of America (USA) and Britain are basically to protect government’s investment in the churches, since as non-governmental organisations, they receive grants from the government, hence pastors have to account for the funds. “But in Nigeria, government has no investment whatsoever in churches and so has no moral right to regulate what it has no inputs in,” the Bishop stated. He noted that the church has kept the law by paying taxes and subjecting to all regulations, its businesses such as schools and hospitals which are profit oriented. Bishop Okah further emphasized that it is not in the place of government to attempt to remove trustees and foist leadership on a religious organisation, as that would amount to denial of religious freedom which is against the spirit of the Nigerian constitution.
