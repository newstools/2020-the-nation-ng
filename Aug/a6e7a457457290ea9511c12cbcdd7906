 LEADERS of Arogbo Ijaw in Ese-Odo Local Government have expressed satisfaction about the performances of Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu. They said the governor had developed the state in the last three and a half years. The Chairman of Arogbo-Ijaw Community Organisation (AICO), Deacon James Ashidi, who spoke when he led other Ijaw leaders to visit Akeredolu, said there had been commitments to the service of the people. He praised the governor for building the first flyover in the state, the Ore interchange otherwise called the Redemption Bridge, among other infrastructural projects in the Southern Senatorial District. Ashidi thanked the governor for counting Ese-Odo Local Government worthy to be listed as part of oil producing areas. He thanked Akeredolu for appointing Arogbo Ijaw indigenes into his executive council (exco), especially Information and Orientation Commissioner Donald Ojogo. Akeredolu described Ojogo as a man of honour and integrity, who could be trusted and relied upon. “Ojogo is a loyal man and not a pretender. He stood his ground on a number of things. I’m very proud of him. He is an intelligent person. He has shown that no Ijaw man can be led by the nose; he has always been his own man. I thank him and we are proud of him,” he added. The governor said medical personnel would soon be deployed in Comprehensive Health Centre, Arogbo.
