With its mechanical works 95 per cent completed, the Federal Government on Thursday spoke of the employment generation potential of the Modular Refinery in Ologbo, Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area of Edo State. A Senior Special Assistant to the President on Niger Delta Affairs, Edobor Iyamu, who led a federal team to assess the project, said it will, when completed, create jobs and reduce youth restiveness in the oil producing region. Iyamu lauded the Edo State government for ensuring that the modular refinery comes on stream, saying the establishment of the project in line with the new vision for the Niger Delta and to ensuring that the people benefit maximally from the wealth of the region. According to him, the project is aimed at promoting the establishment of modular refinery projects in the area to attract investment into the oil and gas sector. Chairman, Edo Refinery and Petrochemical Company, Mr. Michael Osime, represented by the Company’s Global Advisor, Frans Ojielu, said the company has the backing of the state with a N700 million project support fund. He said the 6,000-capacity barrels per day (bpd) plant also has a fabrication yard to boost local capacity to produce materials and provide a robust support for establishment of more modular refineries. Osime added that discussions are ongoing with the Ambrose Alli University to assist in the training of Nigerians for the oil and gas industries. He said: “In 2016, the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osibanjo embarked on the tour of the region where he met with key stakeholders to deliberate on how to improve the social economic wellbeing of the people of Niger Delta region, which is in line with the six-point agenda of Mr. President. This is one of the products of that tour.”
