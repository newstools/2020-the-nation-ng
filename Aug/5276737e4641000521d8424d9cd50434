 RIVERS State Governor Nyesom Wike has reconciled principal actors in the July 9, 2013, crisis in the House of Assembly. A statement by the Commissioner for Information and Communications Paulinus Nsirim said Chidi Lloyd; Michael Chindah; Evans Bipi and Kelechi Nworgu agreed to work together as members of one big family under Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The event took place on Tuesday at the Government House in Port Harcourt. Wike said: “They are the people directly involved in the crisis and this ceremony is to tell the world they have reconciled. They are still members of the same family and they are happy with the reconciliation”. Lloyd, who described the reconciliation as ordained by God, apologised to Chinda and others. He described his action in 2013 as a mistake of the head and not of the heart, and thanked Wike for his benevolence. Chindah thanked God for keeping them alive to witness the reconciliation. He praised Wike for his role in ensuring that he remained alive after the incident. He added that Lloyd’s misunderstanding of him led to the crisis, saying he had forgiven him since December 2013. Bipi described Lloyd as a man with a large heart and thanked him for coming back to his roots. Nworgu said the reconciliation was his greatest achievement in the present administration. PDP Chairman Desmond Akawor noted that the reconciliation was a practical manifestation of forgiveness. He lauded Wike for treading the path of a righteous ruler, and thanked parties in the reconciliation for taking the step to forgive.
