BBNaija Housemate Laycon has expressed undying affection for fellow Housemate, Erica, saying he would reject N3 million just to be with her. Laycon and Erica’s entanglement have become one of the highlights of the third week with Erica switching between Laycon and Kiddwaya. During a chat with Kaisha on their 19th day in the House, Laycon said he prefers to remain in the House to continually see Erica even though they might not be talking to each other. He said Erica and other Housemates are worth much more than N3million to him. “If I’m offered N3million to leave this house, I will reject it. Being in this House is worth more than that. I will stay back here for another week. I prefer to be here and see Erica often even though we won’t talk, talking to you (Kaisha) is worth more than N3million, seeing Wathoni even though she won’t talk to me is worth more than N3million,” he said. Laycon further said he wasn’t sure he would move on with another girl in the House as long as Erica is there. “It’s stupid to switch feelings, if I decide to move on with someone else that means I’m trying to make Erica jealous and that looks so stupid,” he told Kaisha. Laycon, Erica, and Kiddwaya have been involved in a love triangle that has kept viewers glued to their TV sets.
