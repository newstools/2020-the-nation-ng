MBAPPE  Kylian Mbappe is fit to start for Paris Saint-Germain against RB Leipzig in today’s Champions League semi-final in Lisbon, said  coach Thomas Tuchel. The French striker has been struggling with an ankle injury in recent weeks but he came off the bench to help PSG beat Atalanta in the last eight and has trained since that game last Wednesday. Mbappe, 21, came on last against Atalanta with his team trailing 1-0 to the Italian side but inspired PSG to a late victory, setting up the winner for Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting in injury time after Marquinhos had levelled in the 90th minute.  KLOPP Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has confirmed that he intends to step down from his Anfield post when his contract with the Premier League champions expires in 2024. The former Borussia Dortmund manager recently led Liverpool to their first ever Premier League title just a year after guiding the Reds to Champions League glory for the sixth time in the club’s history. Klopp is currently under contract at Liverpool until 2024, and the German has lifted the lid on his plans for when his deal runs out in four years’ time.  Recently crowned the Premier League Manager of the Season for the 2019-20 campaign.  SETIEN Barcelona have sacked Quique Setien as coach, the club confirmed yesterday, with Ronald Koeman the frontrunner to be his replacement. “The new coach will be announced in the coming days as part of a wide ranging restructuring of the first team,” Barca said on Twitter. Setien was only appointed in January but has paid the price for Barca surrendering the La Liga title to Real Madrid and then being humiliated by Bayern Munich in the Champions League. His exit was finalised during an emergency board meeting at Camp Nou, which lasted almost six hours and saw Koeman emerge as the favoured choice to take charge.  The club also announced next year’s presidential elections, scheduled for June, will be brought forward to March 15.
