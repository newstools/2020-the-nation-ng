 IJAW Women Connect (IWC),  has condemned what it termed negative commentaries in a section of the media on a former Minister of Petroleum, Mrs Diezani Alison-Madueke following her participation in a recent conference organised by the group. The group said it would not sit down and watch the ex-minister unduly vilified for adding her voice to a discourse that concerns the Ijaw nation. A statement signed by the President of IWC-Worldwide, Rosemary John-Oduone, described the alleged vilification of the embattled minister for her frank and audacious speech as unnecessary and uncalled for. “We shall never allow the press or indeed any organization to victimize any Ijaw woman especially our sister who we coaxed out of solitude to demonstrate the character and strength of the Ijaw woman at the conference.” ‘’The attention of the Ijaw-Women Connect (IWC)has been drawn to the several articles and coverage of our beloved and dear sister, Dr. Mrs. Diezani Alison-Madueke’s presentation at the inaugural global virtual conference of the Ijaw-Women Connect, in partnership with the  Ijaw-Nation Development Group (INDG), on Friday 7th August 2020. We hereby wish to state clearly that we will not stand by and watch as she is being mis-quoted and vilified in the eyes of the press as a result of her speech, which was frank, audacious and topical, addressing the decay of fatherhood in Ijaw land. “This event is by the Ijaw people; for the Ijaw people, to address Ijaw issues. It is by no means set out to be a platform for national discourse, bearing in mind that the outcome will also affect the nation positively. All guests are proud sons and daughters of Ijaw land, passionate about building a strong, vibrant, and successful community.”
