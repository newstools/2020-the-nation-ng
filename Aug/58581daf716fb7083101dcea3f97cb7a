Anchor Insurance Company Limited is fast rising as it grosses a premium of N5.1 billion in 2020 just as it achieved N4.2 billion premium income as at the end of 2019, its Managing Director, Mr. Augustine Osegha Ebose, has said. He spoke with  reporters  during a briefing in Lagos. He said the company was able to achieve this feat despite the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on business operations, noting that the underwriting organisation’s production would have been above N7 billion by now if the pandemic had not set in. Ebose said: “It was as if we foresaw the pandemic when we invested in most modern information technology to drive our business. So, it was not difficult for us to continue to navigate the insurance market using what we had already put in place and it has really helped in ensuring we never suffered any panic in this era of doing business differently. “The company, whose 2019 accounts have been approved by the National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) and Annual General Meeting (AGM) accordingly fixed for September 4, is not looking back at pushing up its premium income and attending to genuine claims requests with utmost concern.’’
