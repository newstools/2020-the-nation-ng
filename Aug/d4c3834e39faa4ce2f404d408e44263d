Four herders on Tuesday appeared in a Chief Magistrates’ Court in Makurdi charged with kidnapping and terrorism. The police charged  Haruna Haruna, Hassan Abubakar, Husseni Musa and Mohammed Abubakar with criminal conspiracy, kidnapping and acts of terrorism. Prosecution counsel Hyacinth Gbakor told the court that the case was transferred from the Area Command Headquarters, Otukpo for further investigation. Gbakor said a team of policemen acting on a tip-off, on July 8, arrested the defendants for unleashing mayhem on the people of Benue South. He alleged that the defendants kidnapped one Charles Ochapa of Ado Local Government on May 16, and collected ransom of N400,000 before releasing him. Gbakor claimed that during police investigation, the defendants voluntarily confessed to the crime and N300,000 was recovered from them. The defendants pleaded not guilty to the charge, and  Chief Magistrate, Mr Isaac Ajim, granted them bail. Ajim adjourned the matter until October 12, 2020 for further mention.
