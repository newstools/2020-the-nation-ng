Ekiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi has suspended the Headteacher of Methodist Girls High School, Ifaki-Ekiti, Mrs. Bolatito Adetutu, for allegedly abandoning her duty post. The governor visited the school to evaluate its preparedness for resumption but did not meet Mrs. Adetutu. A statement by Assistant Director of Information Kunle Adeniyi directed the headteacher to hand over  to the most senior assistant headteacher pending disciplinary action by the Teaching Service Commission (TSC). It reads: “Sequel to the reopening of schools for SS3 pupils, Governor Kayode Fayemi visited some public secondary schools to check their level of compliance with COVID-19 protocols. “At Methodist Girls High School in Ifaki-Ekiti, the principal was not available to receive the governor and his entourage, thus making the monitoring impossible, despite an earlier notice from the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology. “The commissioner for Education Science and Technology has directed that Mrs. Adetutu hand over the management of the school to the most senior vice principal and proceed on suspension immediately pending the conclusion of appropriate disciplinary action by the TSC.”
