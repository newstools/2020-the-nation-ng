 A PERSONAL Assistant to the President on Social Media, Lauretta Onochie, on Monday replied the Presiding Bishop of the Living Faith Church Worldwide (a.k.a Winners Chapel), David Oyedepo, for criticizing the Company and Allied Matters Acts (CAMA). The Federal Government seeks to regulate financial activities of local churches through CAMA. The cleric was reported to have rejected the terms of the CAMA, which proposes to appoint Trustees on the management of churches, saying it would be a direct assault on God by the nation. Oyedepo spoke during the Sunday service in his sprawling church auditorium, Ota, Ogun State. He was quoted as saying: “The church is God’s heritage on earth. Molest the wife of somebody and you will see the anger of that person. The church is the bride of Christ. You know how a strong man is when you tamper with his wife. The church is the body of Christ. We are under obligation to give warnings to wicked rulers so we could be free from their blood. “The church works on the pattern delivered by God not the pattern of man. Government has no power to appoint people over churches. This is a secular nation. The church is the greatest asset of God in this country. Please be warned. Judgment is coming. “The Lord says I have been still but now I will arise. Anybody that is in this deal is taking poison. This will never work. I am waiting for a day when anybody will appoint a trustee over this church…”
