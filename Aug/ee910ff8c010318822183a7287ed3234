 The Justice Court reality TV show has returned with new episodes for a second season. An Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) model for television, The Justice Court aims at delivering fair and speedy judgment in a courtroom setting. It is real both in concept and execution, dealing with real life judicial matters. In this new season, Justice Funmi Asaolu hears cases from litigants across all spheres of the society. These include high profile cases filed by some clergy and Nollywood stars. The cases are just so compelling and interesting that viewers can’t afford to miss any of the episodes. A sneak preview of last week’s edition reveals that a motorbike confiscated by the law enforcement agents during the coronavirus pandemic lockdown did not belong to the rider. The seizure generated a dispute that led to the intervention of Judge Funmi Asaolu in her characteristic firm, yet amiable judicial temperament. “The reality courtroom show provides people the opportunity to have access to speedy justice with the opportunity to tell their stories in their own words, rather than through counsel. Disputing parties have more control over the outcome because they are given the opportunity to negotiate in an environment that is not acrimonious,” Asaolu said.
