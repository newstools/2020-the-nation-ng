Former Ondo Commissioner for Arts, Culture, and Special Duties during the administration of former Governor Olusegun Mimiko, Mr. Femi Adekanmbi, has said the combined forces of the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) would not stop the re-election of Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu. Adekanmbi said the people of Ondo State would vote for a performing Governor than those he said were coming with experiments. Speaking in an interview in Akure, Adekanmbi said he resigned from the PDP for the APC to ensure the re-election of Governor Akeredolu. He urged candidate of the PDP, Eyitayo Jegede, to wait until it is the turn of the Central district to produce the Governor and allow the North to complete its eight years in power. Adekanmbi dismissed insinuations Ondo Deputy Governor, Agboola Ajayi, would pull unexpected strings at the polls. His words: “The Deputy Governor is pushing his luck too far. If the former Deputy Governor, Oluboyo, had gotten what Agboola is getting from Akeredolu’s administration, he would have been a happy man. “What does the Deputy Governor want Akeredolu to do for him? He was given all the political powers in the state. Akeredolu gave him a security vote and was even paying his wife. “Majority of the political decisions were taken by the Deputy Governor. The majority of the contracts in the South were through the Deputy Governor. “He is not a threat to Akeredolu. The Zenith Labour Party cannot withstand the APC. “The Central did eight years under Mimiko and for the governorship to go back to the Central Zone would be very unfair. “Talking about the Akure agenda, how many Akure indigenes are here? The majority of the people in Akure are foreigners. “All persons from all parts of the state are here. Jegede should wait and wait for his time. “How many of the over 260,000 votes in Akure do come out to vote? There are 160,000 votes in Owo. We have never recorded 100,000. Has Akure ever recorded 100,000 turn-outs?”
