 AIRLINES operators on Monday expressed excitement over the announcement of date of resumption of international flights, describing it as a welcome development. They said the announcement was long overdue following the ban on international flight since March 21. Speaking in a telephone interview, an industry operator said it was a good development for the sector, assuring that the local carriers  were prepared for the spin off effects that the return of international flights will have on domestic operations. Another operator, who declined to give his name, also expressed excitement over the return of the flights. Also speaking, an aviation expert, Mr. Tayo Ojuri, said it is a good decision at the right time, but expressed worry over the new protocols already in place by some countries. He expressed worry over the preparedness of the scheduled foreign carriers to fit into the plans by government in terms of airport protocols and other measures. He raised concerns over the compliance of equipment already installed at airports to eliminate human interface. He said there would be need for a simulation exercise to prepare passengers’ mind for the new normal. Ojuri said the authorities should put appropriate measures in place for testing and other processes  needed at the airport.
