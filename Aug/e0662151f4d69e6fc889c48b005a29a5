The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Wednesday released suspected cyber fraudster, Ismaila Mustapha, alias Mompha, about two weeks after he was re-arrested by the anti-graft agency in Lagos. The Nation learnt that Mompha subsequently directed his lawyer, Mr Gboyega Oyewole (SAN), to withdraw the N5m fundamental rights suit he filed against the EFCC to challenge his re-arrest. Mompha is standing trial at the Federal High Court in Lagos for allegedly laundering N32 billion. He pleaded not guilty and was granted bail. But the social media celebrity was re-arrested on August 14 when he went to the EFCC office in Ikoyi, Lagos to reclaim his five wristwatches, one Apple Air pod, one iPhone 8 mobile phone and one pair of sunglasses, seized from him by the anti-graft agency since last year. Mompha then sued the anti-graft agency for N5m, claiming that his re-arrest was unjustifiable and unlawful
