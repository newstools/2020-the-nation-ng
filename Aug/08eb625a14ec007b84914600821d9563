 RISING act Adeoye Akorede aka Koredianx has released his first single ‘JeJe’ under Jamika Entertainment. The release is coming after the budding music star won the label’s music contest. Koredianx describes his new single as an Afrobeats love song that expresses the patience needed in a relationship. The teenager featured another of the label’s star artists, Sultan a.k.a Afroboy on the song and they both attributed the ease of finding the chemistry to working on the track together because they have been friends since they were kids. When questioned about their experience of love and what inspired them for the song, the young men laughed and directed the question to their manager Stan, who interestingly said the teens were experiencing puppy love.
