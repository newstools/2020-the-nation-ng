 THE Social Democratic Party (SDP) has said comments of violence credited to a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr. Isaacs Kekemeke, will not scare it out of the October 10 governorship election. It said it was capable of matching up with Kekemeke. The party said it has members of Kekemekeâ€™s make and size. The governorship candidate of the party, Mr. Tope Fasua, who spoke in Akure, said Kekemeke should not have descended to make such threatening comments owing to the various political offices he (Kekemeke) had held in the state. He noted that the lesson is for politicians to always watch what they say in public or political gathering. Fasua urged Kekemeke to apologise to people. On the preparation by the electoral body, he said the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has no reasons to fail the people on October 10 because it is one state election.
