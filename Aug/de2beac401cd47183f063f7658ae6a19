TO update the knowledge of potential schools’ coaches and practising practitioners, a Lagos-based sports promotion outfit Dynaspro Promotion is partnering UK Sports Coaching (UKSC) in providing online training. UKSC and Dynaspro established a training partnership based on mutual understanding and to develop best practice within the UK and Nigeria. The training is aimed at adding value to Physical and Health Education (PHE) students and those currently teaching PE in schools by enabling them to have global experience, participation, recognition, exposure to modern training methods and certification.  For the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Dynaspro Promotion, Oluseyi Oyebode, the training is aimed at empowering coaches in schools to be at par with their counterparts across the globe. “It is an online training that involves visual training, curriculum development-based and will be broken into, assessment/records keeping, methods of teaching, planning of lessons, use of technology and resources. It will also give opportunities for simulation experience, which means travelling to the UK for classroom teaching and coaching experience. The programme will also enhance good development for online home training programs for schools in Nigeria which are the new global trends,” Oyebode said.
