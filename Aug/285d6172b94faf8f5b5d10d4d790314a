The Media Campaign Council of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has accused the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) of colluding with a retired senior official of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to rig the September 19 election. It also accused PDP leaders of failing to convince the residents to overlook the failure of the party’s governorship candidate. The campaign council through its Chairman, Prince John Mayaki, yesterday in an online statement said the retired senior official was forced out of INEC because of his bias. It alleged: “The retired senior official has been identified in a plot to trade sensitive information on the results collation process of the INEC with the PDP, in exchange for benefits. “The senior official initially refused to bow out of INEC, despite the expiration of his tenure at the commission, but he was forced out, following the revelation of his strong ties with the state government and his plot to stay put in INEC to gain access to sensitive information on the election. “The government discreetly named the senior official as a private consultant in the campaign, with a mandate to provide tactics and strategies, using his experience at INEC, on ways to manipulate the election and substitute real results obtained at the polling units with fake results, pre-written at the Government House, Benin.” The campaign council urged INEC to strengthen its infrastructure for the election against saboteurs. It enjoined the PDP to accept its looming defeat in good fate. PDP Publicity Secretary Chris Nehikhare was contacted on the phone for reaction. He promised to respond “very soon.” But he did not do so at press time.
