Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki has said power belongs to the people, not any man. He urged voters to come out en masse on September 19 and vote for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), to sustain the developmental strides of his administration. Obaseki spoke with party faithful at Ward 9 in Egbedo, during the continuation of his re-election campaign in Akoko Edo Local Government. He noted that the election would be about good and bad, as well as the future of youths. The governor received defectors from the All Progressives Congress (APC) at Ward 9, who supported his re-election. Obaseki said: “I promise to ensure that every child in Edo will have a skill by the time they finish junior secondary school and be able to work. We have introduced the Edo Basic Education Sector Transformation (EDOBEST) programme from primary one to six and by next year, we will focus on junior secondary schools. We will also focus on technical education, to ensure our youths become effective and contribute to the development of the state.”
