The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has condemned attacks on its members and supporters ahead of the September 19 governorship election in Edo State. It warned that the simplicity and meekness of its candidate, Governor Godwin Obaseki, must not be taken for granted. The Deputy Director-General of Edo PDP Campaign Council, Mr. Gideon Ikhine, speaking at Obaseki’s re-election campaign at Ora, Ward 6, Ovia South West Local Government, said: “Everywhere we go, they will go and destroy our campaign materials and sometimes beat up our supporters. “The laws and powers are in the hands of the governor. His simplicity should not be insulted. Is it because he is gentle? Our governor is gentle like Jesus Christ, but he will be re-elected like a lion.” Ikhine, who urged eligible voters in the area to vote for PDP and protect their votes for continuity, said PDP is sure of victory at the polls because of the number of trusted and reliable personalities it parades. He said: “Anybody planning to rig this election should have a re-think as Edo people are ready to defend their votes.”
