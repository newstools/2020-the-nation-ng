 BAYELSA State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Abuja has set August 15 to rule on an election matter. The suit is between Vijah Opuama of Liberation Movement and Independent National Electoral Commission  (INEC); Peoples Democratic Party (PDP); Governor Douye Diri and Deputy Governor Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo. Opuama is challenging the declaration of Diri and Ewhrudjakpo as governor and deputy governor. The case was initially dismissed as dead on arrival by PDP leaders but after a careful scrutiny, lawyers indicated otherwise. Opuama is seeking Ewhrudjakpo’s disqualification for irregularities in his academic qualifications and the cancellation of the election. He prayed the court to order a fresh election, saying the poll did not comply with the 1999 Constitution as amended. Since the judgment day was made public, anxiety seems to have pervaded the state. But Ewhrudjakpo said there was nothing to be afraid of. A statement by his media aide, Doubara Atasi, said: “Governor Ewhrudjakpo remains unruffled. There is nothing to be afraid of concerning the judgment. I believe the judiciary will do the right thing and as far as the right thing is done, there is nothing to be afraid of.”
