Inter Milan Lautaro Martinez has fired a warning to Sevilla ahead of Friday’s Europa League final, claiming his side are ‘ready for great things’. Martinez scored a brace and grabbed an assist as the Serie A side thrashed Shakhtar Donetsk 5-0 in the semi-final on Monday, with his strike partner Romelu Lukaku also netting two goals. Sevilla have won the competition a record five times and they beat Manchester United on Sunday to reach their fourth final in seven years. But Martinez is not threatened by the LaLiga side’s Europa League experience, insisting the Italians are ready for the challenge. ‘It was an incredible night, the kind we dreamed of,’ the striker told Sky Sport Italia after the game. ‘It had been a long time since I played that well, and in a semi-final we proved Inter are ready for great things. We’re ready for the final. ‘These goals give me so much, as there was a period when I wasn’t at my usual levels, but this experience helps you to grow. I am very happy with the way the team is playing and showing such character. ‘We’re getting better game by game and I am happy on a personal level too, as I am going to have my first child, so I dedicate the goals to my wife and family. ‘We just keep getting stronger, showing maturity with both young players and more experienced ones like Samir Handanovic, Danilo D’Ambrosio and Diego Godin. They point the way and we all follow.’ Martinez has scored 21 goals in all competitions during the 2019-2020 season while Lukaku has now scored in a record 10 successive Europa League matches. Friday’s final will take place at the RheinEnergieSTADION, the home of German side Cologne.
