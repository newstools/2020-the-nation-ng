Ekiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi is set to reshuffle his executive council. A letter to the Assembly, read by Speaker Funminiyi Afuye, requested the House to screen the governor’s seven nominees. They are Diran Adesua (Ekiti East); Prince Olabode Adetoyi (Moba); Olabimpe Aderiye (Ido Osi); Oye Filani (Ikole); Princess Iyabo Fakunle (Ilejemeje); Mrs. Mariam Ogunlade (Emure) and Akin Omole (Oye). Nominated for board positions are Prof. Femi Akinwunmi (SUBEB) and Febisola Adewale (Local Government Service Commission). Afuye told the nominees to submit 30 copies of their curriculum vitae before Friday, saying they would be screened next Tuesday. Fayemi’s Chief Press Secretary Yinka Oyebode said it was part of strategies to fortify the executive and inject new blood and ideas to develop the state. He said Fayemi would deliver on his mandate to bring economic prosperity to the people. Asked about those likely to be affected, Oyebode said: “Let us wait and see how the screening will end before talking about who will be affected. The essence of the exco reshuffle is to strengthen the government for better performance.”
