26-year-old Ozoemena Ozo Chukwu is bent on winning a second wager task for the Housemates after the first win under his leadership. On day 36, Ozo broke his record by emerging the first Housemate to win the title of Head of House for the second time. In the third week of the show, Ozo won the leadership mantle and steered the activities of Housemates into winning their first wager task since the show began on July 19. Two weeks after Ozo’s reign, the Housemates had continued to lose their wager tasks under the leadership of Erica/Kiddwaya and Kiddwaya/Tolanibaj. Upon his emergence as the house’s leader in the sixth week, Ozo and his Deputy for a second time, Nengi, have shown readiness to rally the housemates to win their wager task. “I hope everyone will be serious,” Ozo said as he discussed with Nengi. While Nengi and Ozo were having the discussion. Biggie notified them the storeroom was open and the art materials had been supplied ahead of the arduous task of creating befitting artwork for their wager task. Happy with Ozo’s reign, the 14 Housemates have been in a joyous mood as they prepared for their wager task. From little skits to jointly singing their favourite songs while they worked, they are determined to win the wager task for the second time. Already, the pressure is on Ozo by viewers and fans to lead the housemates to yet another victory. If not for additional shopping allowance, then to prove his first victory wasn’t a fluke.
