 THE Commissioner of Police (CP) in Edo, Mr. Johnson Kokumo, says the deployment of mobile policemen in Okpella, Etsako East Local Government, is to contain violence. The CP made the clarification in a phone interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Benin. He said: “The deployment is for security.” Since the deployment of the mobile policemen, the All Progressives Congress APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have been trading words on the development. While the APC has raised the alarm over the stationing of the policemen in a state government official’s home, the PDP has dismissed it, saying it was a normal routine police exercise.
