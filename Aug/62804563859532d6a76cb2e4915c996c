Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Mohammed Adamu has ordered commissioners of police to initiate actions to identify, isolate, disarm, arrest and prosecute individuals or groups in possession of prohibited arms. He said this is part of preparations for the coming governorship elections in Edo and Ondo states, as well as efforts by the police to curb the proliferation of prohibited firearms. A statement on Sunday in Abuja by the Force Public Relations Officer, DCP Frank Mba, said the directive became necessary against the backdrop of the deliberate arming and movement of political thugs and other criminals across the country. The statement said: “The directive is targeted at addressing the proliferation and unlawful possession of prohibited arms, which is contrary to Chapter F.28 LFN 2004 of the Firearms Act. “Commissioners of police in all states and the FCT have been directed to convene an enlightenment meeting of vigilance groups and quasi security outfits spread across the country to ensure that their activities are in conformity with the extant laws guiding their establishment and operations. “The IGP, observing that civil groups such as vigilance groups, quasi state and regional security outfits under guises are arming themselves with prohibited arms and weapons in contravention of the Firearms Act, notes that the trend, if unchecked, will pose threat to national security. “The IGP enjoins citizens to cooperate with the police in the enforcement of this order, as it is aimed at ensuring safety of lives and property.”
