COVID-19 affected 73.4 per cent of schools worldwide, with 1.2 billion pupils forced out, says a report by the Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG) and the Education Partnership (TEP) Centre. The Education Innovation Survey report was released during the launch of the TEP Centre, with the theme: Learning in a pandemic: Nigeria’s response to teaching and learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. TEP Centre Managing Director, Mrs. Modupe Adefeso-Olapeju, said the report was a culmination of several months of learning and interactions. According to her, TEP’s work covers learning, monitoring and evaluation, research and public-private dialogue, all aimed at improving the education sector. NESG Chief Executive Officer, Mr. ‘Laoye Jaiyeola, said the COVID-19 pandemic has had a severe impact on various sectors, including education. Head of Research of the TEP Centre, Ms. Bridget Azubuike, while presenting the report, added that access to digital tools and internet connectivity were some of the major challenges faced by students and parents during the COVID-19 pandemic. She said there is a need for more investment in infrastructure for virtual learning. The report’s recommendations include the need for “evidence-based learning; keeping children safe online, training and supporting parents and activating remote learning in tertiary institutions.” Founder of Slum2School Africa, Mr. Oroodam Otto, said there is a need for Nigeria’s education sector to be structured in a way to ensure that there is equity and equality for all pupils irrespective of their social background.
