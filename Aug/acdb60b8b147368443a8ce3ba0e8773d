Hours after Kiddwaya said his love affair with Erica won’t end in the House, their relationship seems to be heading to the rocks. Erica had asked Kiddwaya to stay away from her because he doesn’t support her publicly. She said Kidd allowed Wathoni disrespect her in public. The Housemates were having a general discussion when Erica stated she can’t and will never chase a man. Wathoni contributed by asking Kiddwaya if he didn’t chase any girl. Kidd replied saying he doesn’t chase girls. Kidd’s statement got Erica enraged so much that she left the garden in anger. Erica and Kiddwaya then left other housemates for the HoH lounge. On getting to the HoH lounge, Erica requested she and Kidd return to being just friends after claiming the 27-year-old never supports her in public. “What am I even doing with you? I feel very stupid for having anything to do with you in the first place. You’re being a hypocrite,” Erica began. “Her (Wathoni) behaviour makes me remember why I don’t like her in the first place. I know she doesn’t like me and I don’t like her. “She tries to throw shades but she never finishes anything. She gossips a lot, she tries to assume every time and then she tries to say stuffs to start a drama. “You also added to it. If I’m with somebody I expect the person to always be on my side. You’re always trying to be safe. “You don’t always have my back. In private you chat me but in public you try to sit on the fence. “Know where you want to stand and stand there is anybody going to beat you? You need to stand for one thing. You saw that she was trying to throw shade at me and you still fell for it.”
