Many would wonder how PrincessÂ  Vicky Haastrup, the wife of Osun State former Deputy Governor, Chief Adesuyi Haastrup, was able to climb the ladder of success high in her endeavours, but they are quick to forget that she has witnessed the grace of God through and through. Her sojourn in the oil and gas sector would certainly inspire anyone who wants to succeed in the industry. After conquering the oil and gas sector, she delved into the maritime industry. She faced her fair share criticism but replicated the same success to the chagrin of many of her detractors. With the courage and boldness of a lioness, the Chairman, Seaport Terminal Operators Association of Nigeria, confronted the challenge of running one of the most strategic terminals at the Lagos Port Complex Apapa in a male-dominated milieu. Interestingly, she stole the limelight and has since remained the toast of the port industry. Despite fame and fortune, Princess Haastrup recognises that only God is the unseen hand behind her success story; and she submits absolutely to His will. Little wonder, when she clocked 60 years last week Sunday, the day was dedicated to praise and worship to her creator.
