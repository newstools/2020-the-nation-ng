 NIGERIAN Army Officers Wives Association (NAOWA) at Elele Barracks in Rivers State has donated starter packs to 25 members trained in various skills. The beneficiaries are widows of deceased officers and youths. NAOWA Chairperson at 6 Division in Port Harcourt Mrs. Irefin Olayemi hailed the association for training the women and giving them starter packs. Olayemi, who was represented by Mrs. Chinelo Koughna, noted that the gesture was worthy of emulation and called on NAOWA in other areas and divisions to follow suit. NAOWA Zonal Coordinator Mrs. Imabong Essien encouraged beneficiaries to make judicious use of the skills they have acquired and the starter packs given to them to add value to their lives. The host, Mrs. Abimbola Adebimpe, said the ceremony was the fourth edition under her regime. She said it was to address poverty through education and training of vulnerable and marginalised group like women and children to position them to improve their familyâ€™s living condition. Beneficiaries included six widows, women and youths who trained in Information Communication Technology (ICT), hair dressing, catering services and fashion designing.
