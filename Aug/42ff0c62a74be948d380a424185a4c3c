Founder of INRI Evangelical Church Primate Babatunde Ayodele has taken a swipe at the leadership of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) for not preventing the emergence of the newly signed Company and Allied Matters Acts (CAMA) 2020. Ayodele spoke at the weekend during the presentation of two books on his previous and present prophesies from 1994 to date. He lamented CAN has suddenly become an appendage of government to the extent that it’s a lame duck that cannot bite. According to him, the association went to sleep when it was supposed to be a front-burner in kicking against the CAMA bill, which was recently signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari. “I do not believe in the leadership of CAN. It’s like the can of the soft drink you buy, drink and throw the empty can into the dust bin,” he fumed. The prophet also condemned Buhari for signing CAMA into law, noting it was the greatest error he would commit in the recent past. He said the government cannot implement the law because it is a clear declaration of war against the church. “Where is the government when l was building my church from the beginning? They now wanted to reap where they did not sow. “l see that the government is still sleeping, they will soon come out of their slumber,” he said. On COVID- 19, Ayodele pointed out that unless leaders come back to God who has a simple solution, the world will keep chasing a shadow. “Vaccine or no vaccine, the pandemic has come to stay, the only answer to this crisis is God. Without returning to him, all our leaders are just joking. No government in Nigeria wants the pandemic to go because they are feeding fat on it. There is enormous corruption woven round it. “All the world leaders have dared God and they must be ready to face the consequences,” he stated.
