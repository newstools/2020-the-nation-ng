The Adamawa State chapter of Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has held a prayer session for the state chairman, Bishop Stephen Dami Mamza. Bishop Mamza was widely lauded on Sunday when he issued a statement announcing that he had tested positive for COVID-19, a move considered unique in a state where no prominent individual has made his status public since the beginning of the pandemic. During the prayer session at the CAN Secretariat in Yola, clerics hailed Bishop Mamzaâ€™s courage in declaring his status and advised other prominent people to do the same and help convey the reality of COVID-19 to curb spread. Bishop of the Anglican Diocese of Yola Most Rev Ibrahim Markus, who delivered the lead sermon of the prayer session, said God would answer the prayers of the elders, who gathered for the CAN chairman because such is the will of God.
