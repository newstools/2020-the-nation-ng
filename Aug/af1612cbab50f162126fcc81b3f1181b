Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu on Monday came hard on his predecessor, Dr. Olusegun Mimiko. He said his predecessor abandoned projects begun by the late Olusegun Agagu. Akeredolu said the seaport project envisioned by the late Agagu was abandoned by Mimiko. He said it would have become a reality if Mimiko had continued with the vision. The governor said Mimiko also abandoned the Olusegun Agagu University of Science and Technology (OAUSTEC), Okitipupa, adding that he left six months unpaid salaries. He said he would defeat candidates from other parties in the October 10 governorship election. Akeredolu, who spoke during the launch of distribution of palliatives donated by the Coalition Against COVID-19 (CACOVID), promised to complete the seaport before the end of his second term. He said over 200,000 households have received palliatives since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. Akeredolu said besides the most vulnerable that got palliatives, patients, expectant mothers and nursing mothers also received palliatives. He said the items donated by CACOVID would get to 50,000 households. The governor said: “We have been forced by COVID-19 outbreak to review downward our budget, just like every other state and the Federal Government. But God Almighty has made it possible for us to pay salary and implement programmes. “Let us not be in doubt that a new foundation has been laid for Ondo while the sun is shining. Port Ondo is on the way. By the grace of God, I will complete it. “If previous governments had shown concern, we would have had a seaport. Agagu started it, but we had a government that abandoned it.” “That government abandoned OAUSTEC, Okitipupa.
