Imo State governor, Hope Uzodinma, on Friday commissioned some major road projects in the state which were started few months after he assumed office. Some of the roads are St Moore, Aladinma, Oparanozie and Douglas Road which is a two- lane road linking the state to Aba, Enugu and other Southeast states. Speaking during the road commissioning ceremony, Chairman, Njemanze Ruling Dynasty, Prince Declan Njemanze, expressed gratitude to the governor particularly for reconstructing the Douglas Road which he said was abandoned by the previous government. Njemanze recalled that Douglas Road was impassable throughout the tenure of Rochas Okorocha, adding that residents of Owerri as result suffered untold hardship plying the road. He lauded the governor on his promise of rebuilding their ancestral market (Eke Ukwu) which he said was demolished by the Okorocha’s administration. Reacting to the speech made by the elder statesman, Uzodinma assured the people that  his administration had come to reduce their  sufferings through provision of  such quality roads, revamping the health sector and providing them with clean water through rehabilitation of the Otamirri water scheme.
