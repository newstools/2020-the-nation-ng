Rangers’ manager Steven Gerrard has revealed Joe Aribo was omitted from their 0-0 draw with Livingston in Sunday’s Scottish Premiership game due to injury. The midfielder suffered a knock during one of their training sessions ahead of the game and did not recover in time to feature for the Gers at Ibrox Stadium. Gerrard is, however, hoping to welcome the Nigeria international back to his squad when they face Kilmarnock in their next league game. “He has a little knock. We are hoping to have him available next weekend. It was too risky to do it [against Livingston],” Gerrard was quoted as saying by Glasgow Times.  Aribo teamed up with the Ibrox Stadium outfit last summer after leaving Charlton Athletic and has been a prominent member of the Gers.  His compatriot Leon Balogun is also currently out injured and missed their clash against Livingston at Ibrox Stadium. The Super Eagles defender teamed up with the Gers in July after ending his stay with Wigan Athletic and has been rock solid for Rangers before he suffered an injury against St. Johnstone.
