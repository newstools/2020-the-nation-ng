Eight-time Olympic gold medallist Usain Bolt has confirmed he is in self-isolating as he awaits the result of a coronavirus test. The 34-year-old Jamaican, who retired from sprinting in 2017, revealed that he is in quarantine as a precaution, despite having no symptoms. Speaking in a video posted on social media, Bolt said: “Good morning everybody. Just waking up and like everybody, checked social media and saw that social media’s saying I’m confirmed to have Covid-19. “I did a test on Saturday, because I have work. I’m trying to be responsible, so I’m gonna stay in and stay here for my friends. Also I’m having no symptoms, so I’m going to quarantine myself and wait on the confirmation to see what is the protocol on how I should go about quarantining myself from the Ministry of Health. “Just to be safe, I’ll quarantine myself and just take it easy.”
