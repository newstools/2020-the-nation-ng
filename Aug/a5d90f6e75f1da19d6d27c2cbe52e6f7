The Ariston Comfort Challenge – Greenland Mission has premiered in Nigeria. It was filmed from the beginning to end in the form of a web-series through the Challenge’s official website and is available on YouTube. Ariston, an international brand in the Ariston Thermo Group, said the global campaign highlights its mission to take sustainable comfort to even where it seems impossible to find. The Ariston Comfort Challenge focused on ensuring that thermal comfort could reach anywhere in the world. Through the mission, Ariston donated a warm shelter to a group of scientists from the University of Copenhagen involved in climate change studies in the remote and icy Island of Disko, in Greenland (Arctic).  Speaking during a virtual media parley in Lagos, Mr Gaurav Bisaria, the Director, Central Africa, Ariston Thermo Group, explained that a safe and sheltered house, heated and provided with hot water for the maximum comfort even during Polar winters would have not been possible without the firm’s commitment to quality. He said the Ariston Comfort Zone, an innovative modular home, was shipped to and assembled—for the first time— in Disko Island, one of the coldest regions in the world.  Bisaria said before this time, it proved near impossible for the scientists to stay on the island for more than a few days due to the harsh weather conditions. “Thanks to the mission, Ariston brand had the chance to give evidence to its product quality, capable of working even in extreme conditions,” he said.
