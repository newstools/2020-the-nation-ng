 Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde has flagged off the remodelling of Lekan Salami Sports Complex, Adamasingba, Ibadan, to be at par with international standards. Makinde, during the flag-off, held at the main bowl of the stadium, noted that the event was a step in the right direction to positioning the state to attract investments. The remodelling is estimated to gulp about N5.5billion and to be funded through the Alternate Project Funding Approach (APFA). The governor said his administration would double its efforts to put the infrastructure in place that would support the growth of IGR in the state and that he would create an avenue for everyone to feel the real dividends of democracy.  Makinde said: â€œExperts all over the world have predicted that there would be a period of economic hardship post-COVID-19. In fact, if you have been following the news, you would have heard about a few countries that are already heading towards a recession. Similarly in his address, the representative of Messrs Peculiar, the contractor handling the project, Olarenwaju Adeleke hinted that the benefit that would be derived from remodelling of the stadium would be unquantifiable, bearing in mind the stadium was planned to be a place of discovery and nursing of talents. He disclosed that the present capacity of the stadium which was put at 8,000 would be increased by 25 per cent which would be put at 10,000 capacity, adding that all existing facilities in the stadium would also be upgraded and accredited for national and international tournaments.
