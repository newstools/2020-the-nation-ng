 THE five communities making up Aguleri in Anambra East Local Government have demanded the removal of two monarchs, who were part of the Abuja trip. Governor Willie Obiano is from Aguleri. Obiano last week suspended 12 monarchs for visiting President Muhammadu Buhari in Abuja without permission. The protesters carried placards and marched round Aguleri, urging Obiano to remove the monarchs for ‘’committing sacrilege with their actions’’. A popular roundabout,  Otuocha, was blocked, causing a gridlock. Spokesman and President-General of Aguleri Chief Chidi Onwuegbune said the protest was to let the world know that the rulers went to Abuja without their people’s consent. He said: “Our people were taken aback at the unbecoming conduct of the royal fathers. They embarked on a journey to Abuja with Prince Arthur Eze without telling our people and the government. “Although they have already been suspended by the Traditional Rulers’ Council and government, we know that the world is watching to see what our position on the matter is. We are not part of the action. We condemn their actions, which portrayed our community in a bad light, especially as the governor is our son.”
