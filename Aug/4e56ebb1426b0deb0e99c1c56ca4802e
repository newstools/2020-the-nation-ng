 HOST communities of Operating Mining Licence (OML) 79 in Ekeremor and Southern Ijaw local governments of Bayelsa State have denounced threats to operators of the licence. They called on the Federal Government, Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) and other stakeholders to ignore a protest and 21-day ultimatum to operators by a section of the communities. Community leaders and elders, under the Concerned Citizens of Kou, Iduwini, Bassan West, and Mein Clan of SPDC EA Communities, told Shell to continue with its operations in the area. They hailed Shell for keeping to its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in line with the General Memorandum of Understanding (GMoU) guiding OML 79 operations. A statement by its spokesman, Chief Paul Oweipade, accused some influential members of the communities of trading off jobs and contracts meant for indigenes. It reads: “We urge SPDC and its joint ventures to disregard any purported 21-day ultimatum as the firm has fulfilled its CSR to the communities regarding OML 79. “Sadly, it is regretting that while SPDC had done its part in the implementation of the CSR under community content, some community members, in connivance with the cluster board chairmen, have traded off jobs and contracts meant for the communities to non-indigenous contractors. “SPDC and its JV have, in their CT Agreement, implemented the 10 vessels supply contracts, Automotive Gas Oil (AGO), supply; waste management, potable water supply, employing indigenes under FOD, though they have been placed on sit-at-home salary due to the attitude of the cluster board leaders…”
