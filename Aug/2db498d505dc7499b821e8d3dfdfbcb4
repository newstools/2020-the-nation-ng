Paramount ruler of Seimbiri Kingdom in Delta state, His Majesty (Dr.) Charles Ayemi-Botu, has called on the Minister for Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, to resign over alleged misappropriation of funds in the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). The monarch, who is a former national chairman of the Traditional Rulers of Oil Minerals Producing Communities of Nigeria, (TROMPCON), at a media conference in Warri, described the continuous stay of the minister in the Federal Executive Council as a “smear” on the anti-graft war by President Muhammadu Buhari. Adding his voice to calls from several stakeholders demanding for Sen. Akpabio’s replacement, the royal father said it will douse growing tension in the already volatile Niger Delta region. According to him, the minister’s recent accusations of former governors, members of the National Assembly and his own appointee in the Interim Management Committee (IMC) of the NDDC, portrays him as a “drowning man, neck deep in corruption”. “This is a clarion call to President Buhari to sack the Minister for Niger Delta Affairs, without further delay in order to forestall the impending, looming crisis that may worsen the already down trodden economy of the country, so as to avoid total collapse. “He has either by commission or omission tarnished the good image of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) as a serving minister and smeared the President, who is championing the anti-graft crusade in Africa. “We passionately appeal to our dear son to follow the path of hon our and resign honorably, than to be booted out by our no nonsense President,” the traditional ruler stated.
