Amolegbe’s investiture, the 11th in the series, will be done online in line with the COVID-19 protocols, marks the formal handing over from Mr Adekoje, who shall decorate the new President with the paraphernalia of office. The institute’s investiture is a high profile ceremony that attracts top level dignitaries, including heads of state, governors, regulators and other technocrats in the financial market. A fellow of the institute, Amolegbe, is an accomplished economist, consummate stockbroker, investment analyst and asset manager, with over 28 years’ experience in the finance industry, covering virtually all aspects of the business at various levels.
