Oyo Governor Seyi Makinde has Monday sacked his Commissioner for Works, Infrastructure and Transport, Professor Raphael Afonja. The Governor communicated the sack in a letter dated August 10, 2020 by the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Mrs. Olubamiwo Adeosun. The termination of appointment takes immediate effect, according to the letter. The letter entitled “Termination of appointment” reads in part: “I wish to convey the approval of His Excellency, Governor Seyi Makinde, on the termination of your appointment as Honourable Commissioner, with immediate effect. “Consequent upon the above development, you are hereby directed to hand over all the government items in your possession to the Permanent Secretary (Ministry of Works, Infrastructure and Transport). “I am to add that, your contribution within the time of your sojourn is appreciated and commendable, and therefore, wish you successes in your future endeavours. I thank you.” The sacked commissioner recently tested negative for coronavirus after 52 days of treatment in isolation and had hoped to resume work on Monday. Makinde also approved redeployment of two Commissioners, who were asked to swap portfolios. An internal memo signed by the SSG with the subject: “Redeployment of EXCO members” indicated Commissioner for Special Duties, Chief Bayo Lawal, has been moved to the Ministry of Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs while Mrs. Funmilayo Orisadeyi is to move the other way.
