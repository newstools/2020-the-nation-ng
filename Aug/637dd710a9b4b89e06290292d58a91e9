PEP Guardiola has been spotted in Barcelona as speculation grows over a move to Manchester City for Lionel Messi. The wantaway forward is supposedly close to agreeing a £1.4m-a-week deal at the Etihad. Messi made his intentions clear earlier this week when he sent Catalan chiefs a Burofax signalling his desire to leave.  And a reunion with Guardiola coupled with their financial might makes City favourites for his signature. Spanish outlet  El Chiringuito  believe Guardiola  could meet Messi for a face-to-face meeting during his time in the city. The pair have already had discussions on the phone regarding teaming up for a second time.
