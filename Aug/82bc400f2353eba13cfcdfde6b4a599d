 A former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Dr Obadiah Mailafia, has received a fresh summons from the police for questioning. He is to report at the Force headquarters, Abuja on Monday. The Police said they are “investigating a case in which your name featured prominently,” hence the summons. The letter signed by Deputy Commissioner of Police (Admin) DCP Umar Mamman Sanda for Deputy Inspector-General of Police, Force Criminal Investigation Department, Abuja, reads: “I refer to my letter No CR: 3000/X/FHQ/ABJ/Vol.244/245 dated 15th August, 2020 on the above subject matter and wish to inform you that this office is investigating a case in which your name featured prominently.  “In the light of the above, you are invited for an interview with the Deputy Inspector General Inspector-General of Police, Force Criminal Investigations Department, Abuja through the undersigned on Monday 24th August, 2020 by 11am at Room 407, 3rd Floor, Force Criminal Investigations Department complex, Area 10, Abuja. “Accept the assurances of the Deputy Inspector-General of Police, Force Criminal Investigations Department high regard, please.” Mailafia confirmed the invitation on the phone yesterday. He said: “Yes, the police were in my house this afternoon. At first, they looked intimidating, but they told me they brought a letter. I am being summoned to be at the Force Headquarters on Monday for criminal investigation.” Mailafia was recently invited twice by the Plateau State Office of the Department of State Services (DSS) for questioning following his allegation in a radio interview that a northern governor is a  Boko Haram commander
