Youth and Sports Development Minister, Sunday Dare, has canvassed for support in the Oyo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), declaring that unity was more important than personal ambition. Speaking at a stakeholders meeting of Oyo APC, in Ibadan, Dare charged party leaders on the need to reposition the APC for victory in the state. The Minister urged that the APC in Oyo must embrace a more inclusive and collegial mentality while the fragmentation of the party and the unfair treatment of members associated with a rival faction must stop. He said only a strong unified party can win elections and that the idea of handing the party over to a few individuals, to the detriment of others, would spell doom as the factional elements might win the battle for supremacy in the party but may well lose the greater war which is the general elections. The conference noted that the crisis experienced by the party was made protracted by the entrenchment of camps and factional interests. After extensive deliberations on the remarks by the sports ministerâ€™s remarks, stakeholders resolved to let go of the past and work together to restore the fortunes of the APC in the state. They commended Dare for his initiative at convening the meeting and urged him to continue with the mediation efforts he has initiated with a view to uniting all factions and camps in Oyo APC. In attendance were the former Deputy Govenor, Otunba Moses Alake-Adeyemo, House of Representatives members, Shina Peller, Musiliu Akinremi, Akeem Adeyemi, Niyi Akintola (SAN), former Speakers, Oyo State House of Assembly, Asimiyu Alarape, Olagunju Ojo, among others.
