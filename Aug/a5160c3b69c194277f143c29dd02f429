The Police in Ogun State have arrested an Islamic teacher, Ismaila Saheed, 38, and one Toliha Sabith, 20 for alleged defilement of a 15-year-old girl (names withheld). They were arrested weekend by detectives attached to Redeemed Camp Police Station after the victim reported that the duo raped her on August 25, at Mowe. According to the police, the victim reported that she was first raped by Sabith at Imedu_nla in Mowe and went confide in her Islamic teacher who also took advantage of her under the guise of helping her remove an imaginary pregnancy gotten from the first defilement. “She said she was raped by Sabith and she went to her Islamic and Arabic teacher to tell him about it. Having listened to her ordeal, the Arabic teacher Ismaila Saheed told her that she might have gotten pregnant as a result of the incident and he offered to help her remove the said pregnancy. “Surprisingly, instead of removing the imaginary pregnancy, he also had carnal knowledge of her, after which he inserted a sharp object into her private part causing her a serious vaginal injury,” said police spokesman Abimbola Oyeyemi in a statement yesterday. Consequent upon her report, the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) Bala Yakubu was said to have detailed operatives to go after the culprits who were eventually apprehended on Friday. They were said to have confessed to the crime and would be transferred to the Anti-Human Trafficking and Child Labour unit of the State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID) for further action. Oyeyemi said the victim has been admitted in a hospital for proper care.
