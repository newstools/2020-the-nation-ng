Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has urged the Alara of Ilara, Epe, Olufolarin Ogunsanwo, to provide leadership, promote cooperation, friendship and the spirit of togetherness. Sanwo-Olu spoke on Sunday at the installation and presentation of staff-of-office to Ogunsanwo. The governor noted that monarchs were indispensable partners of government due to their roles as agents of development, promoters of peace and peaceful co-existence. He promised that ‘as a government, we will continue to partner with you and ensure that your welfare is accorded the attention it deserves’. “I rejoice with you as you ascend the stool of your ancestors. Your choosing and acceptance by your people to lead them is a reflection of their trust and confidence in your ability to positively impact the fortune of this landscape and its people. “Rest assured of this administration’s commitment to the fulfilment of our promise to spread infrastructure to all parts of the state, including Epe Division.” The governor urged the people to support Ogunsanwo so that his reign would be glorious.
