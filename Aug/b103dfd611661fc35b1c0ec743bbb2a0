 THE Department of State Services (DSS) on Sunday said it lost two of its personnel in an alleged attack by members of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) in Enugu State. Public Relations Officer, Dr Peter Afunanya, in a statement, said the killers would be brought to justice According to the agency, its patrol team was attacked by IPOB members in Emene. The statement reads: “The Service lost two personnel in what was clearly an unprovoked violent attack launched by IPOB on the team. “The Service hereby condoles with families of the departed officers and also prays for the repose of their souls. “However, all measures have been put in place to ensure that their killers and everyone involved in this dastardly act are promptly apprehended and brought to justice. Consequently, a full-scale investigation will be carried out with regard to the incident. “Once again, the Service reaffirms its commitment to assiduously work with other security agencies to maintain public safety and order. “It, therefore, urges law law-abiding citizens and residents to go about their normal businesses without fear.” IPOB had claimed its harmless members were unarmed and therefore could not have killed anyone.
