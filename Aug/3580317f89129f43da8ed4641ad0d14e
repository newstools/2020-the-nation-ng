Nollywood actress Yvonne Jegede has joined the growing list of female directors in Nigeria. Jegede made her directorial debut in Nollywood with two short films, ‘Separation’ and ‘Wife Of The Year.’ According to a statement from her management, Jegede worked with BBNaija ex-housemate, Sir Dee, Sandra Eze, Janice Joseph, Amira Aregbe on the projects. On her directorial debut, Jegede said, “As an actor, your input into the final output of a movie is pretty little because the audience only gets to see what the director sees. This is the reason I ventured into directing because I have a lot more to offer in the final output of a movie. Directing movies is an expression of my art which I’ve always wanted to venture into but I just didn’t have the courage and time to but after the lockdown eased, I took it upon myself to direct some short films before my first feature film and I really can’t wait for you all to see what my team and I put together for you guys.”
