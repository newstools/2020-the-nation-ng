Wife of the Edo State Deputy Governor, Mrs. MaryAnn Shaibu, has hailed the Supreme Court for upholding the right of female children to inherit their fathers’ properties. “This judgment has restored the pride of place of female children,” she said. Mrs. Shaibu said most of the customary laws that are anti-female are in conflict with the nation’s law. She assured the women that they can now aspire to the highest height of their dream. Said she: “The dark roof that has hindered our women from political and socio-economic relevance has been broken and Edo women will demonstrate this in the coming September 19 governorship election by voting en masse for Governor Godwin Obaseki and Comrade Philip Shaibu on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), to actualise their aspiration.” Wife of the Edo State Deputy Governor, Mrs. MaryAnn Shaibu, has hailed the Supreme Court for upholding the right of female children to inherit their fathers’ properties. “This judgment has restored the pride of place of female children,” she said.
