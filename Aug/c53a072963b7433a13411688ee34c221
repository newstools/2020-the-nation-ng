Katsina State Governor Aminu Bello Masari has lauded a private sector-led initiative, Coalition Against COVID-19 (CACOVID), for donating assorted food items to 67,106 vulnerable households. Masari, who spoke during the kick-off of the distribution of the food items, said the gesture would go a long way to provide succour to the beneficiaries. He said: “The resources, which were budgeted for developmental project in the state were equally diverted toward containing the pandemic and the management of the victims, despite the support received. “I was made to understand that a total of 67,106 most vulnerable households are earmarked to benefit in this state.” He thanked others who had made donations to the state Committee on COVID-19, assuring that necessary measures would be put in place to ensure that the items get to the right beneficiaries. He said: “The donation of hospital equipment and materials, which facilitated the take-off of one of our isolation centres and the donation of assorted food items for distribution to 67,106 vulnerable households across the 34 local government councils of the state, represents a landmark involvement of CACOVID in the fight against the pandemic in Katsina State.’’ Some of the items to be distributed include bags of rice, maize, cartons of noodle and others.
