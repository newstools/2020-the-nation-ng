Kiddwaya has been asked to take over affairs of the House for the next few days as Biggie goes on a secret vacation. The instruction came shortly after Kiddwaya emerged the Head of House on Monday, August 17. 27-year-old Kiddwaya and TolaniBaj have been saddled with the duties of Biggie, who revealed that he will be going on vacation so his voice will be missing in the House for the next few days. Biggie, however, instructed Kiddwaya to ensure activities in the House are managed diligently and no Housemate must know about Biggie’s secret vacation. “Big Brother has decided to go on a short vacation. For the next few days, the House will be without Big Brother’s voice. During this period, you and your deputy must manage the affairs of the house diligently but this is the easy part. “The difficult part of this exercise is keeping this information secret from the House. Big Brother does not want the House to know about the vacation. “It is very likely that Housemates will notice the absence of Big Brother’s voice. Should this happen, you can tell your fellow Housemates any story you feel necessary.” Kiddwaya’s personal task from Biggie is coming as a secret mission and a twist in the show that has lasted for five weeks and 29 days.
