 FIFTY youths in Abia State have received funding from a Non-Governmental Organisation, Connak Foundation, after receiving training in various vocations. The foundation disbursed N40 million to them after the training. Speaking during the disbursement of the 2019 Connak Foundation Youth Entrepreneurship Initiative, Chief Executive Officer Mrs. Carole Emeka-Sunday said it was to empower youths not to depend on white-collar jobs for survival. Mrs. Emeka-Sunday said beneficiaries were trained in Information Communication and Technology, leather works, fashion design, auto- mechanic, furniture making, confectionery and food processing. She said: “In 2019, we carried out free medical and surgical services. Over 5,000 persons from the immediate community, the state and other states of Southeast, Southsouth and other parts of the country were treated free.” Mrs. Emeka-Sunday said plans were underway to train and empower more youths. In 2012, the NGO kicked off a “revolving loan” to widows and indigent women and later upgraded its intervention to skill acquisition,  scholarships and other empowerment and philanthropic schemes, including drilling of a borehole at the William Memorial and Adanma Okpara Secondary School and free medical care.
