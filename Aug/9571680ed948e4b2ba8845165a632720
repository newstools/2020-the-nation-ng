The Ogun State government has promised to renovate dilapidated schools in boundary communities ravaged by herdsmen. Special Adviser on Public Communication to the governor Remmy Hazzan promised that the government would either renovate or rebuild old structures. In a telephone conversation, Hazzan said: “Part of our development agenda is revamping the educational infrastructure. We reckon that existing schools are a legacy we should preserve rather than building new ones if not necessary. “In Ipokia Local Government, for instance, the last time the school was renovated was during former Governor Olusegun Osoba’s administration in 2000. So, the essence of our infrastructural plan is to renovate such or mark some for reconstruction. “As at the end of the first year of this administration, we mapped out and have started work on about 680 schools… We will be starting another phase of this which includes over 1,000 schools by August 31.” The government yesterday declared COVID-19 test free for returning SS3 pupils in private and public schools. It ordered testing centres to begin the free tests, and directed a refund to those who had paid. Governor Dapo Abiodun, in a statement, stepped down the COVID-19 test as a mandatory requirement for returning pupils. “…the health of our children remains our priority. However, in view of the number of boarding pupils (5,340 private and 500 public), and … our 500 limit of testing capacity per day, it may not be feasible for all boarding pupils to get tested and get their results prior to resumption or before …exams on August 17. “Consequently, the government has stepped down the COVID-19 test as a mandatory requirement for returning pupils in exit classes. The admittance of pupils into boarding house in private schools will be at the discretion of the management and the Parent Teacher Association (PTA) of such schools.”
