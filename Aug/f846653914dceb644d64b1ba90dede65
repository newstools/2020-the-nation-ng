The Northern Governors Forum has condemned the recent attacks in Southern Kaduna, which left 21 dead in four Atyap villages in Zangon Kataf Local Government Area (LGA) of Kaduna State. Dr. Simon Mancha, Director of Press and Communication Affairs to Chairman of the Forum, Simon Lalong, said the persistent attacks on villages in the area despite efforts by the Kaduna State Government and security agencies raise serious concerns and condemnation. The Governors said the recent attacks show desperate attempts by criminal elements to not only cause pain and sorrow among innocent citizens but also frustrate the efforts of the Kaduna State Government at fostering peace and harmony. According to them: “We are deeply saddened by this cycle of violence and blood-letting that is carried out against unarmed and helpless people. “This is reprehensible and regrettable. While we call on the security agencies to rise up to the occasion and apprehend these criminals, we also encourage the citizens to assist with relevant intelligence that will lead to the arrest of these blood thirsty people.” They maintained any group or individual aggrieved for whatsoever reason should seek redress through official channels than resort to self-help which only exacerbates crises and instability. The Forum commiserated with the victims of the crises and Government of Kaduna State, pledging its support to Governor Nasir El-Rufai as he works with all stakeholders to bring the incessant crises to an end.
