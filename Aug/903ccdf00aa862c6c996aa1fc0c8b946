 SINGING duo, ItsENJ, have recently released the video to their new song, ‘Pray for it'(PFI). Directed by Naya Effectz, the song features the blood brothers and their collaborator on the song, CKay. The song is off the duo’s upcoming debut Extended Project(EP), ‘Born on the Moon’. Speaking on their collaborations, the brothers said “Our biggest single out now features CKay. We have had the opportunity to discuss music with Olamide, Zoro, and put together a project with Mykah. Foreign interest in African music today has grown since the time we arrived in the US in 2002…” Both singers, Emmanuel Chimdindu Odumego and Charles John Odumego fell in love with music after moving to New York. “We grew up as the middle boys out of 4 children, with a sister as the first and another sister as the last born. We were Born in Abapka, Enugu Nigeria, and migrated to the North Bronx, New York City(NYC) with our family in 2001. Our family is a catholic working-class family. We grew up as very innovative and inquisitive young boys, which led to us designing, drawing, and building race cars/clubhouses out of scraps we found around the neighborhood. From building things, we picked interest in music, then it was history from there. ItsENJ has been doing music as recording artists for about a year. But we have been producing music for over 7 years. “As a collective, we decided to start singing 2019 after we opened for Olamide at his “OLIC 2018” concert in Amazura Queens, NYC, ” said ItsENJ.
