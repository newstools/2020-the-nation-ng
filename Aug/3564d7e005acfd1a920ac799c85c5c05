Political parties participating in Saturday’s local government elections in Ondo State on Tuesday inspected sensitive materials at the office of the Ondo Independent Electoral Commission (ODIEC). The sensitive materials inspected included ballot papers for chairmanship and councillorship election, statement of results at polling units, declaration of results, and Certificates of Return for chairman, vice chairman and councilors. A total of 316 packs containing the sensitive materials were inspected. Chairman of ODIEC Prof. Yomi Dinakin, who addressed representatives of political parties while displaying the sensitive materials said the materials, would be taken to a secured location after the briefing. Prof. Dinakin urged the political parties to be vigilant and ensure their agents were present during distribution of the materials on Thursday. Dinakin challenged them to report back if the materials did not get to the polling units. The ODIEC urged them to raise alarm if anybody is smuggling doctors results to the polling units. His words, “We called you to see availability of these materials and not a census. We have more than enough. They are as they were brought from where they were produced. We are not here to take a census of the materials. “Immediately you leave now, they will be taken back to a secured location. We have spoken with and sought the cooperation of security agencies. They assured us that their officers and men will be available to guard these materials. The materials are safe. We know they are sensitive and they have not been released to anybody.” Those who spoke warned on the consequences of the sensitive materials not getting to polling units.
