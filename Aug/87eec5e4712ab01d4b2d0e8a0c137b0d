 The Benin Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture has endorsed the candidature of Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The President, Mrs. Helen Atekha-Odemwingie, who led a team of executive members that received the candidate at a forum in Benin City, said they have scrutinised his manifesto and are confident that his policies and programmes will solve the challenges confronting industrial and economic growth. She stressed the importance of reviving the industrial sector to provide jobs and promote economic growth, and urged residents to elect Pastor Ize-Iyamu because his plans to boost commerce, agriculture and industrialisation are sound and practical.  Ize-Iyamu, who thanked the chamber for its endorsement, expressed his disappointment with the Governor Godwin Obaseki administration for its neglect of the industrial sector and its poor management of important factors meant to encourage investments and drive economic growth. He assured the members of his commitment to rebuild infrastructure and strengthen security to attract investments, support women operating local and small scale businesses to boost the economy and eradicate poverty. The APC candidate called for continuous support and partnership and presented copies of his SIMPLE agenda manifesto, saying the document represents a binding agreement between him and the people if elected as the next governor.
