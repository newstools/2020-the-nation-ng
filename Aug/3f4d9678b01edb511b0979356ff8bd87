The All Progressives Congress (APC) has asked Governor Godwin Obaseki to make out time for governance. It said Edo State was on automatic pilot, with Obaseki not having time for governance, but very busy with propaganda. APC, through its National Vice Chairman, Media Campaign Council, Partick Obahiagbon, at a news conference in Benin, accused the governor of engaging in swashbuckling threats to APC members and placating members of his Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who it noted had since turned him (Obaseki) into an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). It said: “Obaseki, in a smash and grab stratagem before the curtains are finally drawn on his lacklustre four-year tenure, has forgotten one important fact: that he remains the governor of Edo State, even if for a few more months and that from that point of view, the suspension of the governance and leadership of any state is inexcusable and unacceptable, not even for electoral purpose. “Matters of governance in Edo State, which was the primary ratiocination why the governor was elected, which in any case have been herein before handled with Olympian aloofness and magisterial pontifications, have now been completely abandoned, jettisoned and forgotten, as the governor has turned his attention, full time, on how to subvert the September 19 election through rigging, intimidation, arm-twisting, unbridled threats, violence and other anti-democratic underhand tactics. “What we are now regaled with from the Government House, Benin, which in the meantime houses Obaseki, are reports of conflicts over the illegal sharing of Edo State’s resources, turbo charged comments encouraging the youth to embrace violence and mass resignations, which have bespattered the government and reduced governance to a makossa dance and an alawada cabaret show. “While Obaseki continues to huff and puff, promote and nudge Edo youths onto the path of violence with a contrived megalomania meant to hide his crippling fear of what awaits him at the polls on September 19, governance in Edo State has been abandoned and the citizens are bearing the brunt of this governance nosedive and abandonment.” APC said the tragedy and failure of leadership playing out in Edo were coming at a time the state and indeed the globe were experiencing the greatest challenge in a lifetime.
