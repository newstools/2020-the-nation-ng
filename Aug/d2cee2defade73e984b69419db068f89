Over 500 widows, less privileged and vulnerable persons in Ekwulobia, Aguata Local Government Area of Anambra State have benefitted from the N5million palliatives from their kinsmen living in the United States of America and Canada. The gesture meant to cushion the effect of Coronavirus pandemic in the community was distributed to the various groups, with each person getting the sum of N10, 000.00. Speaking to newsmen on Saturday, President of the group, Dr. Okwudili Ezeike said the kinsmen decided to pool resources together to assauge the pains of the less privileged ocassioned by the lockdown. He said, “The people of Ekwulobia in the United States of America and Canada were deeply concerned about the effect of the COVID 19 pandemic on their people back home in Nigeria. We are aware of the effect of the pandemic on global economy and do not go with the happy belief that our people back home are having the best of times. “We employed the services of the heads of all the nine wards in order to effectively reach those in dire need of the palliatives.” Responding, Secretary of Umuchiana Peoples Congress, Mr. Wilson Ezeilo described the gesture as unique, saying it was the first of its kind in the area. “They gave us a number of people that would benefit from this programme and each kindred scrutinized its list before we came out with the poorest of the poor among us. “For the first time also the exercise was carried out with minimal friction as everybody was happy and worked collaboratively to have it succeed.” Also speaking, chairman of Abaogwume Village, Dr. Ken Akpado commended the group for its philanthropic disposition, urging other organizations to emulate the gesture.
