For the first time since 1998, the Champions League final will feature two teams who entered the competition as domestic champions, a throwback to the days of the old European Cup when only a country’s title winners were allowed to enter. Neymar’s scintillating displays of skill and ambidexterity have already lit up the Estadio da Luz, but on Sunday he stands potentially 90 minutes away from completing his mission. The 28-year-old scored in the 2015 final for Barcelona and could become only the third player to score in the final for two different teams, along with Cristiano Ronaldo and Mario Mandzukic. In 19 Champions League appearances for PSG, Neymar has been directly involved in 23 goals, scoring 14 times and assisting nine. Neymar traded the Nou Camp for the Parc des Princes having been instrumental in consigning PSG to La Remontada in 2017, when the world-record £198m transfer was widely condensed to an arrangement that suited both parties. PSG would have the superstar to bridge the gap to the elite competing for Champions League honours, while the player was amenable to being removed from Lionel Messi’s shadow and sold the vision of being better placed to win the Ballon d’Or, an obsession among Brazil’s golden boys. With Kylian Mbappe subsequently making his move from Monaco permanent the follow summer for £163m, this is a side that was bought at an exorbitant cost in order to reign across Europe. While Barcelona flounder at the offset of a complex rebuild, the Parisians are peaking at the opportune moment on the biggest of stages.
