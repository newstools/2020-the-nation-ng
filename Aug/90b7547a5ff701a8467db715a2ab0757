NURSING Parents now have an entertaining TV channel on StarTimes to support their infants’ early-learning and development. BabyTV is a cradlesong and cartoon channel that was created with the help of child development experts. The channel solves the needs of nursing parents who spend much on data streaming baby cartoon to keep their toddlers busy. BabyTV, which launched early this year on the affordable pay-TV platform StarTimes, is the world’s most widely distributed TV network created specifically for toddlers. BabyTV has fun and creative programs with inspiring characters that toddlers can relate with, helping toddlers to learn about the world while having fun. Each hour of short-form content on BabyTV is an enriching journey full of stories, lullabies, songs, rhymes, loveable characters, and fun for the whole family. Some of the content on the channel is Tutti Frutti, a musical series paying homage to Laurel and Hardy’s street performances. Also, it features Rocco, the squirrel that lives in the forest and faces new challenges in every episode. Young viewers can identify with Rocco’s challenges and experience his success. According to Lazarus Ibeabuchi, Public Relations Manager of StarTimes, “Parenting could be tasking sometimes. Keeping restless toddlers happy all the time is especially challenging. Also, busy parents are juggling everything from domestic works and homeschooling to tending to older kids. Baby TV brings succour with its engaging cradlesongs and baby cartoon content to keep toddlers happy. StarTimes is a family-oriented operator, we make sure that each member of the family can fully enjoy digital TV.”
