Katsina Governor Aminu Masari has exonerated President Muhammadu Buhari from any blame over the incessant bandit attacks in his home state and North West. According to Masari, Buhari has done all it takes to ensure security in the region, lamenting the military is yet to transform them into reality. Masari, who was speaking at presentation of a N10 million economic empowerment cheque to 1,000 women and N7 million scholarship support to 701 students in the Rimi Local Government Area by a philanthropist, Alhaji Salisu Mamman Kadandani, said he couldn’t understand why the military has not done more to help the region since most of their Service Chiefs were Northerners. He noted the bandits are camouflaging and living within the people, stating proper citizen education will help to redress the situation. He said: “We know them and their parents. To identify a bandit in rural communities is not a difficult task because you know his business, his farmland capacity and his livestock. “And if one day he buys a new motorcycle amounting to over N200, 000 then you must know that he is selling people’s lives.” Masari also performed foundation laying ceremony for a 350- capacity Assembly Hall at Kadandani community Day secondary school in Rimi local government. Addressing residents of Kadandani, the Governor spoke on the needs for private sector participation in efforts to restore the lost glory of the education in the state. He commended the contributions of Kadandani to the educational pursuits of those in domain which he said, could not be quantified. He restated the need for wealthy people and corporate organisations to contribute their quota to revamping education in the state. Kadandani, who is chairman of Continental Foundation, explained the empowerment was meant to increase access to wealth by the rural womenfolk in Rimi local government.
