Oyo State Government said on Thursday that efforts are on to ensure that maternity leave for expectant and nursing mothers is extended from four to six months.  It added that men would soon begin to enjoy paternity leave. The Commissioner for Women Affairs and Social Inclusion, Alhaja Faosat Sanni, speaking at a two-day workshop on ‘Safe Motherhood’, organised by Nigeria Association of Women Journalists (NAWOJ), Oyo State chapter, in Ibadan, said the extension was necessary so that adequate care would be given to the newborn. She noted that mothers also have the privilege to take care of themselves, as the current administration under Governor Seyi Makinde supported every key aspect of motherhood, to promote the well-being of women and children. Sanni said the administration had been promoting, educating, empowering, protecting children and women from all forms of abuse, while also supporting them financially, especially those in need of financial help. The Chairman, House Committee on Women Affairs and Community Development, Wumi Oladeji, speaking about the House of Assembly’s contribution to Safe Motherhood, said the Assembly was gender-friendly and enacted laws to take care of the interest of women and children. She added that the Assembly was the first to domesticate the Child Rights Law (2006) in the country.
