Former Barcelona attacker Emmanuel Amuneke has called for total haul at the Nou Camp following Friday’s 8-2 crushing Champions League quarter final defeat to Bayern Munich at the Stadio Da Luz in Lisbon. Amuneke, who played for the Blaugrana between 1997 and 2000, said he watched his team’s agonising defeat to the Bavarians in amazement but noted that Bayern deserved winners because they have remained consistent throughout the season. The former Golden Eaglets coach pointed out that it was time for the Barca management to make holistic changes to the team including the playing staff whose average ages stood at 29 years on Friday night in Portugal. “I am tired I don’t understand this our team performance today (Friday) ,” Amuneke said. “Well, it is football and I think we need new innovation into the team. It is not easy at all. The Bayern Munich are very much organised and they have clear idea of what they are doing. “You will see that Barcelona team were not comfortable anytime they were on the ball. I think it is end of an era for Barcelona and they need to know how to bring in young players. “If you look at the ages of those players from the defensive like to the offensive line they are quite old and need freshen up with young players. Bayern deserve the results they got.”
