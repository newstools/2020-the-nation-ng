The ‘Onome Aganga’ star made this known during the unveiling of her new hairline tagged Faithia Hair. “I have been doing other business, I also sell other beauty products before the launching of faithia hair. I started the business as a result of wanting to look good, another secret is the love for herbal products which is all-natural; I have been using them over the years,” Williams quipped.
