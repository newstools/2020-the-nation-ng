The first deputy Head of House, Prince, has said he doesn’t plan to have sex throughout his stay in the House. He told Tolanibaj this during a discussion on Tuesday, August 18. “I honestly enjoy the kissing, the cuddle, and all of that but I’m being careful because I don’t want it to get to a point where we can’t control our emotions anymore and then we end up having sex. “I’m glad to hear that you feel the same way. One thing I know for sure is that before I came into this House I said that I will never have sex under any circumstances,” Prince stated. Tolani Baj also shared the same view, saying she doesn’t plan to have sex on TV following warnings from her friend. “Not on TV please,” she replied. “My friends already warned me. I’m not that crazy because I’m American I will do shit like that”.
