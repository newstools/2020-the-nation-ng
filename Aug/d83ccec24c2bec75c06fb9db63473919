The governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr. Eyitayo Jegede, has slammed the administration of Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, saying it lacked human face. Jegede spoke while addressing Ondo State artisan groups, who were in his office to support his governorship ambition. He accused Akeredolu of misplacing priorities in terms of project execution. The PDP candidate said that “the N6.5 billion wasted on less than 100metre overhead bridge can be expended on education, which is our pride. But the government will prefer to cut corners through such phony projects. We will change the narratives.” Jegede said Akeredolu failed to maintain the high educational standard for which the state was reputed. He told his visitors not to be afraid and warned the APC not to throw the state into crisis for selfish reasons.
