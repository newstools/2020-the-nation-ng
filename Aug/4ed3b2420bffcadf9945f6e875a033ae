A group, Building Collapse Prevention Guild (BCPG), has called the attention of the Lagos State government to what it calls “a possible ticking time bomb, that could detonate in the near future, and affect the lives and properties in Osborne Estate II, Ikoyi, Lagos”. In a statement, the Coordinator and Secretary of the Ikoyi/Obalende Chapter, Messrs Tomi Ogundare, and Bola Arilesere, said their tour of the highbrow estate to see some ongoing developments revealed an accident waiting to happen. The statement reads in part: “The association even further confirmed that the developer got all his developments in the estate sealed, only to have them all unsealed by the same Commissioner of Physical Planning and Urban Development, Dr Idris Salako, who came to seal them, all within three days and this is curious. We highlighted key areas of concern to the residents association to which it has become imperative to draw the attention of the public, government and professionals to the actions of the developer. We believe that nobody is above the law.” But Assistant Director, Public Affairs, Ministry of Physical Planning and Urban Development, Mukaila Sanusi, refuted the allegation that the commissioner unsealed some sites without approval. He said: “The truth is that having dialogued with the resident association; they should come clean and say their real motives because the Ministry has tried as much as possible to carry them along in performing its statutory responsibility.”
