The governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, has said the era when monarchs were seen and treated as ceremonial community leaders was over. He said if elected, his administration would from November 12 have plans for greater roles for traditional rulers’ involvement in governance. Ize-Iyamu spoke at Igarra, the headquarters of Akoko-Edo Local Government, while addressing Akoko-Edo monarchs, who gathered to receive him and his deputy, Mallam Gani Audu. He presented the royal fathers with his SIMPLE agenda manifesto, which he called “my covenant with Edo People”, pledging his commitment to the development of the state. The governorship candidate said: “In this document (the SIMPLE agenda), we also recognise the pre-eminence of traditional rulers. It is not enough to give them ceremonial attention. Monarchs must be part of the running of government. Another key area is security. “I am able to show this document to your highnesses, because the Bible says where there is no vision, the people perish. In the last four years in Edo, we have had a government without a clear-cut agenda.” The Otaru of Igarra, Oba Emmanuel Adeche, Saiki II, urged the people to embrace peace, in order to ensure progress, development and security. He said the era of political thuggery, bitterness and violence was over. The monarch sought a peaceful, free, fair and credible election.
