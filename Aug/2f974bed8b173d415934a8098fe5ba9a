Internet celebrity Ismaila Mustapha, aka Mompha, on Tuesday demanded N5 million from the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for “unlawful re-arrest and detention.” Mompha, on trial at the Federal High Court in Lagos for allegedly laundering N33billion, was re-arrested last Friday by the EFCC. The anti-graft agency explained that although Mompha was granted N100million bail last November, he was wanted in connection with fresh cyber fraud allegations. But in the suit Mompha is claiming that EFCC acted “without any plausible reason or explanation”, during his visit to the commission’s Ikoyi office to retrieve several items seized from him last October 19.
