The Madrid Open has been cancelled due to a spike in coronavirus cases in Spain. The clay-court event was originally due to be played in May but was moved to September after the first wave of Covid-19 hit Europe, but a rise in cases in Spain has seen the tournament canned until next year. It was due to be played as the premier warm-up event for the rescheduled French Open which is set to be played at the end of September and plans had been put in place for a bio-secure bubble to be created. A statement from the tournament read: “As an act of responsibility in view of the current situation caused by Covid-19, and having thoroughly evaluated the circumstances that the pandemic continues to generate, together with the competent authorities, it has been decided that 2020 Mutua Madrid Open will not take place this year having previously been moved to 12-20 September.” The women’s WTA Tour resumed this week with the Palermo Open, with one unidentified player pulling out on the eve of the tournament after testing positive for coronavirus, while the men’s ATP Tour will start for the first time since March on August 22. That tournament, the Western & Southern Open, will serve as a warm-up event for the US Open, which will be played on the same site a week later, though several top players including Rafael Nadal have already pulled out due to safety concerns. Both tours will now work on a revamped schedule for the autumn.
