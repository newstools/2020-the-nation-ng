The Joint Health Sector Union (JOHESU) at the weekend issued a 15-day ultimatum to the Federal Government to accede to its request or risk another nationwide strike in the health sector. The union said the ultimatum began at midnight on Sunday and will expire on September 13, 2020. JOHESU National Chairman Biobelemoye Josiah spoke in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital, at the 27th National Executive Council (NEC) meeting of the National Pharmaceutical Technologists and Pharmacy Technicians of Nigeria (NAPTPTON). Josiah, who doubles as President of Medical and Health Workers Union of Nigeria (MHWUN), said the Federal Government had exhausted the union’s endurance level. He said the government requested that the union should forward the list of those that had been short-paid. Josiah listed the union’s grievances to include non-implementation of the September 20, 2017 agreement on COHESS adjustment; some court judgments in favour of the union; N5,000 hazard allowance on COVID-19, among others. “As it stands today, they paid the hazard allowance of June 2020 without correcting the errors,” he said. Labour and Employment Minister Chris Ngige has said the Federal Government will meet with the leadership of the unions to resolve some of the issues it raised.
