 THE Otu of Igarra, High Chief Joseph Mayaki Akpeji, on Thursday donated N1million to the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, and his running mate, Mallam Gani Audu. He made the donation on behalf of the Eziobe Traditional Council, Akoko Edo, when the APC candidate visited his palace. Ize-Iyamu and Audu were accompanied by former APC National Chairman Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, the lawmaker representing Edo North Senatorial District, Senator Francis Alimikhena, and the member representing Akoko-Edo Constituency in the House of Representatives and Deputy Majority Leader, Comrade Peter Akpatason. Akpeji, the head of the Eziobe Traditional Council, said the donation was an expression of his support for the APC and Ize-Iyamu’s SIMPLE agenda. He hailed the standard-bearer for his promise to tackle insecurity and partner monarchs. Accompanied by the Oshemi of Igarra, Oshimdase of Igarra and the Oshidu of Igarra, Akpeji prayed for the candidate and his running mate after endorsing them. Ize-Iyamu and Audu, who thanked the traditional ruler for his donation and blessings, were decorated with the traditional Igarra “Itowoji” clothes to symbolise their acceptance and adoption as the preferred candidate in the election. The APC candidate was also at the palace of the Otaru of Igarra, Oba Emmanuel Adeche Saiki II, where he assured the traditional rulers of his plans to maintain collaboration and partnership with them in the development of their domains, if elected as the next governor. Ize-Iyamu said monarchs and other community heads hold important roles in the state as one of the closest form of leadership to the people and the custodian of their cultural values. He promised to end the era of them being treated as mere ceremonial office holders, saying they would be involved in the governance of the state.
