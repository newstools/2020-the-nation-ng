 KUBRAT Pulev has reignited the war of words with Anthony Joshua ahead of their heavyweight title showdown in December by claiming the ‘arrogant’ Brit is ‘scared’ to fight outside of London. The Bulgarian is desperate to dethrone the unified world champion who he claims is struggling psychologically since he was handed his first defeat by Andy Ruiz last year. Pulev has insisted that he has no problem with where he fights Joshua and is confident of handing him a second knockout defeat of his career, once they finally go toe-to-toe inside the squared-circle. In an interview via the Betway Insider blog, Pulev said: “We have one heavyweight champion [Joshua] and he is too slow all the time to agree a date. We understand the world pandemic and everything but I think we can fight this year and I prepare to do this – it does not matter where, which day, I’m ready, we are training and I wait for the date. “December 5th is what we’ve heard and I hear London is favourite to host. We think London because maybe he is scared and he wants to fight there.
