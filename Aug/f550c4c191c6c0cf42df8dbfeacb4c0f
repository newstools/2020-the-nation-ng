Former Head of State, General AbdulsalamÂ Abubakar, has returned back to Minna from a medical trip to London. Abdulsalam had travelled to London in June for medical treatment. The aircraft conveying the former Head of State and 12 others, a Nigeria Airforce plane with registration No. 5Nfgv, landed at the Minna International Airport at about 9am. There was tight security at the airport as no one was allowed into the airport apart from a few family members. Among those on the aircraft with him were his wife, Hajiya Fati Lami Abubakar, his daughter and wife of the Niger State Governor, Dr. Amina Sani Bello and other family members. After disembarking from the aircraft, the elder statesman exchanged greetings and pleasantries with his family members evidently in high spirits. He was then driven straight from the airport to his Uphill Mansion.
