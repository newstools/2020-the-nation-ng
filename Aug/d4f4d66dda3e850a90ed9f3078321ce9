The University of Port Harcourt (UNIPORT) has disowned the four students arrested by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for alleged internet fraud saying the institution was not in the business of breeding criminals. Operatives of the EFCC, Port Harcourt Zonal Office, on Thursday said it arrested four students of the university following allegations of their involvement in internet fraud. The Public Relations Officer (PRO) of UNIPORT, Sam Kpenu, in a statement on Saturday said the four persons in the custody of the EFCC were not students of the institution. Kpenu said: “The persons arrested are not students of the University of Port Harcourt. The University has gone through its record and no such names are found in the record book of the University of Port Harcourt. “The University of Port Harcourt is not a breeding ground for criminals but a towering citadel of learning that turns out polished products who are making waves all around the globe. “The university frowns at the attempt to paint it in bad light through reckless reports. The university dissociates itself from this false report and calls on the general public to disregard this report which is aimed at smearing the good image of the University.”
