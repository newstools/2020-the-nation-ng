Presently innovation is the driver of growth at GBfoods and the customer sits firmly at the centre of any strategy. Listening to customer feedback lets GBfoods know what the customers need, their tastes, their food preferences, and their ways of cooking. By listening to the consumer, GBfoods has learned over the years that they want products that allow them to cook meals that retain that homemade taste, products that make it easy to work in the kitchen, and products that save time and allow them to enjoy cooking every day. Currently, GBfoods has more than 30 local brands operating in over 50 countries including Nigeria, Ghana, Spain, Italy, Germany, Finland, France, Algeria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Russia, Senegal, and Sweden. GBfoods’ solid identity even in Nigeria is evident in its local partnerships. A recent example of this is how support from the Kebbi State government, the Central Bank of Nigeria, and the Emir of Yauri was instrumental in the completion of the first fully backward integrated tomato plant in West Africa– built in Kebbi State, Nigeria. The construction of the factory has seen over 1,000 new jobs created and has set Nigeria up to be a major player in the $190 billion global tomato market. Around the world, GBfoods operates 14 factories, three of which are in Nigeria, has over 3,000 employees and currently does over €1.2 billion in sales.
