Membership of the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) in Ondo State has increased following defection of chieftains of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC) to the party. Among the defectors were a former chief of staff to ex-governor Olusegun Mimiko, Dr. Kola Ademujimi and Chief Bepie Akintade. They defected to the ZLP at Idanre Local Government. Ademujimi said they left the PDP over the primary election that brought in Eyitayo Jegede.
