Out of the 1,822, 346 registered voters in Ondo State, only 1,478,460 voters are expected to participate in the October 10, governorship election. This is because 372,888 Permanent Votersâ€™ Cards were yet to be collected. Ondo State Resident Electoral Commissioner, Dr. Rufus Akeju, who stated this in Akure, said the owners of the PVCs refused to collect despite several appeals and awareness for them to collect them. Dr. Akeju said only those with PVCs would be allowed to vote. He said all COVID-19 protocols would be followed during the conduct of the elections.
