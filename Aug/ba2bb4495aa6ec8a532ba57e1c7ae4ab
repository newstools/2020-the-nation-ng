He said primary and secondary schools would re-open anytime from September 21, 2020. He however said the decision was subject to a review of ongoing modelling of response to the pandemic. Restaurants, Sanwo-Olu said, are permitted to open for in-dining services and they must ensure maintenance of 50% maximum occupancy at any point in time. “They must also have obtained a Provisional Safety Compliance Certificate through the registration portal of the Lagos State Safety Commission: www.lasgsafetyreg.com. “Social Clubs and recreational centres that have Registered Trustees have also been permitted to open on the condition that they have applied for and obtained a Provisional Safety Compliance Certificate through the registration portal of the Lagos State Safety Commission: www.lasgsafetyreg.com.” He said the government is sympathetic to the plight of business owners, particularly those in the hospitality and tourism sectors but reviewing the permissible opening dates and will advise on this in September. “For the avoidance of doubt, all event centres, bars, lounges, night clubs, spas, beaches, cinemas, gyms and game arcades remain closed for now,” he added. The Governor was pleased with the easing of the lockdown but warned “the fact that we have been seeing a gradual easing of the lockdown does not mean that we are now returning to our old way of doing things. “The easing you are seeing is the outcome of a careful and deliberate attempt to ensure that livelihoods are not crippled by the overwhelmingly disruptive impact of the virus. It is certainly not an invitation to carelessness or nonchalance.”
