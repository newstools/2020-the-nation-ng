Two Lebanese nationals held by men of the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) for alleged money laundering have been handed over to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) in Rivers State. Dina Khalil and Chamseddine Mohammed were arrested enroute Labanon when customs men at the International Airport, Omuogwa allegedly found $890,000 cash on them. Area Controller Auwal Mohammed said Khalil had on him $670,000 while $220,000 was found on Mohammed at the time of their arrest. The area controller said it was most likely that the money was being smuggled out of the country. He said, ”The two suspects were arrested because they attempted to smuggle the money out of the country without making proper declaration to the officials of Nigerian Customs Service.” Principal Detective of the EFCC, Port-Harcourt zone, Macaulay Olayinka, pledged thorough investigation of the alleged crime, adding that the suspects would be prosecuted if found culpable.
