 Dr. Ramon Shoboyede has sent a petition to the Inspector General of Police to save him and his family from land grabbers. In a petition sent to the Assistant Inspector General of Police (AIG) Force Headquarters, Zone 2, Lagos, dated April 10, 2020, captioned “A LETTER OF PETITION FOR FORCEFUL ENTRY, ILLEGAL POSSESSION OF PROPERTY AT GBADAMOSI STREET VIA ITELE, SANGO-OTA, the petitioner urged the IGP to save him from  land grabbers boasting to kill him. Dr. Shoboyede said he bought a land at Ejigun Agbede Village, Itele-Ota, Ogun State June 2011 and built a three-bedroom flat up to the window level. On visiting the site to begin work on December 11, the three- bedroom flat had been demolished and fenced round by someone. He said the Commissioner of Police, Eleweran and some elders in the community later weighed in and the family which sold the land to me allocated a new land for me at Gbadamosi Street, Ijoba Bus Stop, via Itele Road in Ado-Odo Local Government Area.  According to the petition, Shoboyede said he was on the site on March 27, 2020 with the intention to clear the bush and start the building project when he discovered the land had been sold to another fellow. He said: “Upon inquiry, I was told that a land grabber in conjunction with a family and others took the advantage of the lockdown in the country to sell the land. “This land grabber has been boasting that should I or any member of my family show up on the land, he will kill us. “I am now appealing to the inspector General of Police to use his good offices to step into the matter to avoid disturbance which can lead to the loss of lives in the community.”
