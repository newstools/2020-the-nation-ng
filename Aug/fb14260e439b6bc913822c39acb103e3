The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has uncovered a 40ft container loaded with tramadol and other banned medicines at Brawal Terminal in Lagos. This was made known in a statement by the Principal Staff Officer, Public Affairs, of the Agency, Mr Jonah Achema, in Abuja on Wednesday. According to the statement, Chairman, NDLEA, Col. Muhammad Abdallah (Rtd) said this comes after the follow up on the police arrest of another 40ft container loaded with cartons of brushes, 40 cartons of tramadol and other banned drugs. “You will recall that Police detectives in Apapa Area Command of Lagos State have intercepted a 40-foot container laden with drugs suspected to be tramadol and codeine on August 6. “The container was intercepted on water and taken to a bonded terminal in Apapa. “NDLEA’s investigation further revealed another 40 foot container. This joint examination revealed 255 cartons of different types of tramadol and other banned medicines. “The NDLEA investigation further revealed that the tramadol is manufactured in Pakistan which is a new discovery to agency because previous tramadol were manufactured in India. “This is of global interest. Drug trafficking is one of the vices fueling insecurity across the country. “Abdallah observes that this investigation is a major breakthrough for the agency revealing the new route for movement of tramadol into Nigeria which is from Pakistan via Europe (Hamburg) to Nigeria. “These tramadol were concealed behind boxes of brushes. “Abdallah remarked that he will get to the root of this investigation and he enjoins other security agencies to collaborate with NDLEA in achieving a successful investigation. “He commends the Police, NAFDAC and other agencies for their synergy on this case,” the statement read.
