Owner of the boat which crashed in Lagos in July was on Monday arraigned at an Ikeja High Court. Happiness Elebiju is facing a 10-count charge bordering on involuntary manslaughter brought against him by the state before Justice Josephine Oyefeso. Twelve persons died in the accident. Director of Public Prosecution (DPP), Mrs Olayinka Adeyemi, told the court that the defendant allegedly overloaded his boat, leading to the drowning of the 12 passengers. Adeyemi describedÂ overcrowding as an illegal activity of boat operators and urged the court to convict the defendant as charged. Elebiju pleaded not guilty to the charges, and the defence counsel asked for time to prepare their arguments. Justice Oyefeso adjourned the case until Thursday for trial, after remanding the defendant at a correctional centre.
