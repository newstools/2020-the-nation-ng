Neo and Vee have fallen out again over food. The Housemates fought over food exactly a week ago. This time, Neo got angry for Vee’s attitude towards him after he offered her Semo. Neo had offered his girlfriend Semo prepared by Bright O but Vee rejected it, saying she doesn’t eat semo but Poundo yam. Vee’s response and attitude got Neo furious and he didn’t mince words in baring his mind. Explaining to Trickytee, Neo said he would have to tell her he isn’t in for her attitude and he doesn’t mind whatever happens after. “I go just clear her this night I no mind anything wey happen after. E no even mins say tomorrow na eviction. I know the family wey I leave for house and why I dey here,” he told Trickytee.
