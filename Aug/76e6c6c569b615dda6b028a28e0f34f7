 Former Golden Eaglets captain Musa Muhammed  at the weekend  helped his Croatian side HNK Gorica claimed their second win of the season following a 2-1 away win against  Slaven Belupo. The number 2-shirted  Nigerian defender who  was in the thick of action throughout the 90 minutes duration of the match, said  the victory on Saturday yet underlined their desire to achieve positive result  at the end of the 2020/21 season.  Nemanja Glavcic put the home side into the lead barely minutes to the end of the first half   but  Serbian striker Ognjen Mudrinski saved  the blushes of HNK  with two late goals in the 86th  and 92nd  minute of the entertaining match.  “ Playing away is always a difficult match but we showed our ability by coming back strongly in the second to win our second match of the season,” the 23-year-old defender told NationSport.
