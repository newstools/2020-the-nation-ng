Kaduna Governor Nasir El-Rufai has described withdrawal of his invitation to speak at the 2020 Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) conference as an “unfortunate embrace of injustice”. El-Rufai, in a statement by his spokesperson, Muyiwa Adekeye, vowed he cannot be gagged. The NBA withdrew the invitation, following vociferous protests from some lawyers. However, El-Rufai in the statement, insisted he will continue to offer his opinions on critical issues in the country and his voice will not be silenced. “While the decision about who speaks at its event is clearly the NBA’s, Malam El-Rufai wishes to make clear that he did not seek the platform and is not agitated that he has one less speaking engagement. “However, the circumstances of the last few days warrant some comments. That a professional organisation has elected to endorse a one-sided narrative on a profound national issue is something that its members may wish to reflect upon. “For an association, whose bread and butter is about justice, to make a ruling based on the stridency of people who lampoon judicial processes against certain individuals without hearing the other side is odd. “It bears noting that in its response to pressure, the NBA leadership has signalled an unfortunate embrace of injustice, unfairness, absence of fair hearing and total disregard for the rule of law.”
