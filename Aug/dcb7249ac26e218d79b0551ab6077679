Bayelsa State governor,  Douye Diri,  has stressed the need for Bayelsa people, regardless of party differences, to put the interest of the state ahead of other considerations. Diri stated this when he received members of the Bayelsa caucus of the House of Representatives in his office, a statement by his Acting Chief Press Secretary, Daniel Alabra, said on Friday. He said the task of moving the state forward required all hands on deck, expressing appreciation to members of the caucus for putting party differences aside for the sake of development of the state. He emphasised the need for Bayelsans to promote love and reconciliation while creating sustainable opportunities for youths and women rather than using them as tools for electoral violence. Diri reaffirmed the determination of his administration to fulfill his campaign promises and expressed optimism that with the support of the Reps caucus, Bayelsa would be the envy of other states. He said: “I appreciate you for deciding to work together not minding party differences and believing that the interest of the state is paramount. “We are happy with what we have seen. Let us preach love, let us preach reconciliation. This is your government. We are not here to serve only the Peoples Democratic Party. This is your government of prosperity, and we mean every word we put out.” In his remarks, Chairman of the caucus, Chief Fred Agbedi, who represents Sagbama/Ekeremor Federal Constituency, said the visit was to express their readiness to work with the government in order to move the state forward. He congratulated the governor on his emergence and lauded him for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the security challenges of the state. Agbedi stated that the caucus members were ready to work with the governor to attract development to the state.
