 THE Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Lagos Command has called on airlines to assist passengers to administer information cards onboard the aircraft to reduce delays on arrival at airports. Its Comptroller, Abdullahi Usman, stated this when members of the Association of Foreign Airlines and Representatives in Nigeria (AFARN) visited him. Usman said it was the responsibility of the airlines, apart from distribution of information cards, to also ensure that the cards were filled appropriately by passengers to avoid delays at the Immigration counters. He emphasised that if the documents or cards did not have the required information the NIS needed, it could result in officers asking certain questions to update the cards and this may lead to delay. Usman urged airlines to ensure proper profiling of passengers before boarding, especially those with the right visas and other relevant documents for airport facilitation. The NIS Lagos Airport boss stressed that the implementation of social distance was one of the key precautionary measures that must strictly be adhered to, adding that the implementation and control of passengers should start from the airlines for seamless passengersâ€™ clearance. He said the elderly and the nursing mothers would be given special attention.
