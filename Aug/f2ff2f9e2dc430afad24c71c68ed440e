Operatives of the Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences (Enforcement) Unit (Task Force) are set to demolish illegal structures on ‘Idera Land Scheme’ in lbeju Lekki. The owners of the structures was served a seven-day removal order by the Agency on August 19, 2020. The Agency also warned owners of illegal shanties in Apapa Tin Can Island Park to vacate within seven days as the place will be redeveloped and given a new look by government. Chairman of the task force Olayinka Egbeyemi said all illegal structures and shanties encroaching on ‘Idera Land Scheme’, Ibeju Lekki would be demolished after the expiration of the seven days ‘Removal Order’. Egbeyemi disclosed further that the Government had observed with dismay the massive encroachment by individuals, private estate developers and land speculators on lands using them to defraud innocent members of public who purchase parcels of land within government acquisition areas across the State particularly around Ibeju-Lekki corridor. He implored Lagosians who are interested in purchasing lands in the State, to first verify the Land records at the State Land Registry or Surveyor General’s Office where millions of land documents are stored in the ‘Electronic Data Management System (EDMS)’ consisting details of documented lands and properties in Lagos in order not to be swindled by land speculators. “All illegal structures and buildings constructed on State lands by person, companies or institutions without valid titles from the Government across the State would be removed”, he added. The Chairman also warned miscreants, illegal mechanics, food vendors and owners of illegal shanties within Apapa Tin Can Island Park to vacate within 7 days as the entire area is set to be redeveloped and given a new look in line with the T.H.E.M.E agenda of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to transform the State into a functional and efficient model Mega-City. He said that a situation where illegal squatters jumped on Government Acquired Land to errect illegal structures and shanties would no longer be tolerated by the government.
