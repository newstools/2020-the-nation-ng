 THE Secretary to Rivers State Government, Dr. Tammy Danagogo, has congratulated a former Governor of the state, Dr. Peter Odili on his 72nd birthday. Danagogo in a statement issued in Port Harcourt, to mark the birthday of the former governor, described Odili as a revered statesman, philanthropist, a father-figure and pillar for everybody in Rivers politics and the Governor Nyesom Wike-led administration. He noted that Odili’s contribution to the socio-political and economic development of the state over the years was worthy of commendation. He referred to the former ‘Golden Governor’ of the state as a detribalised statesman, who transformed many persons irrespective of tribe or creed. “His leadership qualities and strength of character are worthy of emulation to all. May Almighty God sustain and continue to grant you good health in the coming years as I join family, friends, colleagues and well-wishers to celebrate your birthday sir,” he said.
