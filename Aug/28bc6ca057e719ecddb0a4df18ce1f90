Nigerian striker  Odion Ighalo has been included in  Manchester United 23-man squad to take  on Copenhagen in today’s  quarter-finals of the Europa League in Cologne  as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer targets his first piece of silverware. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and his staff have taken a 23-man squad for what could be 11 days in Germany if they reach the final. The final was originally supposed to be held in Gdansk, Poland, but that has been pushed back to next year with Germany seen as an ideal country to host the new knockout format. United saw off LASK last  Wednesday to confirm their place in the competition’s last eight as Solskjaer targets his first trophy with the club.  “I am ambitious – and one of my dreams is to lift the trophy as a manager for this club,” he said. “I owe my career to this club, so winning something as manager would be the proudest moment of my football life. It would be the biggest achievement. “As a player, I was part of a fantastic team and, sometimes, you just ride a wave. Roy Keane would say his back was sore because he carried me and he is probably right! “I contributed as well as I could, I was always ready. To lift a trophy now would be the best moment of my career.” United’s squad in full: Bishop, De Gea, Grant; Dalot, Fosu-Mensah, Laird, Lindelof, Mengi, Wan-Bissaka, Williams; Fernandes, Galbraith, Garner, Pogba, Matic, Mata, Lingard, Pereira; Chong, Greenwood, Ighalo, James, Rashford.
