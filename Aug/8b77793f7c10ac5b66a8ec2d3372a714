 Laycon has argued fellow Housemates to prepare his food anytime he is hungry so he doesn’t starve. Laycon, during a conversation with Prince and Dorathy, jokingly insinuated other Housemates should always make food for him as he isn’t a good cook.  He had asked Dorathy why she didn’t make him food but she replied “I’m not your mom”. “Big Brother please send Laycon somebody to care for him, I’m not in that business,” said Dorathy. Laycon also replied “It’s in everybody’s hands to make sure that I do not starve to death.’’
