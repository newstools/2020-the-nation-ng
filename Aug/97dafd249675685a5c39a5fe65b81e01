Yet to be capped  Cyriel Dessers has reportedly  hailed Super Eagles striker and club teammate, Paul Onuachu for his immediate impact in their opening day win away at Zulte Waregem. The former Heracles Almelo striker, who started ahead of Onuachu in the clash, told AOIFootball.com afterwards that his compatriot’s impact from the bench was a big morale booster as it gave me more freedom to operate. “It was great to play with Paul; he really changed the game today (Sunday) and we helped each other and created spaces for each other. The linkup play was fantastic. Super-sub Onuachu came off the bench to grab the equalizer for Genk who was down at half time before he then forced a penalty moments later and Dessers stepped up to convert and seal a 2-1 win. Elsewhere, Nigerian  striker Sadiq Umar opened his season’s account in style as he scored twice to help FK Partizan to a comfortable 4-0 thrashing of visitors FK Javor Ivanjica in the Serbian SuperLiga. With one win and a loss in their opening two league fixtures of the campaign, the hosts were desperate to record their second win of the season, with Sadiq Umar also looking for his first league goal despite having a fantastic preseason. The wait however lasted for just 13 minutes as the former Dream Team striker made the most of a defensive lapse to net his debut goal of the season and put his side 1-0 up. Umar then doubled his side’s lead five minutes later in a similar fashion, reacting quickest to a drop ball by the goalkeeper to back-heel it into an empty net to make it 2-0. Seydouba Soumah then made it 3-0 before the half time whistle with Japanese winger Takuma Asano completing the scoring 14 minute from time to seal a comfortable 4-0 win. The win now sees Partizan moved  up to seventh position  on the log with six  points from a possible nine- three behind defending Champions Crvena Zvezda who are yet to drop a single point this campaign.
