Bright O has suggested Lucy is a fake Housemate. Bright O said this during his diary session with Biggie on Friday, August 28. Bright O insinuated that Lucy is not bothered about anything in the House, which means she is sure of her long stay in the House. “I think Lucy may be a fake Housemate in the House. I said this because of her attitude. Lucy attacks everyone and acts fearless and confident when arguing,” he said. Bright O and Lucy have continued to prepare delicious meals for the Housemates in the last six weeks.
