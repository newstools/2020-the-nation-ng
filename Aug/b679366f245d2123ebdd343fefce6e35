 THE Sheikh Ibrahim Zakzaky-led Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN) has alleged that three of their members were killed in a clash with policemen during their annual Ashura mourning procession in Kaduna on Friday evening. It was gathered that the incident took place at Hayin Bello neighbourhood close to Rigasa in Igabi Local Government Area of Kaduna State. IMN spokesman Malam Ibrahim Musa, in a statement, alleged that the policemen were sent by Governor Nasir El-Rufa’i. The statement reads: “On Saturday evening, at Hayin Bello neighbourhood, a team of policemen attacked a gathering of members of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria holding the annual Ashura mourning commemorating the brutal assassination of Imam Husein, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and killed three persons instantly. “Those killed are: Abubakar Talle, Ali Rigasa and Hassan Umar Aliyu, with many people injured by gunshots. The police also vandalised the vehicles of those who attended the mourning session. “A police vehicle caught fire when it fell into a gutter as they tried to hurriedly run away after the shooting spree. That resulted in the burning of a nearby house.” But, when contacted, the Kaduna State Police Command’s spokesman, ASP Muhammad Jalige, said he would get back to our correspondent with the police response.
