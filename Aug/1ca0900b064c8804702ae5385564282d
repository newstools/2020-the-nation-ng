 Widow of former Oyo Governor Abiola Ajimobi Dr Florence Ajimobi has described death as a ‘necessary evil’ that no one has power or control over when it’s due. She enjoined all to be mindful of their actions and efforts while alive, saying everything about life is vanity in itself. She spoke over the weekend while playing host to journalists who visited the Ajimobi’s Oluyole, Ibadan residence on a condolence visit. Noting she had learnt very serious lessons from the death of her husband, the Access to Basic Care (ABC) founder said: “We are celebrating a man who impacted the lives of everyone he came in contact with. Your being here today, it says a lot. “Human beings are the most difficult to please in life but when people who have worked with you come back to visit or pay a condolence visit it shows that you put that smile on my face. “Today has not been a very good day for me, it has been a very turbulent day and emotional but thank you for putting smile on my face with your visit.  “Yes daddy has gone but for me it’s not his going we are celebrating. As a man, he came, he saw and he conquered and I know he’s resting at the bosom of God that is my joy and that is what is giving me peace, he made heavens and that is how we must relate when we are in the world.” She added: “It will come whether you are sleeping, eating, drinking, it has to take something with it. “I am ever so proud to be called his wife and all the people, the larger family that we belong to, let us take lessons and know that life is vanity upon vanity. “Who knew in December, that in exactly six months and nine days anybody had told him that, that would be his last birthday, he would probably say jump in the lake. “We should just live everyday as if it’s our last and have a very good relationship with God, our ultimate goal on earth is to make heaven, whether as a Muslim or a Christian, whatever way we pray to God or serve.”
