Ondo APC Chairman Ade Adetimehin, who received the defectors, said Ondo might soon become a one party state following the number of prominent politicians defecting from other parties to the APC. He said the recent defection of bigwigs of other parties to the APC was a measure of the development occurring in every nook and cranny of the state.
