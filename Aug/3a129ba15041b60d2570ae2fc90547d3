 THE contractors association of Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) has pleaded with President Muhammadu Buhari to prevail on the National Assembly to quickly pass the 2020 budget of the intervention agency. It also enjoined the President to ask the National Assembly to remove its  lien  on NDDC funds  to enable the commission meet up with its financial obligations, including  payment of monies owed its members. The association added  in a statement on Sunday  by its President,  Ebuka Nwanyiri, that Buhari should not sack the IMC because of its gargantuan achievements and desire to ensure the completion of the forensic audit. Expressing its  total support for the  audit, it said those  against the Prof. Kemebradikumo Pondei-led IMC were scared of being indicted The statement reads:  ”The association has observed with keen interest the grand efforts of the IMC to right the wrongs in NDDC. The IMC has brought the new headquarters at marine base to a near completion level. “Previous NDDC managements since 2000 were not able to rescue the commission from multi-million naira annual rent payments at its Aba Road headquarters  in Port Harcourt.. This bold step to move  the NDDC to its permanent site by the IMC is a gargantuan achievement that is highly commendable.” ”The President should not dissolve the IMC because certain stakeholders in the Niger Delta want them out by all means, including the use of media and blackmail. “That the IMC has given firm assurance to contractors association of NDDC that once funds are released to it, massive payments shall be done for all contracts that are well executed and that have credible payment certificates. “ To this end, we urge President Buhari to prevail on the National Assembly to pass NDDC budget and also to remove the lien they placed on NDDC funds with which is preventing NDDC from paying her contractors.”
