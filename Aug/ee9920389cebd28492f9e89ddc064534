 BAYERN Munich last night beat Olympique Lyon 3-0 to book a place in the final of the 2020 UEFA Champions League billed for Sunday in Portugal. Serge Gnabry scored a first-half double while Robert Lewandowski scored the other goal with a late second half strike for what was his ninth successive goal of the UCL. Though the French underdogs hit the post twice in the opening minutes, the Germans soon took control over the match and were rewarded for their attacking efforts. The 23-year-old Gnabry is the second player to net a brace in a Champions League semi-final, following current teammate Thomas Müller back in the 2012/13 season against Barcelona. The former Arsenal player struck the first goal in the 18th minute and in the 33rd minute while Lewandowski struck in the 88th minute for his 55th goal of the season. Victory secures Bayern Munich a place in Sunday’s final against PSG who beat RB Leipzig with an identical 3-0 in Tuesday final
