 Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has promised to construct two new hostels that would accommodate 900 students each at the Nigerian Law School, Yenagoa, Bayelsa State. The governor said his administration would also build a 1,500-capacity Multi-Purpose Hall at the school. A statement signed by the Commissioner for Information and Communications, Paulinus Nsirim, stated that Wike made the promise when he visited the school in company of Director-General of the Nigerian Law School, Prof. Isa Hayatu Chiroma, on Thursday. He said the gesture was part of the state government’s contribution to the development of legal education in the country. He said: “Rivers State also belongs to the South-South, so we think we should also make our own contribution. Our State will construct two new hostels to accommodate nine hundred students each and also build a multipurpose hall that will accommodate 1,500 students. “Ordinarily, this school was supposed to be located in Port Harcourt, but the former administration rejected the offer made to them. You know also that Bayelsa State was created out of Rivers State. Hence, we are still the same and whatever I can do in Rivers State, I can also do in Bayelsa State.” Wike said, despite the economic challenges faced by the state, it would source funds from its scarce resources to execute the project. He noted that the present economic challenges would not stop his administration from solving problems. “This project will be executed immediately because we do not make promises without fulfilling them. I have directed the Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice to write to the Director General to forward the design, so we can commence work immediately, “he said. In his remarks, Chiroma expressed gratitude to Wike and the Rivers State Government for the support, saying the school would ever remain grateful.
