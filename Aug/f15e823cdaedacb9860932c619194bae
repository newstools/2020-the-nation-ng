White is one colour that is easy to find in a fashionista’s wardrobe and white materials are experiencing a revolution. For so many reasons, white dresses are often ignored because we do not know what  to wear and what not to wear with them. The white dress is the summery sister of the little black dress (LBD). It is versatile, matches everything and can be worn day or night. Like your favourite little black dress, a little white dress (LWD) is a great neutral foundation upon which you can build a fabulous outfit accented with bold accessories and glamorous footwear. They are no longer as formal as they used to be. They are getting bolder and more daring by the day. Every woman who loves sophistication should embrace the little white dress in her wardrobe. It is super chic and adorable on every woman-It’s the ultimate wardrobe essential.
