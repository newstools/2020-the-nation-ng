Poor countries’ debt payments have reached their highest level since 2001, having grown by 115 per cent in the past decade, a new analysis released at the weekend has shown. A group, Jubilee Debt Campaign, which launched a portal collating debt data concerning 194 countries, said 52 countries are in debt crisis, from 31 in 2018, 27 in 2017, and 22 in 2015. This means debt payments are significantly undermining their governments’ abilities to protect the basic economic and social rights of their citizens. Nigeria’s total public debt portfolio, all the states and the Federal Government inclusive, stood at N28.63 trillion as at March 31. According to the Nigerian Domestic and Foreign Debt Q1 2020 report released mid- July by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the total public debt rose by 4.48 per cent compared to the N27.40 trillion recorded in Q4 of s2019. External debt accounted for N9.99 trillion or 34.89 per cent of the total debt. The domestic component stood at N18.64 trillion or 65.11 per cent of total borrowing. Of the domestic debt of N18.64 trillion, Federal Government’s share alone is N14.53 trillion compared to Q4 2019 when total domestic debt was N18.37 trillion with the federal government accounting for N14.27 trillion. The Federal Government’s domestic debt service for Q1 also increased to N609.13 billion compared to N254.04 billion in Q4 of 2019. Total domestic debts by states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) were valued at N4.11 trillion with Lagos State accounting for N444.23 billion or 10.8 per cent while Yobe was adjusted to have the least debt domestic stock, accounting for N29.29 billion or 0.7 per cent of total debt. In dollar terms, however, Nigeria’s foreign debt was estimated at $27.66 billion. The coronavirus pandemic has hit countries with recessions, lower revenue and higher interest rates, making debt payment burdens even worse than they were, said Jubilee’s Director Sarah-Jayne Clifton. Jubilee estimates average government external debt payments will reach 14.3per cent of government revenue this year, up from 6.7per cent in 2010. “Debt burdens were already taking much-needed money away from healthcare and social protection before the COVID-19 crisis hit and the situation is rapidly deteriorating,” Clifton said. The 52 countries in debt crisis, more than half of which are in Africa and Latin America, represents an increase of 22 from when Jubilee last conducted this analysis in 2018. This jump shows that lenders and the international community need to reduce the burden of debt on these and other countries, Clifton said. “We need urgent action to cancel payments, to reduce debt to a sustainable level, and to rein in irresponsible lending to stop debt crises coming back to haunt us every decade,” she said. Jubilee analyses debt payments as a percentage of government revenue, the extent to which a whole country (both its public and private sectors) is a net creditor or debtor to the rest of the world, the size of a country’s private external debt, International Monetary Fund (IMF) debt risk ratings and each country’s current account balance (the amount it is paying to and earning from the rest of the world each year). The group said together these metrics give a more accurate picture of the debt situation than the standard measure of ‘debt as a percentage of GDP’, which does not take into account factors such as interest rates, government revenue availability or the period over which the debt is owed.
