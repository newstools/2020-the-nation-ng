 THIAGO Silva says he joined Chelsea to “challenge for honours” as Frank Lampard continued his summer spree with the capture of the former Paris Saint-Germain man. The Brazil centre-back has completed his free transfer move to Stamford Bridge just days after falling narrowly short in the Champions League Final. He has signed a one-year contract with the Blues, with the club holding the option of adding another 12 months. Silva’s addition will help manager Frank Lampard restructure his defence and follows Wednesday’s £45million capture of England left-back Ben Chilwell from Leicester. The 35-year-old said: “I am so happy to be joining Chelsea. I am delighted to be a part of Frank Lampard’s exciting squad for next season and I’m here to challenge for honours. See you soon Chelsea fans, I look forward to playing at Stamford Bridge very soon.” Silva’s eight years in France ended with PSG’s 1-0 defeat by Bayern Munich on Sunday, and the Blues have since moved quickly to tie up a deal for the 89-cap Brazil international. “We are delighted to be able to add a player of Thiago Silva’s proven world-class credentials to our squad,” said Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia. “Having performed at the highest level for many years, we have no doubt his experience and quality will complement the many exciting talents we already have here.
