Nasarawa state Governor Abdullahi Sule on Thursday condemned the defilement of a three-year-old girl in the state, promising to ensure that the perpetrator is brought to book. Sule said in Lafia, the state capital, during the inauguration of the State Action Plan (SAP) on United Nations Security Council Resolution on Women, Peace and Security (UNSCR 1325). The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), reports that the baby was allegedly raped by a 27-year-old man in Adogi community of Lafia council area recently. Sule said the incident left the state in shock and every effort has been put in place to secure justice for the family of the child and ensure such incident never repeats itself and cases of rape incidents are put to an end in the state. “It is disheartening to recall the recent incident that occurred in Adogi, Lafia East in which an infant was raped, leaving the child and the parents in agony and trauma. “Let me place it on record that government will not take this lightly. Whoever [perpetrated] this dastardly act will be severely dealt with in accordance with the law. “I call on parents and the vigilante groups to ensure effective monitoring of our children in order to guard them against this kind of act which is gradually eroding the moral values of our society,” he said.
