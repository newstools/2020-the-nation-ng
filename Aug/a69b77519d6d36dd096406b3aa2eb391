 GOVERNOR Godwin Obaseki has assured the people that he will not disappoint them if re-elected, as he has laid the foundation for greater development. He spoke at the palace of Otaru of Igarra, Oba Emmanuel Saiki, where he solicited the royal father’s blessings and support for his re-election. “I’m seeking re-election because we have started a revolution of development in the last four years to make governance relevant to Edo people. “We pay civil servants and pensioners in time; we have trained our teachers to be digital and now our children are learning well. “We have improved on infrastructure in Igarra land and we will do more. “At this period of COVID-19 pandemic, the people need a leader with focus who is concerned about the lives of the people. “Agriculture must be improved on and taken seriously, as farming should be a priority because money from Abuja has been cut down.”
