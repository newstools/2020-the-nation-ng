  Major multinationals are acquiring more equity stakes to shore up their majority controlling equities in their Nigerian subsidiaries. Most analysts regarded the acquisition of additional stakes as key strategies to reinforce their control over their Nigerian businesses as a major hub for African businesses under the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). Trading reports on insider transactions at the stock market obtained at the weekend indicated that Unilever United Kingdom increased its majority shareholding in Unilever Nigeria to 75.49 per cent while Netherlands-based Heineken N.V. increased its controlling equity stake in Nigerian Breweries to 55.9543 per cent. The reports indicated that the acquisitions were consummated through direct dealings on the secondary market, taking advantage of the attractive valuation of the Nigerian companies. Unilever UK, which had earlier indicated interest in increasing its majority equity stake in Unilever Nigeria up to 75 per cent, acquired additional 1.46 per cent equity stake in the Nigerian company. The deals were consummated through its holding company, Unilever Overseas Holdings B.V. Heineken acquired about 0.0043 per cent additional equity stake through Heineken Brouwerijen BV. The reports indicated that Heineken struck several deals to acquire a total of 347,042 ordinary shares of 50 kobo each, equivalent to 0.0043 per cent additional equity stake in Nigerian Breweries. The transactions were consummated at price range of between N33.92 and N37. Unilever Overseas Holdings acquired 84.117 million ordinary shares of 50 kobo each at between N12 and N12.5 per share in a deal valued at N1.04 billion. Prior to the latest acquisitions, Unilever held 74.03 per cent majority equity stake in Unilever Nigeria while Heineken, through three subsidiaries, held 55.95 per cent majority stake. Heineken’s holdings were held by Heineken Brouwerijen B.V., 37.76 per cent; Distilled Trading International BV, 15.47 per cent and Heineken International B.V., which held 2.72 per cent. Heineken Brouwerijen BV’s holding now stands at 37.7643 per cent. The latest acquisitions are significant for the two multinationals. Every additional share increases Heineken’s control on the Nigerian subsidiary. The single largest domestic stake in the widely dispersed Nigerian Breweries’ shareholding is 0.44 per cent held by Odutola Holdings Limited. The latest acquisition placed Unilever Nigeria ahead of its five-year quest to attain 75 per cent controlling shareholding in the Nigerian company. Unilever has over a five-year period increased its shareholding in Unilever Nigeria by 25 per cent. Nigerian shareholders had in 2015 rejected a £144.5 million tender offer from Unilever, which sought to acquire shares from Nigerian minority shareholders to increase the foreign controlling equity to 75 per cent. Unilever held 50 per cent majority equity stake by 2015. Over the five-year period, Unilever combined primary and second market acquisitions to acquire its long-term strategic intent in Nigeria. Unilever had cited “long-term strategic importance of Unilever Nigeria to its global business” as the major reason for the quest for increased equity stake. Market analysts at the weekend said the foreign majority shareholders might be taking advantage of the foreign exchange (forex) lockup and the resultant devaluation of naira, which had trapped many foreign portfolio investors to undertake indirect buyouts that would, ultimately, reduce domestic institutional and individual retail shareholdings in the multinational companies. Analysts, who spoke under anonymity because of confidentiality clause, said attractive valuation of Nigerian equities and the devaluation of naira have made Nigerian stocks soft targets for foreign investors. Analysts said the new acquisitions were futuristic, citing the declining performance of the two multinationals in recent period. The AfCFTA seeks to create a single continental market for goods and services of African origin with free movements across the member countries. Nigeria has already signed the AfCFTA agreement.

Nigerian Breweries’ turnover dropped by N18 billion to N152 billion in first half of 2020 as Nigeria’s largest brewer continued to struggle with macroeconomic headwinds, which were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
