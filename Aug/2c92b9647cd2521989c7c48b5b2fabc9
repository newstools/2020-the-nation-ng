Youthrise Nigeria, a non-governmental organisation,  has urged government to develop inmate-friendly policies and programmes in the country’s correctional centres. The organisation made the call during an advocacy campaign at the Kirikiri Female Custodial Centre in Lagos to promote evidence-based awareness on the condition of reformation centres. The group donated communication materials on COVID-19 to the facility, and appealed to officials of the centre to ensure proper procedures are maintained in their interactions with inmates. The items donated included PPE, hygiene kits and other essential materials to help the facilty curb the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic among inmates.
