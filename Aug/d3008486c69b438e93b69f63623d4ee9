The immediate past Emir of Kano, Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, has advised the Federal Government to rebuild Nigeria into a production economy as the country survives the coronavirus. The former traditional ruler, who offered the advice during a chat with newsmen, after Juma’at service at the Lagos Central Mosque, said that the country’s economy was bad even before COVID-19, considering the exchange rate of naira to American dollar. He stated that it would be difficult for the country to move forward, if Nigeria remains a consumer nation. Sanusi, a renowned economist, said Nigerians should prepare for hard times ahead as the government prepares to rebuild the economy.  In his message to Muslims on the attainment of the new Islamic year known as Hijrah 1442, Sanusi urged all to follow the teachings of Prophet Muhammad (SAW) to abide by Allah’s messages in the Holy Quran. Earlier, the Chief Imam of Lagos, Sheikh Sulaimon Abu-Nola, congratulated Muslims for witnessing the first Friday in the Islamic New Year Hijrah 1442 . He enjoined them to practice good deeds as advised by Prophet Muhammad. He used the occasion to pray for the country and its leaders.
