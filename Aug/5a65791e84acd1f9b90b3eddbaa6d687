Deputy Head of House Tolanibaj has gone against Big Brotherâ€™s instruction. During a meeting, the Head of House read the new rules by Biggie, stating he and his deputy must not sleep separately but on the same bad. The rule also stressed other Housemates must not sleep elsewhere but on their beds. But Tolanibaj seemed unbothered as she was seen sleeping on her bed alone over the night. She might have to explain herself to Biggie once he returns from his secret vacation.
