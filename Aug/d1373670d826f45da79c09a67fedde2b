Former Minister of Commerce and Industry Charles Ugwu is now chairman of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Imo State. Ugwu was returned unopposed as other aspirants from Okigwe zone, where the position was zoned to, stepped down for him. He promised to maintain the tenets of the party, confident the party would reclaim power. “The party will be administered in tandem with constitutional provisions and principles of democratic tenets. We will ensure that elected political office holders, including the governor, are under the party,” he said. Former Governor Emeka Ihedioha said PDP was the only party with massive followership and acceptance. He said: “PDP will remain the party of the people. We will win the next elections again and God will be on our side.” Ihedioha noted that the people were demoralised over the exit of the party from seat of  governance. He, however, maintained that the PDP remains the only democratic party, not just in Imo, but across the country. He urged those who left the party to retrace their steps as the party’s doors remained open to them.
