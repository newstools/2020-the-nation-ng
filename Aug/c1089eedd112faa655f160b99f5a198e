  Impact Hub, a Lagos-based venture builder outfit, will on Friday launch the New Economy Booster Programme, a post Covid-19 economic recovery programme for businesses in Nigeria and Ghana. According to the organisers, the goal of the programme is to boost high potential solutions or ventures already in the market or ready to go-to-market creating a positive impact on challenges faced by key sectors in both the Nigerian and Ghanaian economies. The programme is expected to bring ventures to the next level, advance business skills, offer expert advice, as well as nourish potential investor relationships. Impact Hub CEO Patrick Eromonsele said: “The new economy booster will provide entrepreneurs with access to resources that they need to ensure their sustainability. “In addition to senior expert advisory and consulting services, personal development and technical skills training, ventures will also receive connections to potential investors, peer support from other participants and partnership building opportunities. “These resources are invaluable to start-ups who want to be a part of Nigeria’s economic recovery and scale their impact.” In the seven-month online programme, which the organisers have described as ‘tailor-made,’ successful candidates will get a range of customised content and resources to develop and grow their business and network while being guided by a team of local and global experts. Created by Impact Hub in partnership with the Lab of Tomorrow, the programme is supported by The German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ).
