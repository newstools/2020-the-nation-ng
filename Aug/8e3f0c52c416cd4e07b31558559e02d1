FINANCE ACT, 2019 An Introductory Framework Preface The Finance Act 2019 has significantly introduced extensive changes to the tax regime covering different tax laws in Nigeria. It is anticipated that these changes will have progressive impacts on investments and the ease of paying taxes, especially for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). The passage of the Act symbolises a return to a period of active supervision of the economy of the country, with the aim of stimulating and creating an enabling environment for sustainable growth. The introduction of the Act has continued to generate a lot of controversies and some uncertainties as to what its practical implications are to the day-to-day businesses, individuals and interested investors, whether foreign or domestic. The changes affect the under-listed Nigerian Tax Legislations: The economy has been managed as a mono-economy for several years depending mainly on revenue from Oil and Gas, thus, neglecting other Revenue Sources. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD’s) Revenue Statistics in Africa 2019 report, revealed that the ratio of Tax Revenue generated in Nigeria to the GDP was 5.7 per cent in 2017, which was considered as one of the lowest in Africa. The cry to diversify the economy and raise revenue to finance the National budget brought about the enactment of the Finance Act 2019 with the amendments to the above Nigerian tax legislations. Aims of the Act Highlights of key changes Conclusion The changes highlighted above shall be discussed extensively in subsequent publications.
