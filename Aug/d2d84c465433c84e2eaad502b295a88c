Ondo Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has asked security agencies to call the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its supporters to order ahead of the October 10 governorship election. Akeredolu alleged members of the All Progressives Congress and its supporters were subjected to unprovoked attacks from hoodlums loyal to the governorship candidate of the PDP, Eyitayo Jegede. The Governor said members of the APC going about their personal routines were rounded up at Odopetu in Akure by PDP thugs and bodily injuries were inflicted on them. He stated that PDP thugs removed branded caps and T-shirts bearing the name of Governor Akeredolu and APC logo worn by the supporters. Governor Akeredolu, who spoke through the spokesman of his campaign organisation, Olabode Olatunde, said the mindless and unprovoked attacks were direct affront on his peaceful resolve. According to him: “We, therefore, warn the PDP not to take the political maturity of the APC and its candidate, Governor Akeredolu for granted or be misconstrued as a sign of weakness. “We are calling on the security agents to call the PDP to order as the people of the state will no longer tolerate any act of intimidation and harassment from the drowning PDP. “While we are not known for violence, we shall continue to guide our members and supporters to eschew violence and allow the electoral process to fruition. Our confidence to return to office remains unwavering.” But the Eyitayo/Gboluga Campaign Organisation (EJCO) said Akeredolu wrongly directed his post at the peace-loving members and supporters of Jegede and the PDP. Gbenga Akinmoyo, spokesman for Jegede campaign organisation, said: “We take slight comfort in the fact that we may get some form of protection from security agents since they have been put on notice by this cry of “Wolf”. “Whilst we continue to encourage our supporters to remain calm in the face of repeated provocation, we enjoined them to remain vigilant and stay safe.”
