A former Managing Director/Editor-in-Chief of the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Mallam Wada Maida is dead. He died on Monday at 70. A close associate of the late stateman Isa Funtua, Maida was said to have slumped in his home. In 2017, President Muhammadu Buhari appointed him chairman of NAN Board. Maida, a former Press Secretary to President Buhari when he was military head of state between 1984 and 1985, was board chairman of Peoples Media Limited. He became NAN Managing Director in 1994 after a long spell as Editor-in-Chief beginning from 1985. He joined NAN as a pioneer editorial staff in 1978 and was at various times the Political Editor and London Bureau Chief. In March, President Buhari felicitated with the late Maida on his 70th birthday, celebrating his achievements in journalism and public service. The late Maida, an Executive Board member of the International Press Institute, contributed to the growth of journalism in the country.
