If you have an opportunity to engage Rivers state born Dame Maureen Piribonemi Tamuno, in an intellectual conversation, you will understand why President Buhariâ€™s administration appointed her a non-career ambassador. Her depth and wealth of knowledge stand her out. Little wonder her recent confirmation by the Senate as one of the non-career ambassadors was described as well deserved by many. Her brilliance, intelligent, as well as the intimidating educational background, is phenomenal. Often when her name crops up in public discourse, she is always acknowledged as brilliant, given her intimidating credentials; holding a degree in Management Studies from the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University (ATBU) Bauchi, Bauchi State, a Post- Graduate Diploma (PGD) In Management, Master of Business Administration (MBA) in Marketing and Ph.D. in Strategic Marketing and Consumer Behaviour. Beyond this enviable academic qualifications, Tamuno, who is currently a member of the Board of Nigeria Railway Corporation, has been recognized for her humanitarian efforts through her Lady Maureen Tamuno Foundation, a non-governmental organization for the care of widows, orphans and the down-trodden in the society. The Ex- Rivers lawmaker and philanthropist of note, is one woman whose love for humanity beggars description. She has dedicated her life and time to some humanitarian gestures. Since she founded the organisation, she has tried, as humanly possible, to put smiles on the faces of the hoi polloi across the country. As a member of the Junior Chamber International (JCI) Nigeria, Tamumo trained over 300 teenagers in various skills and set them up with starter packs via her Pearls Growth Club, an NGO for young persons between the ages of 11 and 17.
