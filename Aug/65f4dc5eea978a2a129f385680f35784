 THE Rivers State Executive Council has approved N9.5 billion for the construction of 6.5km road to link Woji-Aleto-Alesa to the Port Harcourt Refinery. A statement by the Commissioner for Information and Communications, Paulinus Nsirim, said the approval was given on Wednesday during the State Executive Council Meeting presided over by Governor Nyesom Wike. Nsirim said the project would be executed by Rafoul Nigeria Limited, adding that it was in recognition of the infrastructural blueprint of the government and its Urban Renewal Programme. He said: “This project will enhance municipality expansion as it will open the state to a vast expanse of land that can be used for industrial and estate developments in the near future. “There will be an arithmetic increase in the ground rent revenue and taxes in the area in the near future. The road will also open a corridor which will lead to the Onne Port, Indorama and the Port Harcourt Refinery, and have a far reaching strategic advantage in the short, medium and long term…”
