Saying Senator Dino Melaye is a ladies’ man may not be too wrong. He is stylish, influential and has a deep pocket. All these characteristics will always endear women to a man. Being a socialite, most BBNaija stars are friends to the top politician. Last year, he hosted some housemates of the Big Brother Naija Pepper Dem, including Jackye, Nelson, Enkay, Gedoni, Jeff, Joe, and Kim Oprah – at his Abuja home. As it is, the Kogi-born former lawmaker may have found another ‘sweetheart’ in the ongoing BBN as a contestant, Dorathy, has professed her love for him. The housemate, who is a fans’ favourite due to her eye-catching physical endowment, even filled Melaye’s name as her celebrity crush in a form in the BBN house. This would have come as an open invitation for the former senator who is presently a bachelor. He was previously married to Tokunbo Melaye but she filed for divorce. The couple were blessed with three children before the union was cut short.
