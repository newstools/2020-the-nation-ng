Its cash galore as TrickyTee, Neo, Dorathy, Tolanibaj, and Prince won N1 million in the Kuda Break Free Games. The task is divided into two exciting activities. The first part is called the Break Free skit while the second is the Break Free Game. The Housemates were divided into three different groups â€“ Team Free Bank Transfers (Lucy, Laycon, Nengi, Ozo); Team No Funny Charges (Erica, Vee, Bright O, Wathoni, Kiddwaya); Team Free ATM Card (TrickyTee, Neo, Dorathy, Tolanibaj, Prince). The three groups performed their skits and Team Free ATM Card won the Break Free skit. The second task had three members of each of the teams untying three knots in a rope described as banking challenges with one hand. After several minutes of explanation, the task took place simultaneously within 20 minutes. Again, Team Free ATM Card won the Break Free Game to nab the N1 million. To this end, each member will get N200, 000 each. Other teams, Team No Funny Charges, and Team Free Bank Transfers were also rewarded with N1 million. Each of the members of the two teams will get N111,111. All the winnings of the housemates will be posted in their individual Kuda bank accounts.
