Retirees under the Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS) can heave a sigh of relief as the Federal Government has released N14.92 billion as payment for their accrued pension rights. The Acting Director-General, Mrs. Aisha Dahir-Umar, in a statement made available to journalists in Lagos said the amount will cover four months pension arrears. She stated the monies will begin to hit different Pension Fund Administrators (PFAs) account and the PFAs will immediately commence payments into different Retirement Savings Account (RSAs) of retirees. In the next three days, the monies would have reached different retirees’ account. It doesn’t take time, she assured.
