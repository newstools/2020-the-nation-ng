The chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Scandinavia countries, Ayoola Lawal, has called on Nigerians to unite across the board to immediately demand the cancellation of any loan agreements with anti-Nigeria sovereignty clauses. Ayoola, in a statement, commended the House of Representatives for bringing the clauses to light and for being professionally detailed in its oversight functions. “It is hard to sink in and comprehend that our loan lead negotiators and others involved in the negotiation and signing of the contracts can play with the sovereignty integrity of the most populated black nation on earth, Nigeria, on a platter of gold for infrastructural loans with any country. “Nigerian youths whose future is at stake are busying commending and wailing on Big Brother Africa activities rather than voicing their minds on mortgaging of their freedom and sovereignty. “Statistics revealed that Nigeria has obtained 17 different Chinese loans to fund different categories of capital projects, and 2018 loans servicing will end in 2038.” Currently, Nigeria owes China about $3.1billion, more than 10% of the $27.6billion external debt stock. Nigeria’s debt independent revenue is presently at 96%,” he noted. While calling on President Muhammadu Buhari to look into the agreement and ensure that the contracts with China is given a telescopic look and analysis, he urged citizens to collectively stand up and speak up. He said, “We must demand the cancellation of Chinese loans as long as our sovereignty is directly or indirectly linked to them.”
