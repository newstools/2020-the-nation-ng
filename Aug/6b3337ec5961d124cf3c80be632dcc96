 Osun State Governor Adegboyega Oyetola yesterday inaugurated Osun Security Network Agency code-named Operation Amotekun Board and Amotekun Independent Complaints Board. The governor, speaking at the inauguration, said the two bodies were products of the Osun Security Network Agency and Amotekun Corps (Establishment) Law 2020. He said the 15-member Osun Security Network and Amotekun Corps Board would be chaired by Gen. Ademola Aderibigbe, while Gen. Bashir Adewinbi would serve as the Corps Commander. He noted that the two generals have been selected on the strength of their capabilities as proven military tacticians and astute administrators. The Amotekun Independent Complaints Board is a three-man team headed by Justice Moshood Adeigbe. “It is our hope that the Osun Security Network Agency and the Amotekun Corps will offer improved security of lives and property and close the gaps created by the obvious overstretching of the conventional security agencies, while the Amotekun Independent Complaints Board will act as checks and balances for the activities of the Corps personnel.” Leaders of youths in the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun State yesterday declared support for Governor Oyetola to vie for second term. They said with the achievements of the governor in the past two years, 2022 was non-negotiable.
Making the declaration at the APC secretariat at Ogo-Oluwa, on behalf of youth leaders, Prince Adegboyega Adelabu said: “We gather here today under the umbrella of the Osun APC youth leaders across the local governments to unanimously declare support for Governor Oyetola for second term in 2022.”  Gen. Aderibigbe assured the governor that they would discharge their duties with all sense of responsibility.
