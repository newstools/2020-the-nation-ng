Assurances of security came from the military on Thursday against the backdrop of claims that ISIS fighters have been spotted in the Oke-Ogun area of Oyo State. There is nothing to worry about, Coordinator, Defence Media Operations, Maj.-Gen. John Enenche told journalists at a briefing in Abuja on Thursday. Enenche said that security agencies were ahead of the evolving security challenges. Gani Adams, the Aare Ona Kakanfo-in-Council, was said to have disclosed, in a communique issued after an extraordinary meeting of the council, that suspected ISIS operatives and terrorists were now in Oke-Ogun, Oyo State, News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports. “Indeed, the intel also reveals that about 500 power-bikes and assorted ammunition belonging to the terrorists have been sighted along the abandoned Lusada route moving towards Sokoto, from Igbo-Ora in Oyo State,” he claimed. Enenche dismissed the claim as nothing but just an alarm and that Nigerian security agencies were equal to the task, and would not handle it with kid gloves. “From the report I have, it is just that one where the U.S. AFRICOM advised and cautioned us about, so I believe that is what people are magnifying. But I can tell you that we have put machinery in place together with other security agencies. “So, we should be careful, because we get such stories everyday, which may be fake, though it could be true, but we don’t overlook such things. “My response is that it is not new and if it is new, tell the public that we have every machinery in place together with other security agencies as usual to handle it with their cooperation.”
