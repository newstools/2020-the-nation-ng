Some members of the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) have threatened to leave over the choice of a running mate for the party. The members said they expected the party leadership to pick its running mate from Akoko area in Ondo North senatorial district but were shocked to hear that a former Commissioner for Works, Mr. Gboye Adegbenro, has been penciled down as Agboola Ajayi’s running mate. Ondo Deputy Governor, Agboola Ajayi, whose name was submitted as the party’s governorship candidate, hails from Ondo South senatorial district while his running mate hails from Ondo Central. On Friday, over 700 members of the ZLP led by a cousin of Ajayi, Barr. Akin Sowore, defected to the APC. A former Speaker Taofik Abdusalam; former Commissioner for Sports Hon. Yekini Olanipekun and former Commissioner for Women Affairs Mrs. Simi Odunbakun, were top contenders from Akoko area eyeing to be Ajayi’s running mate ticket. Sources said Mimiko opted for Ondo Central to pick a running mate because his former Deputy Governor, Alhaji Ali Olanusi, refused entreaties to nominate a running mate as a condition to join ZLP. The source said Mimiko met with Olanusi at his Alagbaka residence on the needs to join forces to wrestle power from the APC by mobilising Ondo North votes for the ZLP in the October 10 polls. The ZLP members said they were waiting for the party to make official announcement before they start dumping the party for the APC. “In as much ZLP is not picking it’s running mate from Akoko, then the party should forget about the votes of Akoko people. “The APC candidate is from Owo and Owo local government is in the northern senatorial district. We will mobilise for him so that he will complete the eight years of Ondo north,” some of them told The Nation.
