The Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC) is targeting 500,000 Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) daily production to meet local demand and end the importation of the product. Group Managing Director, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mele Kyari, said this while inspecting the 100-million capacity Oredo Integrated Gas Handling Facility (IGHF) in Ologbo, Edo State. Kyari said that the company had lined up some projects to facilitate the realisation of the target within two years. “About one year ago, NPDC was producing about 136,000 barrels per day. Today we are producing 260,000 barrels per day. This is a very magnificent level of growth in any upstream company and our target is to take the company to the production level of 500,000 barrels per day. This is possible within two years. We have lined up a number of projects and activities and today we have the highest number of rings running in the country,” Kyari said.
