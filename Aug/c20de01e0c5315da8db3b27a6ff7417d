 THE International Congress of the All Africa Music Awards (AFRIMA) has called  for COVID-19 palliative measures for artistes and other practitioners in the music, culture and entertainment industries in Africa. The call is coming as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the African culture and creative industries. This decision was reached during the two-hour conference/meeting of the International Congress of AFRIMA held via Zoom on August 11, at 1600 hour (GMT). It was held under the theme: “Post COVID-19 Developmental Gaps and Challenges in the African Music and Entertainment Industries: African Regions and Countries Perspective”. The entertainment industry of Africa is among the worst hit industries in the coronavirus crisis. Stage and concert performances have been suspended, thereby affecting performance artistes, the technical production and support businesses where users can access entertainment without restriction.
