Erica has opened up on her relationship with Kiddwaya. She noted that Kidd is her friend notwithstanding all they do in the House. Responding to Biggie’s questions during her diary session, Erica said the only persons who have found love in the House are Vee and Neo. She noted although she’s close to Kiddwaya, she doesn’t think she has found love with him. “I think Neo and Vee have found love. I know I’ve not found love, I’m happy with Kidd, I like Kidd a lot, he is more like my best friend. “For me, I’m not looking for love right now so I’m fine with the way things are now with me and Kidd. “I think Prince and Tolani like each other, they are not just there yet and for Ozo and Nengi, I know Ozo likes Nengi a lot but I don’t think Nengi really likes Ozo”.
