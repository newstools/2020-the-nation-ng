 THE Kano State council of Friday mosque Imams has commended a Shari’a court for sentencing 22-year-old Yahaya Sharif-Aminu to death by hanging for blasphemy against Prophet Muhammad. Chairman of the council, Muhammad Nasir Adam, according to Kano Focus, urged Governor Abdullahi Ganduje to sign the death warrant. The governor has not reacted to the ruling. Sharif-Aminu, a resident of Sharifai quarters in Kano municipal, was sued for ”insulting religious creed, contrary to Section 382 (6) of Kano State Shari’a Penal Code Law 2000.” The singer was said to have committed blasphemy against the prophet in a song he circulated that went viral via WhatsApp in March 2020. The Shari’a court, presided over by Khadi Aliyu Muhammad Kani, found him guilty  and ordered that he  be hanged until he dies. Reacting on the verdict, Adam said: “The council has confidence that Governor Abdullahi Ganduje will sign the execution of the penalty. He warned Muslims to refrain from supporting “any move capable of denting the image of the prophet of Islam (Muhammad). The Commander General of the Kano State Hisbah Board, Sheikh Harun Sani Ibn Sina, also supported the judgment. “Hisbah as an organisation charged with the responsibility of enforcing Shari’a, is in support of the court verdict because anybody who does what Aminu did deserves to be killed. That is what the law says,” he said.
