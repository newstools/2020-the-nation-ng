 The proposed training camp for Super Eagles in Austria has been ruled by the head coach of the team Gernot Rohr. Rohr and his employers Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) were awaiting the approval of the football governing body, FIFA for the two friendly games proposed for next month in Austria but the tactician confirmed yesterday that the camp would not be possible. “I wanted to start a training camp for the players but I heard it was not possible,” the former Bayern Munich defender told NationSports. “The plan was to have some training games in the beginning of September but we will see,” he added.  Rohr also took time to wish Nigerians well as the number of Covid-19 cases are reducing around the country. “I hope you are all fine in Nigeria and the pandemic is not growing,” Rohr said. Meanwhile, Bundesliga club Werder Bremen are looking to sign Nigeria defender Jamilu Collins from relegated SC Paderborn. According to reports in the German press, the Greens have made an approach to sign the 26-year-old left-back this summer. Schalke O4 and Turkish club Beskitas are also interested in Collins, who joined Paderborn as a free agent in September 2017 after leaving Croatian club HNK Rijeka. Kaduna-born Collins scored once and provided two assists in 32 league appearances for Paderborn last season.
