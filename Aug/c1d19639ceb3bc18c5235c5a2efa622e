The President of Yoruba World Congress (YWC) Professor Banji Akintoye has said the late Senator Ayo Fasanmi was the brain behind the team put together by the late Chief Obafemi Awolowo to actualize his policies as the premier of the defunct western Nigeria. Akintoye, in a statement in Ado-Ekiti on Monday, said that the team sacrificed and worked assiduously in ensuring the masses enjoyed dividends of democracy and its inherent superlative benefits through people oriented programmes. The Second republic Senator said Fasanmi’s death was as a personal loss to him and a huge loss to the people of Southwest in particular and Nigeria in general. He described the deceased as a patriotic and dedicated man who prioritized the welfare and advancement of people in the country, especially the downtrodden. He commiserated with his immediate family, people of Ekiti State, praying that God will grant the family the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss and grant the deceased eternal rest. He said, ” The late elder statesman Senator Chief Ayo Fasanmi was a dedicated national democrat, the brainiest of the brains behind the yet to be equalled people oriented Obafemi Awolowo team of Western Nigeria of the mid-1950s to mid-1960s. “This team entrenched the government of the people by the people and made life abundant for the generality of the people especially the poor masses. He was a man of great capacity and loyalty. “He championed the fight against corruption during the golden era when we both served as senators representing Ekiti division of the old Ondo state in the second Republic National Assembly of 1979 to 1983.” Akintoye said that he would be greatly missed by Ekiti and Osun states and the entire Yoruba race, “for the loss of such a rare breed and pray God to grant his gallant soul the deserved eternal repose.”
