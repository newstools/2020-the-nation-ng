One of the contestants for the chairmanship position in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ondo State, Mr. Dennis Arole-Along, has described the congress as a sham. He is contesting against the Deputy Chairman, Mr. Fatai Adams. Speaking with our reporter at the venue of the congress, Arole-Along said the venue picked for the 2,150 delegates to vote was wrong. He said the arrangement was meant to be a sham, adding that it was not free or fair. Arole-Along said the voting arrangement gave room for delegates to be guided on who to vote for. Said he: “The entire process is not transparent. You see 10 delegates voting at the same time and they are being supervised on who to vote for. “The outcome of today’s congress will make or mar the PDP. It will reflect on the October 10 governorship election.” Adams, however, described the congress as free, fair and transparent. He said voting was an open thing.
