 THE fate of Deputy Governor Agboola Ajayi in the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) will be determined at a meeting of the National Executive Council (NEC), to be held this week. It was gathered that the NEC of ZLP would look into legal issues surrounding the candidacy of Ajayi. He contested last month’s primary election of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and lost to Eyitayo Jegede. His campaign posters on the platform of the ZLP have been seen in Akure and the state secretariat of the party. ZLP Chairman Joseph Akinlaja, in a television interview, said Ajayi’s application would be discussed at the party’s NEC meeting. He said considering Ajayi as a candidate of the party would not be a problem to the party, adding that it was not unconstitutional and not against the Electoral Act. Akinlaja said: “Everything will be considered at the meeting of the National Executive Council. If we find out that it will not pose any legal obstacle, he may be considered as our candidate. Previously, when addressing members of our party, I said we were going to run to win. You could see the deluge of people coming into our party. We are sure to run to win because our leader, Olusegun Mimiko, ruled this state and you could see what he did in health and education.”
