Nigerians have been urged to rise up against the growing incidence of insecurity, political corruption and abuse of power currently being witnessed within the polity by teaming up with the emerging political movement initiated by some of the country’s eminent citizens. The movement, under the aegis of the National Consultative Front (NCF), is currently setting up grassroots structures ahead of its formal launching next year. The group said mass action has become necessary to survive the present political rip off and rape of the economy by the ruling class This call was made in an address by the leadership of the NCF led by former Speaker of Nigeria, Ghali Umar Naaba and former presidential candidate, Prof Pat Utomi while felicitating with Nigerians on the occasion of the Eid Kabir celebration The statement by the head of its publicity unit, Dr Yunusa Tanko reads in part: “All Nigerians of conscience are again being enjoined to stand up and join hands with the unwavering resolve of the NCF to make the required sacrifices towards cleansing and sanitizing Nigeria’s centres of power and in smashing and flushing our prevailing corruptive political system being sustained by a tiny clique of power mongers and political merchants marauding as the country’s leaders. “In view of the various unimaginable melodrama and macabre dance of corruption and chaos within the top echelon of the Nigerian political leadership and government, which has been exposing the cause of high-level insecurity and hunger in the country today, it has also become imperative for us as victims of the increasing misgovernance and official impunity to halt the festering rot and political coronavirus in the country’s power centre.” The group urges Nigerians to rise in unison and chase out the clique of political cartel ravaging the country’s commonwealth. It said a situation, where the president “is caged and his office is being run by some unelected clique of proxies and power traders, operating without pretence to any form of mandate from the Nigerian people, is unfathomable and unacceptable and must be massively resisted and neutralized before we, as a country are all thrown into a major disaster and turmoil”. Other leaders of the group are Prof Chidi Odinkalu, Alhaji Shettima Yerima, Chief Bolaji Ayorinde (SAN), Comrade Isa Aremu, Dr Chris Ekiyor, Comrade Shehu Sanni, Sen Grace Bent, Ezekiel Nya Etok, Inuwa Garba, ProfRemi Sonaiya, Peter Ameh, Mr Segun Osinowo, Comrade Kassim Balarabe Musa and Funke Awolowo.
