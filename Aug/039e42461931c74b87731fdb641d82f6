 THE Lagos State Commissioner for Housing,  Moruf Akinderu-Fatai has said the premium estate at Sango-Tedo with 1,188 units will be delivered before the end of the year. The units are one bedroom, two-bedroom and three-bedroom flats. The estate, which was abandoned by the last administration got the approval of Governor Babajide Sanwo- Olu for completion. The commissioner said the  objective for building the estate is to bridge the housing gap in the state and afford residents the opportunity to own houses of their own. He said to qualify, a prospective buyer must be a resident of the state and show proof of tax payment.  He said: “The buyer must be a bonafide resident of the state, have evidence of tax payment and will pay five per cent of the cost of the house with the remaining spread over 10 years . It must be understood that the subscriber in a case of rent-to- own will contribute an average of 33 per cent of total earning to qualify. The state civil servants have a a dedicated 20 per cent allocation as a policy.” He cautioned Lagosians to deal with the ministry because the state does not deal with agents. On facilities available, Akinderu-Fatai said the estate is self- sustaining as it has its own water and sewage treatment plant, electricity with well maintained lawns. He said the estate is divided into two phases, with the first phase having 744 units and the second phase 444 units. He said the one-bedroom flat costs N15 million, two- bedroom flats, N18 million while a three-bedroom flat goes for N22 million. The commissioner said to maintain the estate to optimum, the government is working with a facility management firm.
