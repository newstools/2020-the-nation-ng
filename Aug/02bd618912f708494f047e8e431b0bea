KF Tirana head coach, Ndubuisi Emmanuel Egbo has reiterated his team’s readiness for their Champions League qualifying fixture against Red Star Belgrade tonight at Arena Kombetare in Tirana. Egbo became the first African coach to win a Champions League tie last week with his Albanian club after they defeated Dynamo Tbilisi 2-0 in the first qualifying round played in Tbilisi. But the former Super Eagles goalkeeper said they are going for another victory against  former European Champions Red Star Belgrade who won the  UCL Trophy in the 1990/91 season. “We will go into the game to take the maximum best from our team and by the special grace of God we will take the desired result from the game,” Egbo said in an interview. “It’s an honour to be coaching a team in the Champions league, but that is not my focus, my focus is helping my team to achieve success and set objectives of the season. “I also want to bring people to come to know and believe that there is God and he is the all in all for me,” he concluded.
