 Arsenal are considering move for Nigerian international and Club Brugge striker Emmanuel Dennis, it’s been claimed. The Gunners face a battle with fellow Premier League sides Everton and Leeds for the 22-year-old’s signature, however. Arsenal are currently in the process of trying to nail Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang down to a new contract. They’re also attempting to sort out Alexandre Lacazette’s future, with the Frenchman linked to a Juventus move.  But it seems Arsenal could be in the market for a new forward this summer. CaughtOffside are reporting that Dennis, who caught the eyes of supporters when Brugge played Real Madrid in the Champions League earlier this season, is a target of Arteta’s.  Dennis was involved in 11 goals from 33 games in all competitions last season for Brugge. The Belgian side deployed him both on the wing and in the central striker position. The 1.68metre tall forward, who is attracting the attention of top scouts in Europe as his stellar performance with his club, said he fancies playing for FC Barcelona of Spain in the nearest future.
