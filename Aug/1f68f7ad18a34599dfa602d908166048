Current Head of House Ozo has won the week three Betway Arena games in the ongoing BBNaija Lockdown. For winning the Friday night Arena game, Ozo would get the royal treatment from the remaining 17 Housemates following Biggieâ€™s instructions. Ozo, who also occupies the Head of House title for the third week, must be pampered, exempted from chores, have a full spa treatment and served food on time. Before the game, Biggie had declared that whoever wins the game would be pampered by the rest of the Housemates unhindered. Biggie also stressed that failure to give Ozo the instructed royal treatment may attract punishment. Although he was the last to take up the challenge, he completed the challenge in quicker time than the other 17 Housemates.
