Ondo Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has declared signs of his victory in the October 10 governorship election are already clear. Akeredolu said the signs were because the projects he executed were God’s projects and God would ensure victory for him and the All Progressives Congress (APC). Speaking in a live programme monitored in Akure, Akeredolu debunked insinuations his Deputy Governor, Hon Agboola Ajayi, left the APC with huge numbers of the party faithful. He said it was only Agboola the left the APC while others remained within the party. The Ondo Governor called on university professors to research into what makes Deputy Governors want to unseat sitting Governors. He stated not all deputies would be loyal like Edo Deputy Governor, Philip Shaibu, or Vice President Yemi Osibanjo. Akeredolu said his Deputy was pushed by ambition, adding that he was yet to understand why Agboola failed to find peace in the office. According to him: “The Deputy Governor is the only person that left the party. He left with no other person. The SSG that resigned is still at the party. All the aspirants that ran with me at the primaries are together with me. I know that God’s hand is in this project. “Issue of Deputy Governor happens all the time. It is not a new phenomenon. Only people guided by God’s principle can have a settled mind. Ambition will run people mad. It is primitive to look for the downfall of your principal. On the alleged violence threat by an APC chieftain, Isaacs Kekemeke, Akeredolu said Kekemeke was a man of peace and didn’t mean what he said.
