Evicted Housemate, Praise has described Bright O as the most strategic in the House. Praise, while speaking with Ebuka Uchendu in an exclusive interview, said he couldn’t figure out Bright O because of his strategy. “I kept saying it in the House, I still haven’t figured out that guy. “I think I’ve figured out every other person but Bright O is hard to pinpoint. Bright O is this today and that tomorrow. “I fear for my friend Dora because later in the game Dora started to like that boy very well and I don’t know what’s going on between Bright O and Wathoni. Bright O is interesting.” He also addressed his viral cosy moment with Ka3na. According to him: “nothing happened for sure, we cuddled, we kissed and it was very aggressive”.
