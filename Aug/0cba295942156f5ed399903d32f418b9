One person has been reported killed while many others, including final year students of a Junior Secondary School, were abducted in Kaduna. The Nation gathered that gunmen on motorcycles on Monday, about 8am, invaded Damba-Kasaya community in Chikun Local Government Area of the state, and opened fire on the villagers. They killed one person and abducted many villagers, and later invaded a school where they abducted Junior Secondary School (JSS3) pupils preparing for their final exams. A resident of the community, Wakili Bawa told journalists: “The bandits came in large numbers like they always do and were shooting rapidly. “They went to Prince Academy and abducted many of the students who were receiving lessons for their JSS3 exams. “I cannot say how many people were kidnapped, but they went away with many people. “Soldiers, who came to their rescue, turned back after some few kilometres, leaving some of the villagers who accompanied them to rescue the victims. “The villagers, not knowing that the soldiers had withdrawn, kept pursuing the bandits in the bush, the bandits fired at them and one person was killed,” Bawa said. Police spokesman Muhammad Jalige told The Nation that he would get details of the incident from the divisional police officer in charge of the area.
