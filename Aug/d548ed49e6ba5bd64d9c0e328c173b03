The village Head of Mashio, Yobe State, Alhaji Isa Mai Buba who was kidnapped by gunmen said his captors did not maltreat him, nor did they speak with him throughout the traumatic hours he spent with them in the bush. The District Head who spoke with our correspondent in Damaturu after he was rescued said he has taken his abduction as an act of Allah, stressing that he cannot remember having any quarrel with anybody to warrant an abduction. He said the kidnappers were wandering with him in the bush throughout the night until he was rescued on the morning of Tuesday. “They did not touch me nor do anything to me. The seven of them were just wandering with me in the bush. I don’t know who I have offended. This thing comes from Allah. I take it that way. They were speaking Fulani and Hausa,” he said.
