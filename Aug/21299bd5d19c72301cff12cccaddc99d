Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki on Wednesday inspected eight gunboats, marine police post and accommodation for security personnel at Gelegele in Ovia North East Local Government. He also inspected other projects executed by the government to check crime in the community. Obaseki toured the projects with Deputy Governor Philip Shaibu, members of Edo State Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Campaign Council and supporters. He said the tour was part of his re-election campaign programme. “We are here to assess the security investment we have made in Gelegele … We have built a Marine Police Post and accommodation for officers. ‘’This is a very porous waterway that leads to Ondo State and the rest of Niger Delta. It is important we secure the community against pirates and kidnappers. “In addition to the investment made for the police, we have also bought four gunboats and four ancillary patrol boats. We are working hard on improving the lives and social welfare of the people. We are rebuilding roads and other infrastructural facilities because without access roads, the cost of living will be high. “By the time we finish building the dual-carriage Ekehuan road, which will extend to the Benin River Port, the people’s living condition will change radically. My prediction is that in another three years, this community will not be recognisable.”
