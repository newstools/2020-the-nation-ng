The Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) on Thursday said that the Lagos-Ogun Mass Transit Train Services (MTTS) would resume very soon. The Lagos Railway District Manager, Mr Jerry Oche, made this disclosure in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos. “We are looking at resuming MTTS very soon. “We are putting finishing touches to the coaches and tracks. Essential staff have also been advised to resume,” Oche said. According to him, there is, however, no fixed date yet for resumption of the train service, which is well patronised by commuters. Oche said that the corporation was working round the clock to see how it could adhere strictly to COVID-19 preventive protocols and maintain social distancing in the coaches when the operations resumed. He said that coaches of the mass transit trains service were being worked upon to accommodate the possibility for social distancing. Recall that the NRC announced the suspension of the Lagos-Ogun MTTS on March 25, as a measure to contain the spread of COVID-19 in the state and the country. Though the MTTS has yet to resume, the corporation has been operating freight services from Apapa Port to Alagomeji terminals in Yaba as well as to Ijoko terminal in Ogun. Meanwhile, the corporation has said that it would commence skeletal operations on the Lagos-Ibadan Standard Guage Rail line from the middle of September, with 16 trips daily.
