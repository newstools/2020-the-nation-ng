Zamfara State House of Assembly shelved its plenary session on Thursday following the death on Wednesday evening of 16 road crash victims. The crash occurred as supporters of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in a speeding vehicle cheered the state governor Bello Muhammad Matawalle returning to the state after a visit to Abuja. The suspension of the legislative session resulted from “the tragic motor accident yesterday (Wednesday) along Gusau-Yankara Road that involved mostly supporters of our great party, Peoples Democratic party (PDP) that wanted to welcome the state governor…back to the state from an official engagement in Abuja,” a statement signed by the House Director-General, Press Affairs and Public Relations Mustapha Jafaru Kaura said. The plenary has been rescheduled for Monday, August 31. The governor has declared three days mourning.
