Bayern proved far too strong for Chelsea again as Robert Lewandowski starred in a 4-1 win at the Allianz Arena (7-1 on aggregate) to reach the Champions League quarter-final. Chelsea had a mountain to climb even before Bayern raced into a two-goal lead through Robert Lewandowski’s penalty (10) and Ivan Perisic’s simple finish (24), but the Blues clawed back some pride with Tammy Abraham’s close-range goal from Manuel Neuer’s error (44). Lewandowski, who had assisted Perisic, made the third goal for Bayern too, crossing for the unmarked sub Corentin Tolisso to finish from close range (76), and the Polish striker hit his 53rd of the season with an emphatic header (83). Bayern will now play Barcelona or Napoli in the quarter-final on Friday in Lisbon, with the winners of that game facing either Manchester City or Lyon on August 19 in the semi-final. At Camp Nou, Barcelona set up a mouth-watering Champions League quarter-final clash with Bayern Munich after beating Napoli 3-1 to progress 4-2 on aggregate. After surrendering rather meekly to Real Madrid in the La Liga title race, the Champions League is Barcelona’s only hope of a trophy this season and Clement Lenglet got them off to the perfect start by heading home a Ivan Rakitic corner. Lionel Messi then won a penalty for his side, aided by VAR which lead the referee to take a second look at the incident on the touchline monitor. Luis Suarez knocked home the penalty before Lorenzo Insigne capped off an intense first 45 minutes by scoring from the spot himself. It has been a dismal season on the domestic front for Barca, but their hopes of a sixth Champions League title remain intact. However, an imperious Bayern side will present an altogether different challenge than Gennaro Gattuso’s side after their 7-1 aggregate victory over Chelsea, and the Blaugrana will have to display a quality which has often been lacking this term in order to progress further.
