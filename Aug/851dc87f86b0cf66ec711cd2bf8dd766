The National Human Rights Commission (NHC) has condemned the recurring practice of human trafficking and other acts that inhabit citizens’ enjoyment of constitutionally guaranteed rights to liberty, human dignity, among others. The Executive Secretary of the NHRC, Tony Ojukwu noted tht despite the abolition of slave trade several decades ago, many countries including Nigeria are still grappling with other forms of modern day slavery such as human trafficking, sexual slavery, child/forced labour, prostitution, enlistment of minors in military service, servitude or removal of organ for pecuniary benefits, osu, ohu and other cast systems etc. Ojukwu, in a statement he issued in commemoration of the 2020 International Day of Remembrance of the Victims of Slavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade (IDRVS), called for a concerted effort to end all forms of modern day slavery to pave the way for full enjoyment of human rights in Nigeria by all the rural and urban poor, the rich, the downtrodden, the displaced and the homeless. NHRC’s spokesman, Fatimah Agwai Mohammed quoted Ojukwu, in the statement, as noting that the long-term effects of transatlantic slave trade, which also have some trappings of racism still reverberate across various societies globally. Mohammed added: “He (Ojukwu) said all hands must be on deck to fight the menace, saying it is high time humanity came to terms with the tenets of human rights which is targeted at enhancing human dignity, equality and respect for fundamental freedoms.
