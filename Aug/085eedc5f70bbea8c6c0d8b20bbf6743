There was low turnout of pupils in Rivers State on Wednesday following the reopening of secondary schools for exit classes. It was gathered that most pupils and teachers were unaware that the school had resumed because the state government gave the directive late on Tuesday. It was, however, observed that most of the schools obeyed the COVID-19 protocols of hygiene and social distancing. Pupils and teachers were mandated to wash their hands with soap before entering the school premises while seats were spaced in classrooms to observe physical distancing. There were no teachers and students at a secondary school at Mile one area of Port Harcourt, but some teachers were present at the High School at Harbour Road. Some parents, who came to make enquiries about the resumption, were also seen in some schools. A Principal of one of the schools, who spoke in confidence, said the late announcement of resumption by the government accounted for the absence of many teachers and students. He said: “The resumption was abrupt. So, many people were not aware of the resumption. But going forward, academic activities will pick up”.
