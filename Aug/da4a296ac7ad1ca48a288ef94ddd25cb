Three lawmakers in Ondo Assembly suspended for alleged gross misconduct have been awarded N15m as damages by an Akure High Court. The three lawmakers are Deputy Speaker, Hon. Ogundeji Iroju; the only woman in the House, Mrs. Favour Tomomowo and Wale Williams. They were among the eight lawmakers that refused to sign the impeachment notice against the Ondo Deputy Governor, Hon Agboola Ajayi. Besides awarding N5m each to the lawmakers, the court also reversed the suspension slammed on them. The lawmakers had through their lawyer, Banjo Ayelakin, sought the protection of the court against their unlawful suspension from the House. Presiding Judge, Justice Ademola Bola, described the suspension as illegal, null and void and of no effect whatsoever. Justice Bola ruled that the House of Assembly as well as other members have no power to suspend any member of the Assembly. The Judge said the suspension violated sections 90, 91, 106 and 117 of the 1999 constitution of Nigeria and ordered the lawmakers reinstated into their positions with immediate effect. Justice Bola ordered that the sum of N5million should be paid to each of the lawmakers as damages.
