 THE Federal Capital Territory Football Association (FCTFA)  has praised its global partner Bayern Munich on winning the  UEFA Champions League title on Sunday. The Bravarians clinched the coveted trophy following a hard-fought 1-0 victory over the Ligue 1 champions Paris Saint Germain in the final of the European competition at Estadio da Luz in Lisbon  on Sunday. The FCTA and the Bavarians  have a solid partnership and  Bayern legend and ambassador Giovane Elber was in Abuja in January to conduct a clinic for selected coaches and graced the Bayern World Youth Cup tournament. A selected team was to represent Nigeria at the Bayern World Youth Cup in Germany in April before all footballing activities were suspended due to the Coronavirus pandemic. “A big congratulations to them (Bayern) on winning the League, Cup and Champions league,” Abuja FA Chairman Mohammed Adam Mouktar said. “It is very heart-warming that a great iconic football brand with amazing success and history like Bayern visited  Nigeria recently earlier in the year with their global brand ambassador Giovanni Elber together with the Bundesliga Cup was a very memorable moment.” “It goes to show it can’t get any better for such an institution to want to do things in Nigeria and Africa at large by showcasing their achievements, history and Getting closer to their global fans.”
