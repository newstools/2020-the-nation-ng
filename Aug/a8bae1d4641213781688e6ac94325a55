LIVERPOOL loanee Taiwo Awoniyi believes he has done enough to get a call-up to the Nigeria national team. The forward has represented the West Africans at the U17, U20 and U23 levels but has struggled to gain attention from the senior national team coaches. The Nigeria prodigy joined Liverpool on a long-term deal in August 2015 from Nigeria’s Imperial Academy but has never played for The Reds due to his inability to secure a work permit.  His sixth loan spell outside of England at German side Mainz ended badly when he suffered a concussion from a serious head injury. “Personally, I feel like I deserve a chance. I recall when I was playing well and scoring goals in Belgium. Nigeria had a friendly game and I thought I had done enough to get a look in that would hopefully enhance my quest for a UK work permit, but I was overlooked.  “You begin to understand that it’s not something you can control or have power over. You just need to enjoy what you do and keep on working hard.” “I can never underestimate the impact of faith on my life and career. God used the referee [Marco Fritz] on the pitch before they took me to the hospital,” Awoniyi told BBC Sport Africa. “I fell awkwardly and that image scared a lot of people including my family and friends, but the quick intervention of the referee and medics from both clubs was swift. “Most significantly, I recovered remarkably quickly and it was a moment of deep reflection about God when I left the hospital. “Faith means everything to me; I put it above football and faith provides one possible explanation as to why we are all here and alive.”
