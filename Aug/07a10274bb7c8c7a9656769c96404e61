Consumers of dairy product, especially Hollandia branded Lactose Free Milk, unveiled to the public in September 2019, now have a chance to understand the benefits of the nutrients in the Hollandia brand. Lactose intolerance is simply the inability of the digestive system to completely digest lactose, a naturally occurring sugar in milk, and break it into simple sugars that can be absorbed by the body. The condition is prevalent in Nigeria, but its low awareness means many consumers are unable to connect it with symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, gas, nausea, and diarrhea shortly after consuming milk or milk products.  It is challenging to get enough dietary calcium when you are lactose intolerant and have to avoid dairy products. However, Hollandia Lactose Free Milk is a healthy nourishing milk full of dietary calcium and other essential vitamins and minerals. According to Chi Limited Marketing Director, Mrs. Toyin Nnodi, “the solution for lactose intolerance should neither be avoidance nor regulation of milk consumption, but rather continued education about the condition and consumption of a nourishing Lactose Free Milk – which is what Hollandia Lactose Free Milk represents,” adding that by educating consumers on how they can keep milk in their diet without discomfort they experience, Hollandia Lactose Free Milk is offering consumers the taste and nourishment they desire in a way that meets their specific needs.
