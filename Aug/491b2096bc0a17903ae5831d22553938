 AFROBEATS artistes, Fiki and EeFlat, have come up with a song for the season, one which they hope will uplift people’s spirits. The single, ‘Love to the beat’ was released on streaming platforms last week and is reportedly attracting viewers in large numbers. Following their recent song together, fans have begun pointing out the chemistry between Fiki and EeFlat as the two singers appear to complement each other with ease.

Despite being just a few days after hitting online platforms, Fiki expresses delight at the reception the song has been getting and being able to lift the spirits of fans with the present time being an unprecedented one.
