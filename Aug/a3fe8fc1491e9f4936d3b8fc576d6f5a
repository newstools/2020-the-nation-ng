The election security threat analysis report of the police warning of violence in the Edo governorship election is an affirmation of our previous petitions and warnings on the criminal arms build-up by Governor Godwin Obaseki and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the All Progressives Congress (APC) has said. It reacted to the report made public by the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, which warned of the occurrence of violence and other illegalities during the election due to indicators, including arming and movement of thugs, use of inciting statements during campaigns, high likelihood of violence and possible cross attack by political opponents, misinformation/disinformation aimed at heating up the polity, among others. In a statement by Mr. John Mayaki, the chairman of the Edo APC Media Campaign Council, the APC says the report backs its previous allegations of arms build-up against Governor  Obaseki and the ferrying of thugs from neighbouring PDP states, most notably Delta State. Citing the attack on the Edo Assembly complex and the arrest of seven persons caught with firearms during the invasion, the APC said the incident exposed Governor Obaseki’s direct involvement in the arming and funding of thugs to carry out attacks across the state as he allegedly mounted pressure on the police to secure the release of the suspects, who have now been charged to court.
