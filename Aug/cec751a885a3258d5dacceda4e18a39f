Premium lager beer, Hero, is set to reward its consumers with the launch of the “Rise like a Hero” campaign. Consumers will get a chance to win cash prizes of N10,000 and N50,000 through an e-draw. Grand prize winners of N1million will emerge weekly. The campaign, which kicked off on August 1, was launched to appreciate the support of Nigerians who have stuck with the Hero brand over the years. Marketing Director, International Breweries, Tolulope Adedeji said Hero was on a mission to appreciate Nigerians this season. “When we launched Hero into the Nigerian market eight years ago, we knew we had a good product that would do well. “However, our expectations have not only been met but also surpassed due to the unalloyed support of our numerous consumers. “And so, we decided to demonstrate our appreciation by giving back to our partners. We consider our consumers as partners on this journey because Hero is all about them and their satisfaction. “Over the next couple of weeks, consumers of Hero will have an opportunity to win airtime and cash gifts while they enjoy their favourite beer, so it’s a win-win for them,” she said.
