The Senior Special Assistant to Edo State Deputy Governor, Mr. Benjamin Atu, has urged people to give Governor Godwin Obaseki and his running mate, Philip Shaibu, the mandate to continue in office. He said: “The volumes of the programmes and projects of the Obaseki administration are creating wealth and job opportunities, reviving collapsed business enterprises, stimulating agriculture and local food production. “Democracy can’t be more decent and responsive than what we have seen and witnessed in Edo State under the current administration. “In fact, Governor Obaseki has demonstrated to us the true bible of democracy and it requires our efforts in moving democracy forward by ensuring his re-election.” Atu, in a statement, said the very few, most vocal critics of Governor Obaseki were those who were failures during their era at the state and federal levels, who couldn’t blaze their trail and who owed Edo State people an apology for mismanagement of the state’s resources.
