Bauchi Commissioner for Commerce and Industry Hon Mohammed Al-Hassan Sadiq has resigned. Sadiq, who posted the resignation on his Facebook page on Wednesday evening said: “Alhamdulillah, Masha Allah. Every beginning has an end. “Today, the 19th day of August, 2020, I have honourably tendered my voluntary resignation as a Commissioner (Ministry of Commerce & Industries) and a Member of the State Executive Council in the Government of Bauchi State. “It was a rare privilege and opportunity to have served my state in such an exalted position. “I thank H.E the Executive Governor – Sen. Bala A. Mohammed (Kauran Bauchi) for the wonderful opportunity accorded to me. “In the same vein, I must appreciate my boss, H.E, the Rt. Hon. Yakubu Dogara for his usual support and the role he played in influencing same. “I sincerely thank all my colleagues in the EXCO and the Ministry, whom we have worked with as a formidable team. I have enjoyed the understanding of my family at such a trying time. “I beseech God to forgive all my wrongs and the general public/colleagues to pardon me. “I urge you to help me, pray God to grant me success, contentment and peace of mind in my new endeavor. Thank you all and remain blessed.” Sadiq is the second commissioner to quit Governor Bala Mohammed’s cabinet. Former Commissioner for Finance, Nura Manu Soro, resigned after barely three months in office. The Nation learnt Sadiq was pressurised to resign because he is one of the core loyalists of former House of Representatives Speaker Yakubu Dogara, who the Governor is allegedly determined to get rid of. The development is not unconnected with the fall-out between Mohammed and Dogara after the latter defected to the All Progressive Congress (APC) and accused the Governor of running a one-man show
