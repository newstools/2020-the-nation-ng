Chief Executive Officer, ZL Empire State, a record label and entertainment company and founder, BTCBARS group, Ulochukwu Ebenezer celebrated his 24th birthday by bailing out prison inmates with lesser or minor crimes. Ebenezar who made this gesture in collaboration with Shamies Unusual Hearts Foundation said that his philanthropy is part of his established tradition that takes place yearly by sponsoring the release of some prisoners with lesser crimes whose freedom had been stalled by their inability to pay for their bail bond. Spokesman for the Ebenezar, Chuks Golden revealed that after the birthday tour, 15 persons were released from SARS office in Abuja. The tour which started in Ebenezerâ€™s base in Asaba, Delta State, on August 12, 2020, saw six inmates released in Makurdi, Benue State, four in Sokoto and five from Jos prison. The front line entrepreneur noted that though detention of pronounced criminals by courts of relevant jurisdiction is justified, it is not ideal to continue to deny minor offenders of their freedom as a result of inability to pay for their release. He identified lack of job opportunities as one of the major reasons why some youths indulge in unnecessary crimes and urged government to put critical measures in place to secure the future of the youths. The young CEO who cut his birthday cake with the inmates, gave out television sets and one year subscription of DSTV, slippers and disinfectants.
He also gave an orientation speech on how to live life outside prison. He further urged good spirited individuals and corporate organisations to bring their humanitarian gesture to bare in the lives of every downtrodden in the society, particularly those seeking for freedom.
