President Muhammadu Buhari has been urged to stop the imposition of the six percent stamp duty tax on tenants immediately. In a press statement signed by a renowned socio-political activist and critic, Chief Adesunbo Onitiri, he said this would create another burden that will further impoverish the Nigerian masses and make life unbearable for them. The socio-political activist noted that the people are already saddled with heavy taxes, thus weighing down the Nigerian people. “Fuel pump price had been increased from N123/ litre to N143.8/ litre. This has increased the cost of transportation and food stuff which had created a big hole in the pockets of our people,”he said. He advised the government to cut down the humongous cost of governance and fight the reckless corruption in high places. Onitiri pointed out that the people cannot be held responsible for the reckless fraud and incompetence in government. According  to Onitiri, it is the duty of government to serve the people with dividends of democracy and not to impoverish them. “It is a pity that the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) that is supposed to protect the interest of the people and other Human Rights organisations have been heavily compromised.
