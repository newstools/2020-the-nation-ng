CCTV footage appears to show how a 30-year-old man raped an 11-year-old girl in Sapele, Delta State. The incident happened last Wednesday, The Nation learnt. Details remain sketchy but a source said the victim was assaulted when she went to use a convenience room, from where she came out minutes later crying and saying she had been abused by the suspect. The suspect simply identified as Jomaph was said to have denied violating the young girl and threatened to arrest her and her family members. But a CCTV camera installed by a neighbour for business reportedly exposed him in the act. Police spokeswoman Onome Onowakpoyeya confirmed the incident yesterday, noting that she was yet to get an official report on the incident. “The incident happened,” she said, adding, “They said, initially, the man denied, until they brought the CCTV footage and he owned up.” In Nasarawa, a primary school teacher was arrested for raping his pupil in Obi Local Government Area of the state. The victim said her teacher sent her to fetch a broom in the classroom after closing hours, and followed her and forcibly defiled and caused serious injuries on her. Police spokesman Ramhan Nansel confirmed the incident. A Magistrates’ Court in Lagos yesterday ordered that 49-year-old Uchenna Uzoma be remanded in a correctional centre after he was charged with defiling his neighbour’s 11-year-old daughter. Another court in the state also ordered the remand of one Abdulrouf Akande, 55, after it heard that he allegedly defiled a 10-year-old girl.
