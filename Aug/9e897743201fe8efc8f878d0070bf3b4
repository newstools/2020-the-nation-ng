 FRONTLINE health workers in fight against Coronavirus pandemic have again issued a fresh strike notice to the Federal Government over disparity in the payment of Covid -19 hazard allowance. The health workers under the umbrella body of Medical and Health Workers Union of Nigeria (MHWUN) warned that they cannot guarantee industrial harmony in the health system if the ten percent wrongly paid to some of its members as Covid-19 allowance was not addressed by relevant authorities. National President of MHWUN, Comrade Josiah Biobelemoye, stated this when he led a delegation to the Chief Medical Director (CMD) of University of Abuja Teaching Hospital (UATH), Prof. Ekele Bisalla, to check on its members working in the isolation facility. Biobelemoye said the union has resolved to shut down the health system if government didnâ€™t correct the anomaly before payment of the third batch of the Covid-19 allowances.
