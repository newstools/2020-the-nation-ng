 MINISTER of State for Petroleum Resources Timipre Sylva has inaugurated a committee to map out strategies and modalities for establishment of Oloibiri Museum and Research Centre (OMRC) in Oloibiri, Bayelsa State. At a virtual event on Wednesday, Sylva said building the musuem would be a unique opportunity to correct a historical oversight. A statement by the ministry’s Deputy Director (Information) Enefaa Bob-Manuel said the museum would preserve the heritage and historical developments in Nigeria’s oil sector, adding that the plan had been on for over three decades. The scope of the project, according to the minister, would capture construction of a museum where oil and gas historic developments, data, equipment, and tools would be housed for posterity. Also, the scope would include construction of a functional research centre where prototypes could be tested and validated in fulfilment of the requirement for approval of new technologies. When completed, the OMRC will aid the retention of historical artefacts of Nigeria’s oil and gas journey, dissemination of knowledge across generations, creation of an attractive destination for tourists, restoration of the image of Oloibiri community among others.
