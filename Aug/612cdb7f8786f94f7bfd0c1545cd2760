The governorship candidate of the Peoples Party of Nigeria (PPN), Mr. John Iyoha, has urged the police to be non-partisan in the September 19 election. Speaking at the weekend in Benin, he said the tension in the state ahead of the poll was unnecessary. Iyoha appealed to Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Mohammed Adamu to be apolitical in the interest of the masses. He said: “The IGP should make it clear to his officers and men that their loyalty in Edo must be with the people, to prevent what happened in Kogi and Bayelsa states last year. “It has become imperative for IGP Adamu to declare his position as a non-partisan boss. “Since the beginning of electioneering ahead of the governorship poll in Edo State, there has been tension in the state. “There have been allegations of using federal might against the people. “I urge IGP Adamu and other security chiefs to caution their men that will be drafted to the state.”
