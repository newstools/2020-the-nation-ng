US-based turntable star, Allwell John Ibama aka DJ Kev has been honoured for his contribution to promoting Afrobeats in the diaspora. The Rivers State-born act bagged Best African DJ (Diaspora) and Best Independent DJ (Universal) by African Fashion And Music Award (AFRIFAMU) Hollywood and African Prestigious Awards (HAPA), respectively. Speaking of the honours, DJ Kev says the awards would push him to work to improve on his trade. “I feel blessed and highly favored to be granted these two awards back to back and it showed me that I have people out there that love and support what I do. These awards made me realize that I was meant and ready for the industry and it also makes me want to work harder,” he said. Reminiscing on his journey and how he became Teni’s official DJ, the turntable expert says, “When I moved to LA I started from ground zero. I did not know anybody in the music industry. I always knew this is what I wanted and so I made sure I went for it. I started going from club to club where I met Lentini. Big shout to Peter Lentini for paving the way and pushing the Afrobeat culture in Los Angeles. I also got the opportunity to work with a lot of artists like Runtown, Davido, Timaya, Tiwa Savage, Yemi Alade, Teni, and the list goes on. By the way, a lot of people do not know that I am Teni’s official DJ.”
