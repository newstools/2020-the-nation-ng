 FIRE on Saturday razed at least seven buildings and 30 shops at popular Ladipo Street in Mushin, Lagos. The inferno, which started around 3pm inside a mattress shop at 16, Ladipo  Street, was said to have rapidly spread to other structures as a result of the closeness of the buildings to the shop. Despite the timely arrival of officials of the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) Response Unit (LRU), it was gathered that the crowd at the location made it difficult for the officials to combat the inferno. The Nation gathered that affected properties included a storey building, 30 shops and six bungalows. The storey building, according to the LASEMA, had six rooms and four shops; five bungalows with 26 shops; a bungalow with a three- bedroom flat. According to the LASEMA Director General (DG), Dr. Femi Oke-Osanyintolu, the crowd posed operational challenges by refusing to listen to the authorities and ensure appropriate distance for the officials to function. He said the fire was later contained and firemen dampened the area to prevent a secondary occurrence. Oke-Osanyintolu said the affected structures were pulled down as a result of visible cracks on them which could result  in their collapse if allowed to stand. “The affected buildings have been completely demolished. A secondary incident has been averted; operation concluded and response team heading back to base. “There was no loss of lives or injury. The public is advised to take reasonable safety precautions to reduce the risk of fire outbreaks in their places of business and homes,” he said.
