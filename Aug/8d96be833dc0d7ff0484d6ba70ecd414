The Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Pantami, has called for shifting of focus from acquisition of certificates to skills education for the actualisation of Nigeria’s digital economic drive. Pantami spoke on Tuesday in Abuja at the graduation lecture of the National Defence Collage Course 28, titled: Digital Economy and National Development in Nigeria. The minister noted that digital literacy and skills were among the pillars outlined for the development of the digital economy of Nigeria in line with the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS). He said emphasis on certificate must be reduced in engaging labour force, stressing that focus should be shifted to skills, if the nation must catch up with development. Pantami said many developed and developing countries, such as China, the United States (U.S.A) and Morocco, had shifted attention to skills rather than certificates. According to him, many of them have established skills centres for their citizens to acquire requisite knowledge. Pantami noted that though certificate is important, but it is secondary to skill. The minister said this is why Nigeria must pay attention to skills in its journey to digital economy. “The digital literacy and skills pillar recognises the fact that citizens are the greatest assets in any economy, including the digital economy. It will support the development of a large pool of digitally literate and digitally skilled citizens. “We recently provided a platform, the Digital Nigeria .gov.ng platform, to enable Nigerians receive training in diverse digital skills. Over 36,000 Nigerians have enrolled on the platform since April 2, 2020.” “We are championing a paradigm change that lays emphasis on skills, in preference to merely having degrees without skills,” he said.
