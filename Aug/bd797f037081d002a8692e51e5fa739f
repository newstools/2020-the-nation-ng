The governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Edo State, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, and the state’s Deputy Governor, Philip Shaibu, are trading blame over gunshots at Jattu in Edo North Senatorial District. Ize-Iyamu, through the Chairman of Edo APC Media Campaign Council, Prince John Mayaki, yesterday in Benin, alleged that armed thugs, mobilised by Shaibu, occupied the venue of the party’s rally at Jattu, thereby scaring residents and supporters of the APC with gunshots. He said: “The thugs, chanting war songs, insisted on preventing the APC rally from holding, as Edo deputy governor is keen on demonstrating his capacity for violence to Governor Godwin Obaseki and other members of the PDP, who are battling him for the control of PDP’s campaign funds. “Eyewitnesses at Jattu confirmed the arrival of the armed thugs in a convoy led by Shaibu at Jattu Junction, where they proceeded to the venue of the APC rally, shooting recklessly and causing terror. Some residents fled the area for safety, as some of the thugs pour on the streets, seeking APC leaders to attack.” Shaibu, reacting through his Senior Special Assistant on Media, Benjamin Atu, however, denied the allegations. He said: “The allegations are not true. Edo deputy governor was in the home of the late Speaker of Edo House of Assembly, Zakawanu, for the 40 days prayer, in line with Muslim practice. How can a man in prayer session with others be accused of such allegations? “Ize-Iyamu lies to survive. He spins lies like rain. One day, one lie. Is that the kind of life he has fashioned out for himself? “Today (yesterday), four PDP members were gunned  down at Agbede by APC thugs at a PDP rally. Even the deputy governor’s campaign vehicle was attacked. The victims are at Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital in Edo State. Ize-Iyamu has the attitude of always being the first to cry.”
