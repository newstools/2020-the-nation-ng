Markets in Akure were on Monday closed, following directives by the Deji of Akure Kingdom, Oba Aladetoyinbo Ogunlade Aladelusi that markets and shops should not open for business. This was to observe the annual Aheregbe and Amole Festival. Only pharmaceutical stores were allowed to open. Besides traders in the markets, shop owners, restaurant operators and fast food did not open for business. The festival is an age long tradition where the Sipi traditionalists dance round Akure and its environs. Any shop found open for business would be looted, which is why the festival is referred to as ‘Du du du’, meaning ‘take your own I take my own’. Markets and shops in Akure are also to be shut on September 9. The festival did not restrict human and vehicular movement in Akure.
