THE £85million England international Harry Maguire will be spending a second day in jail after he was  allegedly involved in a bust-up with a group of other Englishmen before becoming ‘very abusive and aggressive’ towards officers who arrived to intervene on the island of Mykonos. Maguire, 27, spent the night in a cell along with two other men thought to be fellow players, aged 28 and 29, and the trio has been transferred to the neighbouring island of Syros where they will appear before the state prosecutor tomorrow on charges including aggravated assault, verbal assault and attempted bribery.  The maximum sentennce for bribery in Greece is three years in prison but Maguire’s lawyer said he denies all wrongdoing. She said: ‘Maguire denies the allegations against him. Fortunately, we will get rid of it tomorrow.’ The chief prosecutor told local media that he expects Maguire to make an apology at the hearing.
