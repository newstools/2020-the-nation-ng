There is palpable anxiety among chieftains and members of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in Abia State over rumours that have refused to go away despite denials by some of those concerned. Fears that the party’s flag bearer at the 2015 and 2019 governorship elections, Dr. Alex Otti, may have concluded plans to leave the party is causing ripples within his party. While it is still convenient to describe the worrisome information as a rumour, Sentry learnt that the body language of some players on the political scene across the state is daily making the story more believable. Not even statements by some aides and allies of the APGA candidate have been able to put the matter to rest. As it is, many chieftains and members of the party are already wondering what the party will look like if Otti should leave. To further compound the state of anxiety in Abia politics, chieftains and members of the two leading political parties in the state, especially the ruling Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP), are also eager to know where Otti would be heading should he finally dump APGA. The opposition All Progressives Congress (APC) is not left out of the waiting game, as all and sundry keep wondering whether Otti will leave APGA or not.
