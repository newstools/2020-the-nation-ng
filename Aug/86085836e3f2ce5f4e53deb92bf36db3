Liverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold has been named the Premier League Young Player of the Season. The 21-year-old appeared in all 38 league games as the Reds ended their 30-year wait for a top-flight title in dominant fashion. A key man in the division’s meanest defence, Alexander-Arnold also evidenced his value as an attacking outlet for the champions. His 13 assists saw him finish second to Kevin De Bruyne in the overall standings and break his own record for goals set up by a defender in a single league campaign. Those contributions were enough to see off competition from Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial, Mason Greenwood, Dean Henderson, Christian Pulisic, Mason Mount and Jack Grealish for the award. Alexander-Arnold is also in the running for the senior version of the Premier League’s Player of the Season gong. He is joined by teammates Sadio Mane and Jordan Henderson on the shortlist, as well as De Bruyne, Danny Ings, Nick Pope and Jamie Vardy.
