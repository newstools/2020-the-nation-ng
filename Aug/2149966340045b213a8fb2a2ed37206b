 THE National Executive Committee (NEC) of the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) has cleared Deputy Governor Agboola Ajayi to contest the October governorship election on its platform. Ajayi resigned from the All Progressives Congress (APC) in June and joined the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) where he contested the party’s primaries in July, but failed to clinch the ticket. He met former governor Olusegun Mimiko and got into talks of running on ZLP’s platform. His application was sent to the NEC of the party, which met last weekend and approved his application. Ondo State Chairman of the ZLP, Mr. Joseph Akinlaja, confirmed the clearance of Ajayi in a phone chat. He said Ajayi would formally join the ZLP tomorrow. Akinlaja said the ZLP was poised to win the governorship poll in October.
