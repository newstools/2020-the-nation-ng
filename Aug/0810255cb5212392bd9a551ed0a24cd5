CardinalStone Partners Limited, a multi-asset investment management firm, has completed its N5 billion debut Commercial Paper (CP) issuance which was oversubscribed by 48 per cent. The company had set out to raise N5 billion in the first tranche under its N10 billion Commercial Paper Programme recently registered with FMDQ Securities Exchange Limited. However, subscriptions totaling N7.1 billion were received from individual and institutional investors including asset managers, pension fund administrators amongst others. The Series I 270-day CP was issued at an effective yield of seven per cent. This subscription level demonstrates investors’ confidence in the company and the ability of its management team to deliver value. The company’s Group Managing Director, Michael Nzewi, said he was pleased with the outcome of the Commercial Paper Issuance. He said the funds from the CP issuance would enable the company to diversify its financing mix and fund its working capital requirements. “This issuance is expected to consolidate CardinalStone’s position as a credible borrower in the Nigerian capital market while at the same time setting a precedence for commercial paper issuance by a non-bank affiliated financial services business,” Nzewi stated. FBNQuest Merchant Bank Limited acted as Lead Arranger & Dealer while FCMB Capital Markets Limited and CardinalStone Partners Limited were Joint Arrangers on the debut commercial paper transaction.
