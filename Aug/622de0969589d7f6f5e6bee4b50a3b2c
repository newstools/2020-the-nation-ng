 THE Lagos State Government on Thursday handed cash gifts to 31 victims of a May 25 windstorm in Badagry, with a promise to continue next week. The beneficiaries who were assembled at the Badagry council secretariat, received N500,000, N400,000 and N200,000 depending on the severity of damage to their properties. The Nation reports that four communities, Iragbo, Ikoga, Iragon-Igbo-Iji and Kemu suffered extreme weather conditions that affected about 30 houses and schools. Many of the affected buildings collapsed; others had their roofs blown away, prompting pleas for help.
