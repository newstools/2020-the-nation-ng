 Former Super Eagles skipper and Paris Saint Germain icon, Austin Jay-Jay Okocha has urged the French side to go all out and subdue the dreaded Bayern Munich in the UEFA Champions League outing on Sunday. The former Bolton Wanderers of England captain sent a message of encouragement to the playing and coaching staff of his former club on twitter as both sides prepared for a showdown in the Cup final. The legendary Nigerian star spent four pleasant years in Paris, lifting both the Trophée des Champions and UEFA Intertoto Cup before departing the Parc Des Princes in 2002. But despite playing alongside some of the best footballers the game had ever seen, including Brazilian midfield dazzler, Ronaldinho, Okocha could never inspire PSG to the latter stages of Europe’s premier club competition. Neymar, Mbappe, and co have succeeded where others failed though, having led the nine-time French champions to their first-ever Champions League final.  They face one of the continent’s most successful sides in Bayern Munich on Sunday night and Okocha, while lauding the team for coming this far, has charged them to get the job done. “I just want to say congratulations to the players and the coach on qualifying for the Champions League final. I wish them the best for the final,” the former Super Eagles hero said in a video posted on the PSG Twitter account. Okocha then added in French: “Go Paris!”
