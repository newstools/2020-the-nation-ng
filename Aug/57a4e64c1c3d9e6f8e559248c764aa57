The Premier League 2020-21 opening day fixtures have been revealed as Leeds travel to Liverpool in the day’s headline game. The 2019-20 champions will host Marcelo Bielsa’s men for their first match back in the top flight in 16 years, on Saturday September 12. Neither Manchester United nor Manchester City will be on show after having their opening weekend games postponed. The pair were given an extended break due to their prolonged participation in Europe. Man United’s opening game was due to be away to Burnley, while City were set to host Aston Villa. Elsewhere, Arsenal head to newly-promoted Fulham and Tottenham host Everton on the opening day, with all Saturday matches currently scheduled for 3pm but likely to be changed for TV. Crystal Palace host Southampton, Leicester travel to West Brom and West Ham will welcome Newcastle in the only other opening day games. But the opening weekend’s headline act is unquestionably Liverpool’s game with Leeds. In a baptism of fire for Marcelo Bielsa’s men, they face the daunting prospect of going up against Jurgen Klopp’s rampant Reds on Merseyside for their first taste of Premier League action since their 2003-04 relegation. Meanwhile, Man Utd have been handed a gruelling opening fixture list with Spurs, Arsenal and Chelsea all to play in their first six matches. Football fans may be able to watch some of the early games live INSIDE stadiums too, after the latest update from the Government. Trials of allowing some fans back in stadiums will be tested later that month ahead of a planned full rollout in October while spectators will be made to sign up to a new code of behaviour.
