Founder of Christ Embassy, Pastor Chris Oyakhilome is blessed with two pretty daughters and one of them – Sharon, clocked 25 on Monday, August 10. Sharon, who is a gospel singer, decided to make this year’s birthday a memorable one by releasing an EP, ‘The Other Side,’ on the same day. This must have given her sleepless nights as she just dropped an EP ‘CSO’ last month. The excited woman thanked her crew for making the release of her new EP possible, as well as fans who have showered her with love and birthday wishes. Born and raised in England, Sharon got married in 2018 to a Ghanaian, Philip Frimpong. Although her father and mother Anita Ebhodaghe, parted ways in 2016 after 25 years of marriage, Sharon and her sister, Charlyn, have grown up adorably.
