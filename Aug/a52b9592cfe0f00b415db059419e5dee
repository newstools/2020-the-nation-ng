Controversy trailing who becomes the Osun Osogbo priest takes another turn on Saturday as Ataoja palace chiefs and devotees hold out against an Osun priest, Chief Olayiwola Adigun to take control of the deity’s temple. The Osun deity temple was located inside the premises of Ataoja of Osogbo’s palace, Oba Jimoh Oyetunji and has been a subject to litigation since August 2019, when the monarch appointed another priest to take hold of the temple. Barely few hours to the grand finale of the annual Osun-Osogbo festival in 2019, an Osun State High Court sitting in Osogbo, restrained the Ataoja of Osogbo, Oba Jimoh Oyetunji from usurping the duties of Osun priest for another, appointed by him. However, the monarch applies for a stay of execution which was also struck out May this year by the court. The Nation learnt that a copy of the court pronouncement was placed on the temple’s wall on Friday. Priest Olayiwola and his followers arrived the palace around 10am and headed for the temple, where he worshipped the deity before the arrival of some palace chiefs and factional leaders of the temple arrived. Their arrival led to argument as to the legality of access to the temple. While Olayiwola said he has come to take charge of the temple, the new priest simply referred to as Moshood also lay claim to the duties of the temple. A palace chief instructed the Police Sergeant attached to the palace to throw Olayiwola and his aides out of the palace, but the priest quickly said there was no need since they were not at the temple for a fight before asking his aides to vacate temple.
