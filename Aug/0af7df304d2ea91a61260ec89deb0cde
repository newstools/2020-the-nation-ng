  The Director-General, Industrial Training Fund (ITF) Joseph Arii has urged agencies and organisations to partner with the Fund to tackle the challenge of high rate of unemployment, and poverty in the country. He said the high rate of unemployment in the country among other issues, has impacted negatively on the economy thus jeopardising national security and socio-economic development. Ari spoke yesterday during the kick-off Ceremony of ITF-NCDMB Vocational Training programme in Abuja, stating that the absence of matching skills with industry needs has heightened youth unemployment. He added that this was what brought about the skills gap assessment survey in the six priority sectors of the economy which ITF conducted in partnership with UNIDO in 2017. The sectors are agro-allied, construction, oil and gas, metal and solid minerals, light manufacturing and services. The major objective of the study was to provide information on industrial skills demand, supply and gaps in the country, since skills form the bedrock of every countryâ€™s economy. However, having skills is not enough; to achieve growth, both for a country and for an individual, skill must be put to productive use at work. The Minister of State, Industry Trade and Investment Mariam Katagum noted that President Muhammadu Buhari identified poverty and job creation as key priority areas of this administration. It is therefore heartwarming to note that the ITF has fully keyed into this initiative and is reaching out to different partners in order to actualize this policy, he said.
