Members of the National Association of Ondo State Students (NAOSS) are to meet the governorship candidates of parties, to know their programmes. NAOSS said the meeting was necessary because of the hardship faced by students. Speaking to reporters in Akure, NAOSS President Ayoade Kikiowo said the meeting titled ‘Conversation Ondo’, will enable students and youth leaders to ask the candidates what programmes they have for students. He said: “As the Ondo State governorship election draws near, a cross-delivery of electoral manifestos and demands have become pertinent for informed electoral choices. Youths and students, as a huge fraction of the populace, become a focal point.”
