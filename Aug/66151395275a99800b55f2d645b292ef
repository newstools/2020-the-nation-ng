The body of one Mr. Garba Joseph, 43, has been recovered by the Federal Capital Territory Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). FEMA’s Search and Rescue team recovered the body after a two-day search from a flooded river near Trade Moore Estate, Lugbe, Abuja, following a heavy downpour last Wednesday. Director-General, FEMA Alhaji Idriss Abbas has emphasised the need for residents to adhere to instructions and early warnings from relevant authorities. An eyewitness Kenneth Chima said, “They were four men that tried walking through the water and I kept warning them to go back. Three of them went back but only this man insisted on crossing, unfortunately he was washed away”. Abbas attributed the increasing rate of flooding in the FCT to residents’ apathy to government’s directives and early warnings. He appealed to residents to desist from dumping  waste disposal on water ways or building on flood plains. In another development, FEMA and police officials have rescued three persons  after a truck crashed into their home in Madala area of the FCT on Saturday. The three persons sustained injuries and were taken to hospital.
