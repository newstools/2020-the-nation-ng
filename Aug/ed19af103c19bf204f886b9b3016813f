 PALPABLE fear has gripped residents of Isheri and Baruwa areas of Lagos State following an early morning spillage of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) into their drainage from a Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation’s (NNPC) system 2B pipeline. The spillage, which was discovered around 5:45 a.m by residents of Peace Estate near Petrocam Gas Station, was said to have started at Iyana Odo Bus Stop following activities of pipeline vandals. The Nation gathered that pipeline vandalism has continued to surge despite cases of explosions that have led to the loss of lives and properties in the axis this year. Already, emergency workers, including officials of the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), Lagos Fire Service and a repair team from NNPC have been deployed to the area to prevent a fire outbreak. LASEMA Director-General (DG) Dr. Femi Oke-Osanyintolu said they have begun coverage of the area to mop up the spilled PMS. “NNPC has suspended pumping operations. Emergency workers are currently on the ground to prevent a secondary incident,” he said.
