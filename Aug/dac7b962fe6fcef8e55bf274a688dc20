Interior Minister Rauf Aregbesola has described the late American Ambassador to Nigeria, Walter Carrington, as a hero and a legend whose life will be irreplaceable in the hearts many people. Carrington died on August 11 at 90. “Ambassador Carrington is a hero and a legend. His place in our hearts is irreplaceable and therefore we mourn his passage into the pantheon of Black legends,” he wrote in a condolence letter to the wife of the late diplomat. The minister noted that the late Carrington gave no inkling of death, even at 90, as he had portrayed himself gracefully till his last moments. “As I mentioned in my birthday eulogy to him, I listened to him at the June 12 commemoration webinar: ‘His recollections were accurate, his thoughts vivid and poignant. He was calm, cool and measured in his delivery, never losing a chain of thought.’ We could have falsely presumed he would live forever, his advanced age notwithstanding,” Aregbesola wrote. He also eulogised the late Carrington for dedicating his life to human emancipation and his involvement in the Nigerian project till the end. “Ambassador Carrington lived a whole life dedicated to humanity and people of colour and was a lover of Nigeria. He fought against injustice, military dictatorship and was involved in the Nigerian project till the very end,” Aregbesola wrote.
