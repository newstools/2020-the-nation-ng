The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) gubernatorial candidate in Edo State, Governor Godwin Obaseki, has received the endorsement of Edo North traditional rulers. The traditional ruler of Agenebode, His Royal Highness George Egabor, and the traditional ruler of Weppa Clan, His Royal Highness Moses Akpamuka Etsu, both in Etsako East Local Government Area of Edo State, were among several traditional rulers to back Governor Obaseki and his deputy, Phillip Shaibu. Egador, receiving the governor during a campaign visit, said: “You have had the ability of keeping public funds even before your visit to my palace to seek election for your first tenure.  “I wasn’t a magician when I said to you then that you were going to win. But your good financial pedigree in keeping public funds stands you out. “We commend you for the successful management of the state’s resources. You have done more with less resources.” The traditional ruler of Weppa Clan said the endorsement of the governor and his deputy was as a result of the administration’s achievements in the last three years and eight months. The governor and his deputy were also conferred with chieftaincy titles. Obaseki was honoured as the ‘Ozemoya of Weppa Clan’, a man who took his people from grass to grace, while his deputy, Shaibu, was conferred with the ‘Oyiatse of Weppa Clan’, a man who assists others to get to the topmost position.
