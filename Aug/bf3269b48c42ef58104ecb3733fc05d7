 EDO State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has urged the state’s electorate not to be afraid to come out and vote on September 19. He expressed optimism of emerging victorious during the crucial election, in spite of the challenge by Edo governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, who earlier stated that by God’s grace and the votes of residents of the state, he would be inaugurated as Edo governor on November 12 this year. Obaseki, the standard bearer of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), spoke yesterday in Benin, the state capital, while addressing his supporters who put up a carnival-like march, termed: “Umbrella March,” to reinforce their support for him. The march, which was organised by the Edo Voters Volunteers Assembly (EVVA), a grassroots voter mobilisation body, had over 2000 participants, made up of youths and women, mobilised from the 12 wards in Oredo Local Government Area of the state. The march temporarily halted commercial activities in the early hours of yesterday in Benin. Obaseki urged Edo electorate to report acts of criminality by any person or group of persons to the appropriate authorities to forestall a breakdown of law and order, in the run-up to the governorship election.
