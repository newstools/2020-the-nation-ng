 Kiddwaya has revealed how his billionaire dad, Terry Waya, bailed former Bayelsa Governor, late Diepreye Alamieyeseigha from the UK prison in 2005. Kidd disclosed this during his wager task on Thursday night. Speaking to other Housemates, Kidd said his dad bailed Alamieyeseigha and the act landed him in trouble with the UK government. “My father was the one who bailed the late Chief D.S.P Alamieyeseigha of Bayelsa State out of prison back then.  “He has everybody’s back and he’s loyal to you no matter what. But he does not expect anything in return from anyone,” he said. Diepreye Alamieyeseigha was detained in London on charges of money laundering in September 2005. At the time of his arrest, Metropolitan police found about £1m in cash in his London home. Later they found a total of £1.8m ($3.2m) in cash and bank accounts. He was found to own four homes in London worth an alleged £10 million.
