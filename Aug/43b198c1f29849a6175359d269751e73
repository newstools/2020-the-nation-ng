Foreign investments in the  Nigerian market have dropped to their lowest in recent years as investors bemoaned foreign exchange control and illiquidity. Foreign portfolio report at the weekend showed that Nigeria’s foreign portfolio investments (FPIs) dropped to a new low last month, after hitting a 29-month low in May 2020. Total FPIs dropped from its previous low of N35.24 billion in May  to a new low of N34.59 billion or $89 million in July 2020, reversing the dead cat bounce of N56.3 billion or $90.89 million recorded in June. Total FPIs included inflows and outflows. While inflows and outflows indicate direction of portfolio transactions, FPI measures the momentum and level of participation The FPI report, coordinated by the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), included transactions from nearly all custodians and capital market operators and it is widely regarded as a credible measure of FPI trend. The report uses two key indicators-inflow and outflow, to gauge foreign investors’ mood and participation in the stock market as a barometer for the economy. Analysts were unanimous that the continuing decline in foreign investments was due to foreign exchange illiquidity orchestrated by Central Bank of Nigeria’s (CBN) capital controls programme. Afrinvest Securities said the introduction of capital controls amid foreign exchange illiquidity had left foreign investors stuck in the market and made Nigeria less attractive as an investment destination. “The wide premium between exchange rates at the parallel market and the Investors & Exporters (I & E) window also suggests a mispricing of the currency, which makes investors and businesses reluctant to bring in capital,” Afrinvest stated. The latest report also indicated that Nigeria continued to record foreign portfolio deficit with more outflows than inflows. FPI inflows stood at N13.70 billion in July 2020 as against outflow of N20.89 billion. In June 2020, inflows had stood at N25.27 billion against outflows of N31.07 billion. Earlier, the six-month half-year report had shown that for every naira invested, foreign portfolio investors took out two naira in the first half of this year. Foreign portfolio outflows had risen to N266.68 billion in first half of 2020 as against inflows of N129.95 billion, representing a net FPI deficit of N136.7 billion. The deficits of N136.7 billion in first half 2020 represented 31.1 per cent increase on N104.29 billion recorded for the whole of 2019. Total FPIs for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020 stood at N396.63 billion. Total FPIs during the first half of 2019 had stood at N472.78 billion with outflows and inflows at N257.81 billion and N214.97 billion. Total FPIs for the seven-month period ended July 31, 2020 dropped to N431.22 billion with outflows and inflows of N287.57 billion and N143.65 billion, compared with total FPIs of N530.57 billion, including outflows and inflows of N287.22 billion and N243.35 billion, recorded in comparable period of last year. The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) reported that total capital imports dropped by 78.6 per cent (that is, $1.3 billion) in second quarter of the year, the lowest level since $1 billion posted in second quarter of 2016. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) declined by 33.4 per cent to $148.6 million in second quarter 2020 as against comparable period of 2019, this represents the lowest performance since third quarter 2017. Afrinvest attributed the sharp decline in capital importation in the second quarter of 2020 to “heightened risks brought by the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in weak sentiment in emerging markets and foreign capital outflows”. Financial Derivatives Company (FDC) also at the weekend noted that “forex shortages continue to put pressure on economic activity”. “We believe FDI weakness reflects the volatile macroeconomic environment and weak medium to long-term economic prospects. Going forward, we expect foreign investment to remain weak due to COVID-19 related risks and currency challenges,” Afrinvest stated. Most analysts expected Nigeria’s forex crisis to persist, pressuring the naira to a new devaluation. Analysts at Cordros Securities said there was still headroom for naira to depreciate further despite CBN’s efforts towards exchange rate unification. Analysts outlined that widening current account position, currency mispricing, which could induce speculative attacks on the naira, and the resumption of forex sales to the BDC segment of the market which should place an additional layer of pressure on the reserves are indicative of further depreciation in naira. Naira showed a steady performance last week on the back of improvement in foreign reserves, which rose by 0.3 per cent to $35.7 billion by the close of business on  June 26. The forex outlook was also boosted by increase in crude oil price, with Brent rising by 4.3 per cent to close weekend at $45.6 bbl. At the official I & E window, naira gained 0.1 per cent to close weekend at N385.67 per dollar. It closed flat at the parallel market at N477 per dollar. The CBN’s spot rate rallied by N2 to close at N379 per dollar. The CBN had announced the resumption of forex sales to BDCs at N384 per dollar  to increase dollar liquidity in the parallel market. The weekly sales volume per BDC is $10,000 while the BDCs are expected to sell at a ceiling of N386 per dollar. The sale is expected to take off today ahead of the resumption of international travels. “We expect the exchange rates to remain range-bound at the official market and the I & E window. However, following the intervention of the CBN at the parallel market, we expect gains for the local currency in the near term,” Afrinvest stated.
