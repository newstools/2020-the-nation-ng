Italian clubs AS Roma and Napoli have agreed a fee for the transfer of Polish forward Arkadiusz Milik, according to a report by Italian “Corriere dello Sport” newspaper. The Italian daily reports Napoli have accepted the offer from Roman club and Milik may be sold for a fee of EUR 15m . Moreover, Roma’s Turkish midfielder Cengiz Ünder would also move in the opposite direction. However, it is not certain that Milik will join Roma. The key to the deal happening now is the will of the Polish player because recently Italian media have reported that Milik really wants to join champions Juventus, even though their manager Maurizio Sarri was recently sacked. Should Milik join Roma, he would be the first incoming transfer under the club’s new owner, Dan Friedkin, an American billionaire and a film producer. Last season, the Polish forward scored 11 goals in 28 appearances in Serie A, the top Italian football division. Moreover, he added a hat-trick in the UEFA Champions League match against Belgian KRC Genk. Milik joined Napoli in 2016, the Italian’s paid EUR 32m to Dutch club Ajax.
