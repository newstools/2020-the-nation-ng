 URHOBO Progress Union (UPU) has appealed to the Federal Government to site the national headquarters of the gas flare trust fund in Urhoboland. President-General Olorogun Moses Taiga insisted the Urhobo were entitled to the headquarters of the gas flare trust fund because other states and ethnic nationalities have got ‘their fair share of Federal Government establishments’. Taiga said the facility ought to be located in Urhobo land due to the deleterious impact of gas flare on its environment. In a statement, he noted: “Urhobo Ethnic Nationality has been a host to major oil and gas assets since the discovery of petroleum in Nigeria, producing oil and gas from Afiesere, Eriemu, Osioka, Evwreni, and Oroni fields (OML 30); Ughelli North, Ughelli South, Utorogu, Effurun, Ward River and Orho I fields (OML 34); Okwefe, Amukpe, Okporhuru, and Mosogar, Ovhor and Orhogho (OML 38); Sapele, Ubaleme, Okoporo (Ugborhen/Ozue) fields (OML 41); Matsogo field (OML 56); Aroh, Okwefe, Deep and Oghareki Fields (OML 49). “Urhobo are host to some of the largest gas fields, with the Ughelli East and Utorogun Gas fields being the largest gas plants in West Africa. These fields are served by oil flow stations, pumping stations and the gas plants. “These are all sources of gas and other pollutant emissions. The Urhobo people and their environs, being upland and swamp, had more than enough share of gas flares than any other nationality in Nigeria.” He stressed the readiness of the Urhobo people to host the headquarters of the proposed body, stressing that facilities abound in Warri and environs for its take-off.
