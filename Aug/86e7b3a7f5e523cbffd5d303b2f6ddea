Bayelsa State has assured primary school teachers the Douye Diri administration will pay their salaries promptly. Deputy Governor Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo spoke when he met with chairmen, vice chairmen and other principal officers of the eight local governments. He directed officials of the State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) to liaise with the councils to remove bottlenecks causing delays in payment of teachers, a statement by his media aide, Doubara Atasi, said on Wednesday. Ewhrudjakpo said reports showed primary school teachers get their salaries one or two weeks after other council workers. He said: “I hear that primary teachers get their salaries late, usually one or two weeks after other council workers have got theirs. “I am not sure it is the fault of the chairmen because the report I have says money gets to the councils late and so the councils pay late. This is in addition to complaints from the Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT) that their general dues don’t get to them. ‘’We need to address this so that teachers can also get their salaries on time.” To check fraudulent practices, the deputy governor set up a committee, headed by the Chief of Staff, Government House, Benson Agadaga, to ascertain the grade levels and steps of  primary school workers. The committee has three weeks to submit its report. It would also scrutinise the nominal rolls and payment schedules of the eight councils.
