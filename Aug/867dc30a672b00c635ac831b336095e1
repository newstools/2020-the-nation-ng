Education stakeholders in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe have agreed to develop a 10-year strategic plan backed by law, which can effectively respond to unforeseen crises. They also agreed on the place of credible data and monitoring for such plans to work. Members of Houses of Assembly, Commissioners for Education, Permanent Secretaries and the Universal Basic Education Board said this in a communiqué at the end of a one-day high-levelled advocacy meeting on education sector plan in Maiduguri, Borno State. The meeting, which was organised by the Borno State Universal Basic Education Board, was supported by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). “States should prioritise activities in strategic and operational plans by channelling resources to areas of greatest needs within the provision of available resources. “States should garner political clout through policy dialogue to ensure ownership of education plans. “Policy makers should demand reports of the performance of education sector plans from the technical team as a tool for accountability to track progress made,’’ the stakeholders stated. Other resolutions made at the meeting include the needs to conduct annual school census and that national and global documents should guide the development of education sector plans. UNICEF Education Specialist, Dr. Rosemary Nwangwu noted the development of strategic education plans in the three north east states would enable the region transit and catch up with the standard of education obtainable in at least 30 other states in the country. According to her, a sectoral education plan will provide the states a roadmap against which progress and setbacks could be easily measured. “The development of this plan is a look-ahead for a future for children in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states using education as a tool for constructive engagement,’’ she said.
