  Senior Pastor of the Synagogue Church of All Nations, SCAON, Prophet T.B Joshua has voiced his support for the ease of the lockdown declared by the federal government. According to him, the lockdown order is an evil spirit that could lead to laziness and suicide. The cleric further calmed frayed nerves, saying that the coronavirus disease is not as dangerous as it is portrayed. Speaking on Sunday, Joshua said the government has with the lockdown directive succeeded in putting the spirit of fear, addiction and the spirit of violence in the people. “Our government doesn’t know that lockdown is a spirit, an evil spirit – spirit of laziness, spirit of depression, spirit of suicide,” he said. “Those who once surrounded themselves with people find themselves surrounded only by four empty walls. This can cause depression and suicidal thoughts. “Those who never stayed on a spot are now confined to one spot. Our government doesn’t know this. They think they are protecting us from the spirit of COVID19 but what is COVID-19 in comparison to the repercussion? “Our government, our leaders, our presidents, you are doing good for the world but what you are trying to protect us from is not as dangerous as what you are putting us into. “That spirit that has entered your life – spirit of fear, spirit of addiction, spirit of violence – be cast out! Be cast out! In the name of Jesus! The ease of the lockdown declared by President M,uhammadu Buhari will begin in Lagos, Ogun and Abuja on Monday 4th May, 2020
