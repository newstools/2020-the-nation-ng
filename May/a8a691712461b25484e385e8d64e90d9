 One person was on Friday confirmed dead and 16 others injured after a Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) tanker caught fire at Obalende, Lagos. The incident, which occurred in front of Oando Gas Station just opposite the Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) station, was said to have caused panic and heavy traffic in the area. It was gathered that the 45,000 capacity tanker, which was laden with Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) upended while negotiating a bend. The Nation reports that yesterday’s fire occurred barely four days after another tanker caught fire at an NNPC Gas Station in Ogba, Lagos, destroying no fewer than 30 vehicles. According to the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), a fire fighter was badly injured while combating the fire and had been moved to hospital for treatment.  LASEMA’s Director General, Dr. Femi Oke-Osanyintolu, said: “The agency received a distress call on the above incident concerning a 45000 litre capacity tanker loaded with PMS which was ablaze having fallen on its side directly in front of the petrol station. “Efforts to combat the flames by the agency’s officials and men of the Lagos State Fire Service and the Federal Fire Service have been successful and the fire has been extinguished. The station and surrounding buildings were protected. “Unfortunately, the inferno resulted in a single fatality, 15 minor casualties and one major casualty who happens to be a Lagos State firefighter. He has been subsequently transferred to the Lagos State General Hospital for treatment, while minor casualties received on the scene medical attention. “We appeal for calm and urge members of the public to keep away.We regret any inconvenience caused.”
