 TALENTED singer and rapper Rova Ikemefuna has featured Terry Apala on a track off his first full project titled ‘Pandemic the EP’. The collaboration is entitled ‘Make it rain’. Ikemefuna describes Terry Apala as the perfect collaborator for the three-track Extended Play (EP) saying “I am very picky with features because it is easy to water down the consciousness of a song when it’s more than one artist on it, but Terry was just perfect because he has a flavor to his vibe and he spits depth from all angles.” Rova Ikemefuna said the release of the EP was the perfect timing for artistic consciousness based on the current global pandemic that has made him reflect on a lot of things. The former Agro export consultant who quit his job in 2018 to focus solely on music describes his latest EP and kind of sound as a sound everyone can relate with. “The pandemic EP is the kinda sound that the everyday hustler, bro or girl can relate to and vibe with, it also talks about socio-economic issues so I advise everyone to listen and enjoy my school of thought. I vibe to anything; Hip-hop Soul, RnB, reggae, Afrobeats, dancehall. I like to create music in my way. So I’ll call my genre Rova Music. Rova was coined from Rover, which a sports player that can play in any part of the field” The project which according to the singer was inspired by the state of the economy and behavioral patterns and was produced by Mr Marz and Klef, Mixed and mastered by Blazer & Badass.
