 A rape victim identified simply as Sade, is in for a  fresh trouble as she has been asked to choose between making  certain rituals  to appease the gods of the land and live or lose her life  if she fails to do so. The victim was reportedly raped by a commercial motorcyclist known as Laolu Omogunwa at Ago Akingboye in Irele Local Government Area of Ondo State. Sade who was pregnant before the incident lost the pregnancy thereafter. Traditional ruler of the community, the Ahaba of Ajagba, Oba Adesayo Ajibade said it is a taboo to have sex with women on bare ground in Ikale land. According to the royal father, ‘the consequence of such desecration of the custom of the town is poor yields and famine unless the offenders appease the gods of the land.”  He said the raped woman might not survive any sickness without the rituals.  Sade, aged 30, reportedly hired Laolu to take her to a farm settlement to buy some kegs of palm oil.  She said Laolu took another route on the pretense that she would get palm oil to buy at cheaper price in the area. Sade narrated amidst tears that the suspect drove her into a lonely bush and later attacked her.  She stated that Laolu strangled her, dispossessed her of her phone and the sum of N150,000 after which he raped her until she became unconscious. The victim who lost her pregnancy after the rape said the suspect almost raped her to death before leaving for dead.  She said: I regained consciousness after y a heavy rainfall having being unconscious for several hours. It was a search party organised by the family that rescued me  where I was  struggling to crawl to the road.” She said it took her about 48 hours to regain consciousness after losing the pregnancy as a result of excessive bleeding.
