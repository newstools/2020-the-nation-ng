Anthony Joshua’s world heavyweight title clash with Kubrat Pulev could take place in a Roman amphitheatre in Croatia after the challenger’s team pitched the location. Joshua’s first defence after regaining the IBF, WBA and WBO belts from Andy Ruiz Jr was scheduled to take place at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in June but it was scuppered by the coronavirus pandemic.  They now need a new location and while Saudi Arabia and other nations have spoken about hosting Joshua’s planned bout with Tyson Fury, promoter Eddie Hearn admitted negotiations were not underway. Pulev still holds the contractual right to be the next challenger and his manager has now revealed they have pitched the Pula Arena as a venue.
