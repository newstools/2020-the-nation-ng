The Abia State Government has declared one Mr. Emmanuel Ononiwu wanted after testing positive for COVID-19. Ononiwu was said to have refused to submit himself for appropriate medical management and isolating himself. A release by the Abia State Commissioner of Information, Chief John Okiyi-Kalu on Thursday said that Ononiwu, a resident of Aba, the commercial nerve centre of the state escaped from a temporary holding facility in Aba prior to his movement to an isolation centre after being informed of his COVID-19 status. All subsequent appeals made to him through his phone line; 08033484117, fell on deaf ears as he insisted that he will not turn himself in and has gone ahead to switch off his line along with that of his spouse who is also required to come in immediately for testing. Okiyi-Kalu stated that the last tracked location of Ononiwu was around Asa Triangle in Aba South LGA. “If seen anywhere, please report to the nearest security agency or call 0700 2242 362, but do not approach him without full protection to avoid infection. “Enforcement teams all over the state are also advised to be on the look out and take him in as soon as he is found. “All those who had contact with him in the past 14 days are strongly advised to call 0700 2242 362 and submit themselves for testing. “We strongly advise all citizens and residents to be vigilant and take necessary measures to protect themselves. “Do not leave your house without wearing your face mask appropriately and ensure you maintain social distance at all times. “COVID-19 is real and if we take responsibility as individuals we can win the battle against the virus in our state and country.”
