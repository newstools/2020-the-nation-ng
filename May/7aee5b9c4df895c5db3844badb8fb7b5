Shareholders of FCMB Group Plc have applauded the financial institution for its resilience, dynamism and impressive performance recorded last year despite the challenging operating environment. The shareholders, who gave the commendation at the seventh Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the group in Lagos, approved the payment of a cash dividend of 14 kobo per ordinary share, which translates to N2.77 billion, for the year ended December 31, 2019. The AGM was held by proxy, following the outbreak of the COVID-19 (novel coronavirus) pandemic, and streamed live to shareholders of the financial institution who were unable to physically attend due to the lockdown imposed by the Government.
