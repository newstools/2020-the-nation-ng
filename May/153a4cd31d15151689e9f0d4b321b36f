 NO other set of eye accessories have captured the imagination of fashion buffs this season like sunglasses. Stylish sunglasses are in vogue. They are all so noticeable and add a subtle and sex appeal to one’s look. Sunglasses come in different patterns and designs, depending on the style. Go for those  that complement your frame. Your choice of sunglasses should be influenced by the shape of your head, the type of your dress (whether official or casual) and the colour of your dress. Classic and beautiful sunglasses definitely make you put others in the shade.
