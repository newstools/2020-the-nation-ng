 THE Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Anambra State chapter, has cried out over what it described as the ‘distribution’ of almajiri from Kano State to parts of the country. It demanded evidential and admissible reasons to justify the movement of such persons it alleged were Coronavirus carriers in view of its health and security implications on the recipient states. In a statement yesterday by its Chairman, Rev. Dr. Ndubuisi John, CAN wondered if the move was another way of decongesting the Coronavirus from suffocating its orbits. The statement reads:  “Inasmuch as we commiserate with Kano State over the loss of their loved ones to mysterious deaths and Covid-19, we still want to know what in the world can be the cogent excuse from the state to permit trailers loaded with human beings, many of them Coronavirus carriers, to leave Kano boundaries and cross over sister states to penetrate their cities. “Could this be a palliative measure to decongest the Coronavirus from suffocating its orbits?”
