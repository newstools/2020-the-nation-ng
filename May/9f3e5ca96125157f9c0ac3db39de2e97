A statement by the company’s Chief Executive Office, Frank Ewuzie, explained the empowerment programme is to encourage the youths. “It’s going to be one stage crown but three winners,” said Ewuzie. “There are many opportunities because we have been supported by multinational companies. “The second prize and third prize goes home with N500,000 with a multinational job offer and N250,000 with a multinational job offer and other undisclosed opportunities that will encourage the youth of this country.” The online edition will start in September, 2020.
