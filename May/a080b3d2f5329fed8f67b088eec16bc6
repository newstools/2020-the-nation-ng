The Lagos Lawn Tennis Club has donated the sum of N5milllion to the Lagos State government towards the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. Presenting the cheque to Kola Peregrino in Ikeja, GM, Lagos State Printing Corporation, who stood in for the Lagos State government, president of the club, Ademola Akin-Taylor said the cheque is the club’s widow’s might/contribution towards state’s battle against the rampaging Covid-19. “We are very impressed with Lagos State and the governor, who is one of our patrons; so automatically, we have to support him in his fight against the virus,” Akin-Taylor said. He added that the club considered the gesture more pertinent because the state, as its host, has always supported it, especially by staging its annual Governor’s Cup tennis tournament in its facility. Akin-Taylor, who said the government is free to use the fund in whatever way it deems necessary in the ongoing battle,  advised the people to support the government’s effort by “maintaining social distancing, wearing face mask always and washing their hands all the time.” A member ofthe club’s Covid-19 fundraising committee, Gboyega Marinho commended members for their generosity. “It was a wonderful job by all members of the club, who contributed from N5000, to N10,000, to N200,000 to N1million to ensure that the sum of N5million was realised.”
