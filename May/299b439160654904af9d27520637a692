The Onimeiran of Meiran Kingdom in the Agbado/Oke-Odo LCDA of Lagos State, Oba (Dr.) Awoyemi Oroja, has stressed that the Lagos State government’s engagement of the people on advocacy and sensitisation on the ravaging coronavirus pandemic has helped in educating them on how to prevent contacting the disease. Oba Oroja, who made this remark in a statement at his Meiran palace, said that the people were quite happy that in spite of the frightening rising figure in cases, the government has through its response strategy raised the hope of the citizens in winning the fight against the pandemic. He particularly commended the state governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, for the various measures being put in place to contain the spread of the disease. Onimeiran also thanked the Iyaloja-in-General of Nigeria, Chief (Mrs) Folashade Ojo, for the palliatives she distributed across the state to cushion the effects of the lockdown on the people. While expressing his happiness at the government’s readiness to fight the disease to a standstill in the state, Oba Oroja stressed that he and his chiefs had carried out research on the cure and prevention of the ravaging coronavirus pandemic. The monarch, who noted with delight the state government’s fumigation of the nooks and crannies of major public places in the state, however, attributed the government’s successful efforts to the governor’s ability to put in place robust emergency response measures. He, therefore, urged the people to remain vigilant, disciplined and obey all precautionary measures released by the government to end the pandemic such as avoiding crowded locations, staying at home, observing social and physical distancing and respiratory hygiene.
