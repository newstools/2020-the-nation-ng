About 40 cases involving domestic and sexual violence, sexual abuse of minors, rape, incest, sodomy, are presently under investigation, the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), has said. The agency said these cases were recorded during the five weeks lockdown ordered by President Muhammadu Buhari. NAPTIP noted that some persons took advantage of the period to unleash violence on their loved ones who are mostly women. The agency also said that over 400 persons have been prosecuted for human trafficking. Director-General of NAPTIP, Julie Okah-Donli disclosed this at the commissioning of a water project donated by ex-beauty queen and founder, African Scholars Care Initiative (ASCI), Joy Onumajuru-Osomiamhe, to the LEA primary school in Jahi 1, Abuja. She warned that the agency would not hesitate to invoke the relevant laws to deal with anyone found to be disturbing the peace of the nation at this period.
