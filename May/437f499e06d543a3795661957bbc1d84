Shanghai Shenhua are reportedly happy to allow Odion Ighalo to remain at Manchester United until January… but only if he signs a new two-year deal with them. Ighalo arrived at Old Trafford on a short-term loan deal in January, and despite the season not yet finishing due to the coronavirus, his contract is due to expire on Sunday. Talks are ongoing over whether he will remain in England or leave to head back to China, but Sky Sports are reporting that his parent club have come up with a solution. It has been reported that Shanghai Shenhua will allow Ighalo’s loan deal to be extended as far as January, but only if the player ties down his future in China until 2024 in a deal worth £400,000 a week. The striker is currently under contract until 2022 in Shanghai but the club are desperate to top his deal up with a further two years before they allow him to stay – and potentially impress – in the Premier League. Ighalo has only started three games for United – making a further five appearances off the bench – but already has four goals to his name. With his contract currently ending this weekend, there is some confusion over where he goes next, with reports earlier in the week claiming he would be unable to return to China until October. It was stated that travel restrictions on foreigners returning to China – which includes around a third of Chinese Super League footballers – could remain in place for months to come, despite the new season starting in June. Shanghai Shenhua are believed to be ready to bring in a short-term replacement for Ighalo should he not be able to return, giving Manchester United a boost in their attacking department for the coming months.
