 The Federal Government has suspended further evacuation of stranded Nigerians overseas. The development, according to Foreign Affairs Minister Geoffrey Onyeama is to allow take-off of a new policy on evacuation of Nigerians. Onyeama said henceforth evacuated Nigerians would not have to go straight into 14-day government monitored isolation if they test negative from their country of origin. The Minister said the new policy will take effect from next week. Consequently, he said further evacuation process has been suspended to give way for the take- off of the new policy. He said with the new policy evacuees will have to be tested at most nine days before their flight take off. He said those who test positive will not be allowed on the flight The new policy, he said will give the government enough latitude to fly more Nigerians home. Nigeria has evacuated 989 stranded citizens with 265 from United Arab Emirates; United Kingdom (253); United States (160); Saudi Arabia (292) and Lebanon (57)  Details shortlyâ€¦
