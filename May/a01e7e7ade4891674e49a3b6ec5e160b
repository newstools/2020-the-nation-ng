 For months now, many have been wondering about the relationship between Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State and his deputy, Agboola Ajayi, amidst claims that the duo canâ€™t work together. While the uncertainties about their relationship rage, with their allies and supporters clashing openly on some occasions, neither Akeredolu, nor Ajayi has confirmed the alleged cracks on the wall of their joint ticket. On many occasions, the duo came out to tell the world that all was well between them. But keen observers of the politics of the state claimed their statements were mere attempts to manage a deepening crisis. Stories of how some concerned stakeholders within and outside the state tried to reconcile the duo also flew around with most attempts ending in deadlock according to tale-bearers. Two weeks ago, very strong indications emerged that Ajayi may be dropped as deputy governorship candidate in the July governorship election, just as it was strongly bandied that the embattled deputy governor may have struck a deal with the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, (PDP) on his possible defection to the party to pick the governorship ticket. Now, it appears that the dispute between the two men may have been settled. Sentry learnt that some prominent traditional rulers and eminent personalities from the Ondo South senatorial district, in a last minute effort to save the situation, may have succeeded in settling the grouses between the duo. As things stand, the dust may have settled. Whether it is so or not, events of the next few weeks will reveal.
