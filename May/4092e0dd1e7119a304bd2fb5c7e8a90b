Prominent Bayelsa political leaders and elders have called on the people of Sagbama and Ekeremor to give the requisite support to the former governor of Bayelsa State, Honourable Henry Seriake Dickson in the bid for the Bayelsa West Senatorial slot in the National Assembly. The elders agreed with unanimity that Hon Dickson was the best candidate for the senatorial slot and should be supported by all to fill the vacant position. “The senate is the highest law-making body in Nigeria, therefore you need a man like the Honourable Henry Dickson who understands the politics of the country, who has a vast knowledge in law making having served as a member of the House of Representatives. He is more qualified than any other politician from the Bayelsa West Senatorial District with his capacity for networking and vast contacts. “He has made his marks in governance and has proved to be a tested leader with incontrovertible interest in the development of our society. “He has the experience and the capacity to articulate the issues affecting Bayelsa, the Ijaw nation the Niger Delta and Nigeria. He has done it before and is trusted to do it again. “We call on all to mobilize support to achieve the desire of the Bayelsa West people for effective representation at the Senate. “We thank all those who have endorsed him for being on the favored side of history. As soon as this Coronavirus saga is over, we would embark on massive mobilization in the pursuit of the collective will of our people. “It is stating the obvious that he is the best for Bayelsa West, Bayelsa, the Ijaw Nation, the Niger Delta and Nigeria.” The statement added
