The Change Africa Foundation, an empowerment organisation, has donated relief materials to support governments in the fight against Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The materials included bags of beans, garri, onions, kegs of groundnut oil, cartons of chicken, baskets of pepper, tomato, spices and data subscription vouchers. They were donated to four orphanage homes, including Lekki Motherless Babies Home, Sought After Orphanage Home, Olive Bloom Orphanage Home, Peculiar Saints Orphanage Home. All benefiting homes are domiciled in Lagos, the epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic. President, Change Africa Foundation, Olamide Olabisi said the foundation has over the years done its  work around catering to the less privileged. According to him, in the last seven years, the foundation has provided support through her various initiatives for some orphanage homes across Lagos, with some of the previous beneficiaries, including Love Home Orphanage, Heritage Orphanage Home, Optimal Orphanage Home and Life Fountain Orphanage Home in Lagos. “We have had a deep sense of responsibility for orphanage homes in Lagos, through our Konamii initiative. So far, we have utilised our network, resources and innovation to raise funds and support for over seven orphanages in Lagos State,” Olabisi said. He noted that the pandemic has motivated the foundation to take greater action to deliver on its primary vision, as seen with its donations. He said the body would continue to be the primary institution in Nigeria, proffering, advocating and utilising resources to provide lasting solutions to the challenges that orphanage homes face. He explained that Change Africa Foundation’s focus areas include Education and metropolitan opportunity, youth and social development and Africa health.
