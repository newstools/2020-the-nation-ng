 To cushion the impact of coronavirus pandemic on economy in Nigeria, a financial controller with Sunlight Resources Limited, manufacturer of cheese balls, cornflakes, choco champs etc, Effiong James, has impressed on federal government the need to do sectoral allocation of funds for manufacturing companies across the country. James stated this in Lagos during the company’s presentation of 1000 cartons of its products, as palliative to the state government. The financial expert noted that scarcity of forex and infrastructural constraints exacerbate cost of production in Nigeria, which according to him, government needs to curtail.  “We are here to support the government of Lagos state in providing our own support in form of palliative. We discovered that the COVID -19 lockdown has been a very challenging time for the poor and we also discovered that Lagos state government has been doing a lot in alleviating the suffering of the masses by providing palliative and that is why we decided to contribute our own quota by presenting 1000 cartons our own products” While receiving the products on behalf of Lagos state government, the state commissioner for Agriculture, Hon. Gbolahan Lawal, expressed gratitude to the donor for their good gesture, saying the role of private sector is crucial to stop COVID-19 in Nigeria.
