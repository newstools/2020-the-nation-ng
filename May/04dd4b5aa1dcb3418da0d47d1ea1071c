 The State Chairman of the All Progressive Congress APC in Cross River State, Sir John Ochalla has dismissed as tissues of lies, a statement from one Ekpenyong Effiom Asuquo, JP, the Secretary of PDP Youth Forum wherein he stated that “Governor Ben Ayade has been funding the APC ever since”. Ochalla in a press statement made available to newsmen on Monday called the attention of the General Public saying he would have ordinarily ignored the write up from one Ekpenyong Effiom Asuquo, JP, secretary to a youth forum in PDP, but the times we are in now politically are very interesting and I will not let this opportunity pass by without keeping the records straight. He said the controversial statement from a Youth Forum of the PDP, in paragraph seven, stated that ” Ayade has been funding the APC ever since. This statement is not only a tissue of lies but a figment of the author’s imagination.” His words, “to the best of my knowledge, Governor Ayade has not funded the APC with a kobo at any level, rather the PDP and Governor Ayade tried and are still trying to sow seeds of discord within the APC but thank God majority of our people are wise enough to see through their antics.” “The PDP should not drag the APC into their internal crisis. Let the PDP dance her strip dance in shame. All their evil plans against the APC have boomeranged”. “The APC Cross River State is re-engineering with absolute resolve to key Cross River State into the Progressive family and save our people from a confused, clueless, and visionless PDP administration in the State.” “I advise the PDP government in Cross River to focus their energies on educating our people on how to contain the Covid-19 pandemic and provide palliative to Cross Riverians in these difficult times.” “Our doors remain open to all those who are ready to jump out of the PDP Sinking Ship into the Progressive APC Family.”
