Two men, Pastor John Abiodun and a lecturer in Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba-Akoko, have been charged with planting a placenta on the altar of a church in Akure, the Ondo State capital. They were earlier arraigned for conspiring to publish life-threatening rumours, false and inciting stories about one Ajidahun Emmanuel Jeminiyi and Pastor Gbenga Akinbiyi on various social media platforms. On amendment, the suspects are now charged with planting a placenta at a church. Justice Bode Adegbehinge adjourned the case to May 14th.
