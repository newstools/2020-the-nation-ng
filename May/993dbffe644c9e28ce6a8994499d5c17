A man, Endurance Eshegbai, has allegedly killed his cousin, Usman Abdul-Lateef, over a N2 million land deal in Edo State. Abdul-Lateef, who hails from Akpekpe Quarters in Auchi, headquarters of Etsako West Local Government Area of Edo state, was declared missing on May 13. Police arrested Eshegbai, who allegedly confessed to the crime. The decomposing body of Abdul-Lateef, buried in a shallow grave in the bush, was exhumed and reburied at 7:10 p.m. on May 19, according to Islamic rites. Sources close to Abdul-Lateef said the deceased left home with Eshegbai on May 13 for a bank transaction, but he (Abdul-Lateef) never returned. Eshegbai was arrested but was later released. Members of Abdul-Lateef’s family contacted the manager of Auchi branch of GTB to monitor the deceased’s account. The suspect, who was in possession of the ATM card and PIN of Abdul-Lateef, came on May 19 to the same Auchi branch of GTB to withdraw some money from the deceased’s account, and was immediately arrested. Police spokesman Chidi Nwabuzor could not be reached, but a senior police officer, who spoke in confidence, said the suspect would soon be charged to court for murder.
