 No fewer than 643 Departmental Staff of the University of Ilorin (UNILORIN) have received food items donated by the Kwara State government as palliatives to cushion the effect of the lockdown occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic. The food items, which included 200 bags of 5kg Rice, 100 bags of 10kg Garri and 50 bags of 5kg Sugar, were distributed last week. The Deputy Registrar, General Services, UNILORIN, Mrs. Maymunat Zakariyya, who was charged with the distribution, said the donation was in response to the institution’s request for support. “The Management of the University of Ilorin headed by the Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Sulyman Age Abdulkareem had, in its letter of commiseration with the Kwara State government on the Global COVID-19 pandemic, requested the state government to kindly extend the distribution of the Federal Government palliatives to its low cadre staff to ease their economic situation in this period of the lockdown. The state government responded by presenting 200 bags of 5kg Rice, 100 bags of 10kg  Garri and 50 bags of 5kg Sugar to the university administration,” she said.  She said the beneficiaries were workers on CONTISS 1 and 2, and departmental staff of the university identified as the most vulnerable. Mrs. Zakariyya expressed her appreciation to the staff of the Bursary Stores who ensured the distribution was seamless. One of the beneficiaries, Mr. Ajadi Suleiman, praised the government and the university management for the food items and admonished the beneficiaries to accept it with joy. “What the government has done is a good thing. We should all receive whatever gets to us with joy and happiness as it will do us a lot of good”. The Assistant Registrar, General Services Office, Mrs. Helen Olubiyo; Supervisor, Mr. J. J. Bello; and the Assistant Supervisor, Mr. Tunde Balogun were present at the event.
