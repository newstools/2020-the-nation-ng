 LAGOS State House of Assembly on Monday at plenary passed the Lagos State Neighbourhood Safety Corps Agency Law (amendment) 2019 bill. It made provision for the creation of an Amotekun Corps into Law. In the amendments, Section 20 (1), which subjects the appointment of the Lagos Amotekun Corps Commander to the confirmation of the House, was retained. This is in accordance with the practice and procedures of the House that sensitive appointments must be subjected to the confirmation of the House and the need to ensure that the Amotekun Corps Commander appointment is properly scrutinised. Section 20(3) of the amendment bill, which subjects the removal of the Lagos Amotekun Corps Commander to the concurrence of the House, was deleted, as the committee agreed that there should be a line of discipline in accordance with public service establishment and engagement. After voice votes in favour of the amendments, Speaker Mudashiru Obasa directed Mr. Azeez Sanni, the Clerk, to forward a clean copy of the bill to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu for his assent. Although the House passed the bill a few weeks ago, the governor returned it for amendments to some sections, which delayed his assent to the bill. The suggested amendments were what the House worked on and passed on Monday.
