Veteran Nigerian coach, Kadiri Ikhana says he’s recovering very fast from the spinal cord injury that kept him on a spot. Ikhana says he can walk and drive himself around adding that the doctor told him that he will soon be fully fit. “I’m much better now and if you see me you will be surprised yourself and it’s a matter of time, I’ve been told by my doctor that getting very fit will take a little time, it has to be gradual.” Ikhana said. The former Enyimba, Kano Pillars and Sunshine Stars coach stated that he visited the Alliance Hospital in March for another surgery and will still be in Abuja in November for the last spinal cord surgery. “As a matter of fact, I went to Abuja on the 22nd of March and the two surgeries are healing very fast, I will wait for six months before going for my last surgery which is on spinal cord. “Now, I’m very okay, I walk around, I drive my car without stick or stress and I’m better, thank God.” He concluded.
