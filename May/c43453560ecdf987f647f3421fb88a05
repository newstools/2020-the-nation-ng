A woman accused of posing as a doctor in a German hospital has been charged with murder following several deaths, a prosecution official said on Monday. The 49-year-old suspect is accused of five counts of murder and 11 counts of grievous bodily harm, according to a spokesman for the state prosecution service in Kassel, in central Germany. The woman worked at the hospital in the town of Fritzlar from 2015 to 2018. According to the indictment, she used forged documents to get a position there as an assistant doctor in anaesthesia, inspite of not having the necessary training. Several patients were treated wrongly, for example being given the incorrect dose of anaesthetic. Five people, two men aged 58 and 80, and three women aged 77, 81 and 86 are said to have died as a result. (dpa/NAN)
