The Enugu State government, in furtherance of its efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus in the state on Friday, launched the distribution of one million units of fabric face masks to its residents across the 17 local government areas for protection free of charge. The face masks were produced by the state government using fabrics supplied and sewed by indigenous traders and trained tailors respectively as a means of socio-economic empowerment. Consequently, it is expected that over 30,000 youths will be empowered through the production of the face masks. Presenting the items to the public, the Deputy Governor of Enugu State, Hon.
