Two employees of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) were at the weekend arrested by the police for allegedly stealing sensitive documents belonging to the commission. They were reportedly caught red-handed moving the documents out of the commission’s headquarters in Port Harcourt, Rivers State capital. It was gathered that the two suspects were apprehended by the Executive Director, Finance and Administration and the Executive Director, Project. The two suspects, whose identities were still kept under wraps, were reportedly taken to the Police Station at Olu Obasanjo for further investigations and prosecution. A source from the commission, who spoke in confidence said one of the suspects came from the Delta State’s office of the commission while the second employee worked at the commission’s headquarters. The source said: “The two directors made a surprise visit to the commission’s headquarters on Saturday. They met some employees and demanded to know what they were doing at the office. They got satisfactory answers from them. “They headed for the third floor of the headquarters and saw two employees coming out of the building and demanded to know their mission. But they could not explain what they were doing at the building. “One of the directors opted to search their bag and discovered many sensitive documents belonging to the commission. One of the employees came from our Delta State office while the other one works in the head office. They were immediately handed over to the police.” He said the suspects worked at the Human Resources Department of the commission.
