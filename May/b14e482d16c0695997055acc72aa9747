Twenty-nine commercial motorcycle operators heading to Lagos have been intercepted in Abuja by a ministerial enforcement team on Covid-19 movement restrictions. The men were said to be traveling on a truck from Lafia, the Nasarawa State capital, enroute Lagos before they were arrested on Tuesday at the Aya Bridge in Asokoro District of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The driver, Samaila Samiya, said the truck carrying fine stones used for making marbles and tiles was loaded in Taraba State and heading to Lagos, but that on getting to Lafia, he picked up the okada riders who pleaded to pay N2,000 to get to Lagos. One of the passengers, Musa Simon said they are commercial motorcycle operators who left Lagos in the wake of the Covid-19 lockdown and were returning to resume work following threats by the motorcycle owners that they would sell off their motorcycles should they fail to return. Addressing journalists at the Eagle Square where those arrested were arraigned before a mobile court, chairman of the Task force team, Ikharo Attah, lamented that “despite the series of arrests, prosecutions and turning back of violators by the FCT Administration, many persons are yet to fully comply with the Presidential directive on inter-state travel ban. “Just when one feels there is enough arrest to deter people, many more would continue to move and traverse state borders.”
