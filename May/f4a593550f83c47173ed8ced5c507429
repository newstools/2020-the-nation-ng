Despite the strong caution by the Presidenial Task Force (PTF) and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), some governors decided to unlock all mosques and churches at a time coronavirus infection was fast spreading. Investigation revealed that the governors chose the deadly option because of political ambition and they do not want to offend both the crescent and the cross. This has demonstrated the role religion is playing in Nigerian politics. A governor said: “In the North here, you offend the Ulamas at your own political peril.”
