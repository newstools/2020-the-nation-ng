Osagie Otabor, Akure  A pregnant woman identified as Sade Jawo who was raped by a commercial motorcyclist known as Laolu Omogunwa is on the verge of losing her life if certain rituals were not performed. This is because it is a taboo in Ikale land to have sex on the bare ground in the bush. The incident was said to have taken place at Ago Akingboye in Irele Local Government Area of Ondo State. Sade, aged 30, reportedly hired Laolu to take her to a farm settlement to buy some kegs of palm oil. She said Laolu took another route on the pretence that she would get palm oil to buy at a cheap price in the area. Sade narrated amidst tears that the suspect drove her into a lonely bush and later attacked her. She stated that Laolu strangled her, dispossessed her of her phone and the sum of N150,000 after which he raped her until she became unconscious. The victim who lost her pregnancy after the rape said the suspect almost raped her to death before leaving. She said she was revived by heavy rain after being unconscious for several hours. It was a search party organised by the family that rescued her where she was seen struggling to crawl to the road. She said it took her about 48 hours to regain consciousness after losing the pregnancy as a result of excessive bleeding. Traditional ruler of the community, the Ahaba of Ajagba, Oba Adesayo Ajibade said it is a taboo to have sex with women on bare ground in Ikale land. According to the royal father, â€˜the consequence of such desecration of the custom of the town is poor yields and famine unless the offenders appease the gods of the land. He said the raped woman who has lost her pregnancy might not survive any sickness without the rituals.
