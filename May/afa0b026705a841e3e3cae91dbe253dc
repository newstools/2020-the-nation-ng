 Nigerian equities halted their month-long rally with a 44 per cent decline in turnover as investors appeared to take a pause on global stocks. Nigerian equities closed weekend with average decline of 0.72 per cent, equivalent to net capital depreciation of N90 billion. Nigerian stock market performance trailed global equities indices with declines across major advanced and emerging economies. United States of America’s Dow Jones Industrial Average and S & P 500 closed weekend with average decline of 2.9 per cent and 2.6 per cent respectively. United Kingdom’s FTSE 100 Index dropped by 2.4 per cent. The MSCI EM Index- which tracks emerging markets stocks, declined by 2.3 per cent while the MSCI FM Index- which tracks frontier markets stocks, posted average loss of 2.3 per cent. Most analysts were less optimistic about the outlook for the stock market citing the emerging disruptions by COVID-19 pandemic and global economic challenges. Analysts at Cordros Securities said increasing cases of COVID-19 and Nigeria’s weak economic conditions are major risks that could influence Nigerian stock market performance in the months ahead, urging investors to take cautious approach. “Thus, we continue to advise investors to trade cautiously and seek trading opportunities in only fundamentally justified stocks,” Cordros Securities stated. Market Analyst at FXTM, Han Tan at the weekend said markets were taking stock of their exposure to risk while mulling the protracted and arduous recovery that awaits the global economy. “The coming months remain paved with downside risks and the threat of chilling US-China relations amid this global pandemic will only further inhibit global risk appetite,” Tan stated. The All Share Index (ASI)- the value-based common index that tracks share prices at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), closed weekend at 23,871.33 points as against its opening index of 24,045.40 points for the week. With this, the average year-to-date return stood at -11.07 per cent.

Aggregate market value of all quoted equities at the NSE dropped from the week’s opening value of N12.531 trillion to close at N12.441 trillion, representing a drop of N90 billion.

Reviewing the global outlook for equities, Tan at the weekend stated that the global economy is on a long road to “new normal”, a reference to adjustments in the post-COVID-19 period. According to Tan, the data from United States and China should quell any notion of a V-shaped recovery for the rest of the world, much to the chagrin of stock market bulls.
