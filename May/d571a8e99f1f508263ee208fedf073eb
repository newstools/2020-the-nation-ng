German third division side Chemnitz on Monday confirmed that a player has tested positive for the coronavirus. All players were tested on Thursday and returned negative, but a second round of testing on Saturday produced one positive. The player who tested positive will enter 14-day quarantine at home, according to a club spokesperson. Two further people will also enter quarantine despite testing negative as they had close contact with the player. Chemnitz is fighting relegation to the fourth-tier of German football and has spoken out in favour of the third division resuming from suspension. The German football federation (DFB) which is responsible for the league said last week that the intended restart date of May 26 could not be met. It is unclear when the league will resume, but it seems certain matches would continue into July, posing a problem for players whose contracts expire at the end of June. The top two divisions in Germany, run by the German football league (DFL) resumed at the weekend. Dynamo Dresdenâ€™s second division match with Hanover, however, did not take place with the team quarantined following a number of positive tests at the club. (dpa/NAN)
