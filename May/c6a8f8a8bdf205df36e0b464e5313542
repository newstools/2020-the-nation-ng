Nura Manu Soro, has disbursed N17, 933, 449 million scholarship fund to 4, 000 students studying in 54 institutions across the nation. The beneficiaries, who are students of Bauchi state origin, were selected from islamiyya schools, primary schools, secondary schools, higher islamic schools and tertiary institutions. Member of the executive committee of the foundation Malam Mukhtar Jarmajo, who disclosed this to newsmen in Bauchi, the state capital, said the students applied for the scholarship and successfully passed the screening exercise. According to him, the scholarship, which is purely for tuition fees, is meant for students that secured admissions into the institutions but cannot pay registration fees and those who are already in schools. “Both applications, selections and verification are being carried out through a local committee. “At the tertiary level, it includes students, religious leaders and a representative from students affairs office. While at the basic education level it made up of headmaster, PTA chairman and the child parent”. “Further verification are carried out at the foundation secretariat. The foundation makes payments directly to schools accounts and not individuals,” he said.
