A Lagos lawyer, Yinka Campbell, has debunked a report accusing him of sponsoring the military and thugs to demolish buildings at Aboru, in Alimosho Local Government Area of Lagos. A national daily last Monday fingered Campbell as the alleged sponsor of four Air Force men and thugs, who carried out the destruction. The report claimed that while the lawyer denied responsibility for the demolition, he admitted supporting the invaders’ action, because his firm had been granted possession of the land. But Campbell, in a statement, said the national daily was misled and misinformed by the real land grabbers, who had been sponsoring hoodlums and law enforcement agents to demolish his clients’ building on the land. Explaining his part in the dispute, the lawyer said his firm received 17 acres of land in Aboru Village, in lieu of cash payment from his clients for handling a suit marked FHC/L/CS/629/98. The suit, he said, set aside acquisition of the said land by the Federal Government of Nigeria. His clients in the matter, he added, were Chief Salawu Bamgbopa; Rasaki Akinde; Nojimu Alade Akinola; Akeem Akinola and Akanni Sanni among others. According to him, a visit to the land and enquiry from the Community Development Association (CDA) and other genuine landlords who are his client’s vendees (buyers) would have helped to set the records straight. To prove his claim, Campbell provided three court judgments with suit numbers: FHC/L/CS/629/98; FHC/L/CS/261/2010; ID/1304/LMW/17.
