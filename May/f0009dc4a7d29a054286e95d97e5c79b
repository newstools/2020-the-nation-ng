National Coordinator of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, Aliyu Sani, has said 10 per cent of people infected with the Coronavirus are health workers. He made this known when the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) provided medical equipment to the police to curtail the spread of COVID-19 at the Force Headquarters in Abuja on Thursday. Sani, who lauded health workers for their commitment to the fight against the virus, called on other agencies to emulate NHIS so as to fight the spread of the virus. Executive Secretary of NHIS Prof Mohammed Sambo, who said the NHIS has a long-standing relationship with the Nigerian police, called for multi-sectoral cooperation to tackle the problem. Receiving the equipment the Inspector General of Police, IGP Mohammed Adamu who was represented by an Assistant Inspector General of Police Austin Agbonlahor, commended NHIS for the gesture and assured that there will be put to good use.
