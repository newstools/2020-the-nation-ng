For the dedication he put into his craft and for being an outstanding youth, celebrated Nigerian filmmaker, Eddy Young has been honoured by none other than the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, Ojaja II. Young joined a number of young Nigerians who were decorated by the monarch for their exemplary service to the nation and for being a good example in different sectors of the economy. Still basking in the euphoria of the recognition, Young stated that it is always a good feeling when the hard work that he puts into his craft is recognised. He went further saying filmmaking is not just a job, but a mission to impact lives and make a change in society by telling compelling stories. “It was a very fulfilling experience being awarded by the Ooni of Ife, Oba Ogunwusi. It was amazing to note that the palace of Ife would recognise a Benin-born filmmaker. I must say that it was an overwhelming feeling really which makes all the effort I put into my craft worth it,” he said. At an event hosted by the Royal African Young Leadership Forum of the palace of the Ooni, the traditional leader addressed all the awardees and assured them of his support and willingness to support all the selected awardees for as long as he is King. Other recipients of the awards include Yomi Casual, Kenny Black, Woli Arole, Seyi Awolowo, and a host of other young Nigerians. Last year, the filmmaker made his debut feature production, ‘Kasanova’, a comedy-laced movie which stars big names in the Nigerian movie industry. He has also defied the raging COVID-19 to release a web series titled ‘The Badchelors.’
