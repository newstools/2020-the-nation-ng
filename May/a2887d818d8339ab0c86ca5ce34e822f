 PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari has described the late President Umaru Musa-Yar’adua as a honest and sincere public servant. Buhari, in his message to commemorate the 10th year remembrance anniversary of the former President’s death, also described him as a patriot, whose primary focus as a leader was easing the pains of ordinary Nigerians. According to President Buhari, the political differences he had with the late President Musa-Ya’adua notwithstanding, he would always give him his regards as an outstanding leader in the history of Nigeria. While extending his prayers to the family of the late President and the government of Katsina State, he urged all Nigerian politicians to emulate his rare gentle nature and avert character features that would corrupt political opposition, making enemies out of political opponents. Former President Goodluck Jonathan on Tuesday described his late boss, Umaru Musa Yar’Adua, as a president like no other who lived and died for the sake of the country. The one-time Katsina State governor was described by many as the best leader of Nigeria since the return to multi-party democracy in 1999. He was the second civilian president under Nigeria’s current constitution. Yar’Adua assumed office in 2007 and led for three years. He died at 58 in Saudi Arabia in 2010 (10 years ago) and was flown back for burial. His known cause of death was said to be pericarditis – inflammation of a membrane around the heart. Yar’Adu was succeeded by the then Vice-President, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. Jonathan, who completed Yar’Adua’s tenure and won a substantive term in 2011, was among the first to post a message of remembrance of his former boss on his Facebook page. He said Yar’Adua built strong bridges of hope, love and understanding for which he became a force for national unity and positive change across the country.
