Indigenes of Okuzu-Oba, Idemili South Local Government Area of Anambra State, have protested the proposed appointment of Rev. Uche Ibeabuchi to represent the state at the Federal Character Commission (FCC). The cleric’s name was among the 38 nominees forwarded to the Senate for confirmation. However, the people said their kinsman was not fit to represent them in view of the criminal charges against him. They called for the appointment of a competent character to represent the state at the commission. A statement by the President-General of Oba Patriotic Union, Stephen Orakwute, and Secretary-General Ebele Nweze, accused Ibeabuchi of high-handedness, forceful sale of community lands which proceeds he converted to his personal use. The statement reads: “We write to protest the proposed appointment of Rev. Uche Ibeabuchi as representative of Anambra State at the Federal Character Commission. “Rev. Ibeabuchi is highhanded; he has forcefully sold community lands and converted proceeds to his personal use. He has exhibited at various times that he lacks the communal interest of the Anambra people. “Currently pending at the Federal High Court is an indictment of fraud, cultism and criminal conspiracies against him. In view of the criminal charges and his character indictment, it is our collective decision that Ibeabuchi is not a fit and proper person to represent us. “We, therefore, oppose his nomination and confirmation, and request for the appointment of a competent character to represent us.” Rev. Ibeabuchi however described the allegation as baseless. “My detractors are just jealous and envious because God has elevated me through this appointment.  I’m not a land grabber; I have never sold one or supported anyone in selling people’s land, and beating people. I’m a peace maker,” he said.
