 Katsina Governor Aminu Masari has directed relaxation of the lockdown order imposed across the state from Sunday May 24. The Secretary to the State Government, Mr Mustapha Inuwa, in a statement said the relaxation order is to be observed within local government areas (LGAs) while the ban on movements across LGAs remain in force. The SSG stated the Governor had also directed the Katsina and Daura Emirate Councils to ensure that district and village heads stayed in their domains to observe the forthcoming Eid-el-Fitr. According to him: ”The governor has observed that two-thirds of the COVID-19 cases in the state fell within Katsina, the state capital.  “The residents of the area are therefore warned to strictly observe and adhere to all protocols given by health/security officials, such as wearing face masks, social distancing, regular washing of hands and use of hand-sanitising liquid” “Old people and persons with health challenges are also advised to avoid crowded places.” He explained the decision to relax the lockdown order was reached during the regular review meeting with religious leaders and other stakeholders, adding the decision was taken in the best interest of residents.
