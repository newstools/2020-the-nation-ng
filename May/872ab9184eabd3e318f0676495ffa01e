 THE Department of State Security (DSS), on Monday, charged a dismissed operative, Akindele Femi Omokugbo, 39, before the Kogi State Chief Magistrate court siting in Lokoja, for alleged impersonation and cheating. Omokugbo was arrested last Friday, at Chelstac Clinic, in Kabba/Bunu Local Government Area of the state allegedly attempting to dupe one Ogirima Israel, a medical practitioner. He was arraigned on a two-count charge of impersonation and cheating. The suspect pleaded not guilty to both charges, and was admitted to bail by the Chief Magistrate, Dr Mohammed Tanko. Omokugbo was dismissed in 2014 by the Ondo State Command over alleged involvement in “nefarious activities that impinged on the good image and reputation of the service.” The Chief Magistrate, Dr Mohammed Tanko granted the accused bail in the sum of N100,000 in addition to providing a responsible surety who must be a civil servant of Grade Level 14 or above. He is to remain in the custody of the DSS, Kogi State command, pending the perfection of his bail. The case was adjourned to June 25, 2020. Also, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on Tuesday said that a policeman in Ebonyi State had been dismissed from service after an orderly room trial for allegedly raping a 14-year-old girl in the state. The state coordinator of NHRC, Okorie Christpher Onyekachi stated this in Abakaliki, the state capital, while speaking with reporters. He noted that the commission was working to ensure that the policeman who is in his 30s was prosecuted. He commended the state police command for not shielding him, but lamented that defilement of minors and other sexual violences were on the increase in the state though underreported.
