The General Secretary of the Nigeria Football Federation Dr. Sanusi Mohammed has revealed that the football house is now in receipt of coach Gernot Rohr’s reply with a view of signing a new contract to tinker with the Super Eagles. Sanusi said both parties  are yet to reach an agreement despite  report suggesting that the German tactician has gotten  the nod to continue with his job. He  said the federation will take the final decision on the contract issue after due consultations with the relevant authorities including the leadership of Ministry of Youth and Sports Development, adding the federation cannot make any public pronouncement on the reappointment of the coach without  the approval of the executive board of  the NFF. ” Contract is not what you rush in to, “ Sanusi told NationSport.“ We have given our own conditions which he has responded to; but for now,  the leadership (of NFF)  is looking into what he returned to us. “Contract is an agreement between two parties and in  the contract,  there is need for both parties to agree or disagree. “Technically,  Rohr has not been reappointed and at the right time and when the  agreement  is reached, the public will know. “The football house wants the best for our national team players. “ Rohr is a good coach and for four years he has restored confidence in the senior national team (Super Eagles). “But the Federation is looking beyond qualification for championships and NFF needs a coach who can win trophies and we believe he (Rohr) can do better if both parties agreed on a new contract, ” explained Sanusi. Pressed on when  NFF  will make a pronouncement on Rohr, Sanusi  said such decision will be made as soon as possible once  both parties (NFF) and Rohr  finalize the new engagement.
