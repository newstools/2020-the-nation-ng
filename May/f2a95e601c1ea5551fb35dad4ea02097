Niger Governor Abubakar Sani Bello has extended lockdown order on the state by another two weeks. He banned commercial motorcycle operations across the state. He said the action became necesaary because motorcyclists were constantly flaunting the government orders without any restraint. Speaking with newsmen after a review meeting with the State COVID-19 Taskforce, Bello expressed dismay over how residents have been breaching the COVID-19 social distancing order and wearing of facemasks. “It is regrettable that closure of interstate borders has not been very effective while commercial motorcyclists and other commercial drivers are seen flouting government orders without much ado. ” In view of the prevailing circumstances, there will be a total ban on the operation of Commercial Motorcycle (Okada)for the next two weeks while the status quo remains on all other measures put in place in the last two weeks,” he stated. The Governor stated that plans were ongoing to establish a molecular laboratory and testing centre at the General Hospital, Minna to increase testing capacity and reduce the time for the release of Covid-19 results in the state. He said that 457 health workers had been trained while 20 ad-hoc staff had been recruited to man the laboratory.
