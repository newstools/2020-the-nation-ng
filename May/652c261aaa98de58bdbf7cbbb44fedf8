Tin Can Island Container Terminal (TICT) has donated N100 million to the Federal Government’s COVID-19 Relief Fund. TICT, a multinational port operating company with its terminal at the Tin Can Island Port Complex in Lagos, said the donation would boost the fight against the Coronavirus pandemic in the country. “The donation to the Federal Government is in line with the company’s collaborative approach to act and be recognised as a proactive and pioneering change agent, keen and able to positively contribute to the development of Nigeria and the well-being of the citizens. “We must also observe all other precautionary measures, including social distancing, frequent hand-washing with soap under running water and the use of masks and gloves, as may be applicable,” said Etienne Rocher, TICT Managing Director. Besides the measures taken by the container terminal to prevent the disease, the company has also advised port workers and other users to adhere strictly to safety guidelines issued by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and other governmental authorities to stop the spread of the virus.
