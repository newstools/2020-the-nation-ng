 Former Golden Eaglets striker Terem Moffi has said that a rigorous work ethic is the key to his success with KV Kortrijk in Belgium. Red-hot Moffi has had a brilliant start to life in Belgium before the league was suspended due to the Covid-19 pandemic and was recently named in this season’s Jupiler Pro League dream team of best signings which includes former Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet and Burundi International and Stoke City misfit, Saido Berahino. The 20 year-old has scored four goals in seven games for Kortrijk since his move from Lithuanian side FK Riteriai on a three and a half year deal in January. He was twice voted the Player of the Month by Kortrijk fans and had also won two Man-of-the-Match awards since joining the Northern Belguim side. He scored 21 goals in 30 games in the Lithuanian top league in 2019. “I am really very happy about it, it didn’t really come as a surprise because I really worked hard for it and the four months I spent I had to put everything to make a statement,” Moffi told NationSports. “I am really happy the league recognises and appreciates my efforts,” he added. The former Buckswood School alumni also praised the efforts of his teammates, including Nigeria’s Abdul Jeleel Ajagun and Imoh Ezekiel, for making his four-month journey in Belgium comfortable and dedicated the achievement to them. “I would like to dedicate this achievement to God and also my teammates. The assistance they have given since I Joined Kortrijk in January has been very much and has helped boost my confidence.” “I miss football and I hope the league can resume soon so I can repay their kind gestures towards me,” he added.
