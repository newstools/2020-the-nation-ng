The Basketball Africa League (BAL) is to benefit from a multiyear global partnership between the National Basketball League (NBA) and Wilson Sporting Goods Co. Under the partnership arrangement, Wilson will become the official game ball of the NBA, Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA), NBA G League, NBA 2K League and BAL. The partnership is expected to tip off with the 2021/22 NBA and NBA G League Seasons, 2022 WNBA Season, 2021 NBA 2K League Season, however, the Inaugural BAL season, which is expected to begin later this year if the Coronavirus pandemic is contained, might be the first to benefit from the deal. “This partnership with Wilson returns us to our roots as we plan for the future,” said Salvatore LaRocca, NBA President, Global Partnerships.  “We were partners for 37 seasons dating back to when Wilson manufactured the first official NBA basketballs in 1946, and we look forward to growing the game of basketball together.” Our commitment to growing the game of basketball on the global stage is at the heart of Wilson and our new partnership with the NBA,” said Kevin Murphy, General Manager, Wilson Basketball.
