 A charity organisation, Babatunde Rufai Foundation (BRF), has been launched to cater for people living with disabilities and eradicate poverty. It was launched on Friday by the CEO of ‘Wear It All Luxury’ and ’Wear It All Entertainment’ Sodiq Babatunde Rufai to mark his birthday. Rufai said the mission of the foundation is to ease the suffering of the less privileged, especially during the coronavirus outbreak. ”What better way does one celebrates his birthday other than putting smiles in the faces of the people considering the present situation of the country as a result of the outbreak of the deadly COVID-19 virus,” he stressed.  He said the founcation will direct positive energy in favour of people living with disabilities, youth empowerments, capacity building and poverty alleviation amongst others. ”Today, I am deeply glad that I have been able to reach out to over 2,000 vulnerable people and still counting with our major focus of not just reaching out to people in Lagos alone but to spread our tentacles to other states in the coming weeks,” Rufai stated.
