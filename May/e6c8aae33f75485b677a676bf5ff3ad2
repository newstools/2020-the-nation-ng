 A TRADO-MEDICAL practitioner in Ondo State, Dr. Ola Olasumbo, has asked the Federal and Ondo State governments to allow him treat some COVID-19 patients free of charge. Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu had last week said the state would soon begin the use of herbal drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Akeredolu said he would try the herbs suggested by the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, who urged government to seek internal solution to the cure of the virus. Olasumbo said he accepted the challenge of Governor Akeredolu on the use of herbs to cure COVID-19 and all its symptoms as he has developed possible cure of COVID-19. The herbalist, who addressed reporters in Akure,  the state capital, saids:  “When the virus was reported in China with subsequent confirmed cases in other parts of the world, the association of herbal practitioners in Nigeria met and it was resolved that everyone should go into research towards finding a cure for the virus. “After months of research, I discovered the drug which has already been produced. But what I’m waiting for now is NAFDAC’s approval for the clinical trial to commence. “In the past, I have produced drugs which cured measles and chicken pox as well as other life threatening ailments. So, with this latest discovery, I’m certain that COVID-19 has been defeated.”
