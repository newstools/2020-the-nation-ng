 PRESIDENT of the Handball Federation of Nigeria (HFN) Sam Ocheho has commended League sponsors, Prudent Energy and Services Limited for the N5.5million palliative doled out to team amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Each team participating in the league will get N250, 000 as incentives which will be shared among registered players. Ocheho, overjoyed by the generous gesture, said the palliative would help to cushion the economic effect of the coronavirus pandemic that the players are facing. “A big thank you to our sponsor for remembering us at this difficult time,” Ocheho said. “This is their own way of showing to the players that they care and as sponsors will continue to do all to make players comfortable”. The HFN boss, who on behalf of the Nigeria handball family, assured that the monies would be evenly distributed, revealed that the sponsor were eager for the league to commence as soon as the relevant health authorities give the go ahead. “Prudent Energy look forward to the league resuming post COVID-19 so that handballers can continue doing what they love doing best.”
