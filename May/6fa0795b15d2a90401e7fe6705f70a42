An Ikeja Special Offences Court on Wednesday sentenced a scammer, Lawal Sholaru, to six months imprisonment for defrauding an American, Mr David Geobel, of $1,200 in an online scam. Justice Mojisola Dada, however, gave the convict an option of N100,000 fine after he pleaded guilty to the offence. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) charged the convict on March 18. Justice Dada noted that the convict did not waste the court’s time and was remorseful. “He has exhibited great remorse for his action,” she said. The sentence will commence from March 18 when he was first remanded while he will forfeit a vehicle and any other property recovered from him.
