Rashidi Yekini, who remains Nigeria’s most prolific scorer at full international level with 37 goals in 58 games, has been remembered  by former teammates, fans and officials eight years after his mysterious death, reports scorenigeria.com.ng. Former Eagles coach Sunday Oliseh described Yekini as “Nigeria’s greatest striker of all time”, while another former teammate Mutiu Adepoju said he was “unmatchable”. “I will never forget you, Nigerians will never forget you. Always in our hearts. Rest in peace king Rasheed Yekini. You were created to score goals and your class remains unmatched,” Adepoju tweeted. “Dear mate, I feel honoured playing with you in Nigeria colours and that was a big achievement on its own. You gave your 100% always.” Former Ghana Black Stars defender and now deputy general secretary of the Confederation of African Football (CAF), Anthony Baffoe saluted the one-time African Footballer of the Year: “One of Africa’s most terrific strikers Rashidi Yekini -today marks his 8th year of leaving us. Continue resting in peace Rashidi.” “My best striker of all time; home and abroad,” hailed Tunji Insuranceman, a fan. “I remember screaming at the top of my voice when Yekini scored this goal (opening goal vs Bulgaria at the 1994 World Cup) for Nigeria,” added Ojora Babatunde. Yekini was goal king in Portugal and Cote d’Ivoire. He featured at the 1994 and 1998 World Cups and he is the third leading scorer in the AFCON with 13 goals.
