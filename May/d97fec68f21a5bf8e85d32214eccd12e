Opposition party in Adamawa State, the All Progressives Congress (APC) has said all political parties must stand as one in the fight against their common enemy- COVID-19. The APC took the stance during a press briefing at its state Secretariat in Yola, where the party refrained from any negative comment against the State Government formed by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The state Secretary of the APC, Mr Wafarniyi Theman, who fielded questions from newsmen during the media interaction, said the APC is a responsible party joining hands with the federal and state governments to fight COVID-19. “We will not make statements to score political points. We shall fight the anti-coronavirus fight together,” Theman said, adding, “Just as we are extending solidarity to the federal government in the fight against COVID-19, we are also supportive of the state government to ensure that all hands are on deck to contain the Disease.” He advised all Adamawa residents to see the fight against the disease as their own and respect all rules and measures introduced by health authorities and government to contain the disease. He commended journalists in the state on their determination to carry on their work despite the hazard posed by coronavirus and prayed for the quick recovery of the index case in the state who happens to be a journalist. “We pray that God Almighty heals one of you who is afflicted by the disease. We shall not discriminate against or stigmatize any of  you on account of the disease,” he said.
