 IT is no longer news that there is a strain in the relationship between Governor Seyi Makinde (GSM) of Oyo State and his deputy, Engr. Rauf Aderemi Olaniyan, over the constitution of the Task Force on COVID-19 in the state. But what has kept the state on the edge is the ongoing plot to remove the deputy governor by some forces on a flimsy excuse. If it is true, Oyo State might revert to 1979-1983 era when the then governor of the state, the late Chief Bola Ige squared it up with his deputy, the late Chief Sunday Afolabi. As a youth, GSM was elected to make a difference, not to repeat history and set the state on fire. Some groups are pleading that the governor and his deputy should resolve their differences amicably.
