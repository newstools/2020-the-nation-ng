 Bayelsa State leaders from Ward Five in Ekeremor Local Government Area have endorsed the aspiration of former Governor Seriake Dickson to contest the Bayelsa West Senatorial by-election. Different stakeholders have been calling on the former governor to contest the poll to represent the zone, which comprises Ekeremor and Dickson’s Sagbama local government areas. Before the recent endorsement by Ekeremor youths, prominent Ijaw leaders including Alhaji Asari Dokubo and chieftains of both the Ijaw National Congress and the Ijaw Youth Congress endorsed Dickson as their candidate for the forthcoming Bayelsa West senatorial by-election. The Bayelsa West seat was vacated by Lawrence Ewruhjakpo when he became the deputy governor of the state. Rising from a meeting in Ekeremor the ward leaders said they  consulted widely and critically assessed the credentials and antecedents of everyone jostling to represent Bayelsa West at the Senate. They said following the outcome of their investigations, they decided to endorse Dickson. In a communique signed by 42 leaders, among who were Morris Eyilade, Livingstone Egbemor, Mike Ebiasuode, Soukeme Bekekeme and Ebikabowei Omoro, they contended that Dickson represented a true and audible voice to push for the interest of the Ijaw in the red chamber. They said: “We are confident that he (Dickson) will as always be a true and audible voice to push our people’s interest and by extension the Ijaw nation as he is tested and trusted in the House of Representatives. “We, therefore, call on every progressive minds in Sagbama/Ekeremor to support this noble course in our collective interest. “Let us show our appreciation for the Sagbama/Ekeremor road, Bayelsa State Polytechnic, Aleibiri, health and education facilities among many other things he did for our zone when he was governor.”
