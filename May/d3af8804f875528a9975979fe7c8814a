A member of Yobe State House of Assembly representing Nguru Central Constituency and the only Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) member in the Assembly, Lawan Sani Inuwa Nguru, has confirmed his COVID-19 positive status and gone into isolation. In a statement on Wednesday in Damaturu, the state capital, the lawmaker described the disease as a global challenge. The statement reads: “…Following the result that I tested positive, I immediately went into isolation, as instructed by health officials, as a good citizen and a public figure. I will never undermine the government efforts towards protecting the lives and property in my beloved state. “Several times, I expressed my confidence that the radical measures the Yobe State government has taken would help to stop the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and minimise the damage from it. “As a representative of the people, I always advocate strict adherence to all the advices from the Ministry of Health for our people to stay safe…”
