The leader of Unity Forum, Alhaji Ali Olanusi, on Thursday called for a direct primary for the selection of the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate in Ondo State. He described direct primary as the best option that will forestall post-primary crisis. No fewer than 10 aspirants are competing for the ticket. They include Governor Rotimi Akeredolu (SAN), Chief Olusola Oke (SAN), Mrs. Jumoke Anifowose, Ife Oyedele, Bukola Adetula, Awodeyi Akinsehinwa and Dr. Segun Abraham. Olanusi said in a statement that the chapter is factionalised, adding that only the direct primary can guarantee a level playing field. However, some party members disagreed with Olanusi, saying he does not command the support of the Unity Forum because he has been removed as its leader. Olanusi pointed out that Ondo APC was polarised, stressing that those conveying the impression of unity were hired political miscreants with sinister motives. He said: â€œThe gospel truth is that Ondo APC is divided along factions. Although rumours indicate that some mischievous elements are making efforts to sway and compromise some members of the National Working Committee, I am of the strong belief that no member of the committee will bite such baits.
