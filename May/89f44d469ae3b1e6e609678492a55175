By Omobola Toolu-Kusimo  AIICO Insurance Plc has embarked on a Feeding Relief Programme to cater to the needs of underprivileged communities in Lagos amid the COVID-19 lockdown. The company said it is complementing the government’s efforts in food supply to these communities to ease their burden which arose from the lockdown. With provision to feed 130 people daily for 14 days, the company feeds women, children and young adults. To achieve this, the company collaborated with DreamsFromTheSlum, a non-profit organisation, and Chicken Republic, a retail fast food firm. AIICO Insurance Managing Director, Mr. Babatunde Fajemirokun, stated that the company is prioritising the needs of the vulnerable and less privileged in line with the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goal on ‘Zero Hunger’. ‘’We will continue to pursue causes and drive initiatives to ameliorate the impact of the lockdown, through this season and beyond,” he said. AIICO’s Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Manager, Abimbola Shobanjo  said the company believes this is one way to encourage them to stay at home and to maintain social distancing to avoid the spread of the virus. She said the movement restriction has affected the ability of people to pursue their livelihoods, noting that these are mostly petty traders and artisans in impoverished communities who find it difficult to provide for their families and dependants.
