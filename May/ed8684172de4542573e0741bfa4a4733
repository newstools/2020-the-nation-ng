The appropriateness of the theme “Connect 2030: ICTs for the Sustainable Development Goals” for this year’s World Telecommunication and Information Society Day (WTISD-20) event resides in, and consistent with the linkage between: Resolution 200 at Dubai 2018 regarding “Connect 2030 Agenda” for global telecommunication, information and communication technology, including broadband for sustainable development and the SDGs that integrate in a balanced manner, the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development, and the United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda for sustainable development and the 17 SDGs and related targets, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in Resolution 70/1. Indeed, WTISD-20 is yet another concurrent and concentric reaffirmation of the International Telecommunication Union’s (ITU’s) commitment to connecting all the peoples of the world thereby putting people in touch, whilst showing how communication and information technologies (ICTs) can contribute to accelerating the achievement of the UN’s 2030 Agenda for sustainable development. More often than not, the sustained and surviving methodology for generating fast and astute solutions to global complex challenges that are dynamic, scalar and seemingly unending in nature, are often domiciled and resplendent in the delegation and assignment of most issues to her six main organs and 17 specialized agencies. Incidentally and from time immemorial, each UN’s vision is invariably encapsulated in some form of agenda toward sustainable development across the board in the various areas of human endeavour. Indeed, the convergence of all the various UN’s agendas culminate in the definitive acclamation and commitment to the shared global vision of ensuring the eradication of poverty and disease for all of humanity. The point at current discourse however, is the focus on the technical and transformative issue regarding telecommunications and ICTs for which the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) – the oldest specialized agency of the UN, is fully on the driver seat. And she is also the executing agency for implementing projects under the United Nations Development System. Oftentimes, most issues are resolved in concert with her 193 member nations, almost 800 private-sector entities called development partners, and academic institutions, passionately using the instrumentality  of  local meetings, international conferences, seminars and workshops as vehicles for prompting, analyzing, synthesizing and providing local, regional and international solutions to her multi-dimensional and multifaceted issues that are not only wide ranging but also intrinsically affect the whole world even in their minutiae, by any measure or description. Contingent on the unremitting global professional advice by ITU to all her member nations, the turnaround time of May 17 of each year to the next is adjudged to be adequate as well as significant, as it constitutes part of a period – 31.536 million seconds, within which any nation desirous of growth and development could negotiate the bend and turnaround her economic fortunes and soar her recognition or pride in the global digital economy and comity of nations. And in the course of adopting ICT philosophy; acquiring and deploying ICT systems and networks; applying ICT footprints in every economic, social and environmental sectors; and appropriately cultivating the tradition of using the attendant plethora of ICT gadgetry or products referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT), such a nation would have correspondingly raised the standard of living of her nationals and residents. It is then and only then shall a nation be part of the new economic world order and could then compete favorably in the global digital economy or digital universe referred to as the information society. By every optic and description, it is universally accepted by all that information and communication technologies (ICTs) whose possibilities are limitless, control and synergize the technical corridor across the board, as these technologies enable and accelerate social, economic and environmentally sustainable growth and development for everyone everywhere at the instance of the appropriate and adequate adoption of ICTs globally. Constituting some of the brilliant, exciting, thought-provoking and out-of-the-box ramifications accompanying and wont of this hugely disruptive band of new and unbounded possibilities consistent with or inherent in the power of information and communication technologies (ICTs) include:   Smart homes with all manner of interactive automation; intelligent cities; efficient and intelligent networks of diverse businesses epitomized by data-centric e-commerce otherwise described as the emergence and incursion of Big Data into the DNA and calculus of business and commerce;  employees working smarter in ultra-high productivity environment and sometimes working from home (WFH – telecommuting); irreversibly transformed workplaces; cleaner environments with less wastes (e-waste); responsive and healthier living; electronic education, thus making learning more engaging, interactive and innovative; smarter and cleaner water management; cleaner power supply; satellite monitoring and surveillance that could help us better understand our planet’s ever-changing climate thus protecting all life forms from the very big to the very small; and more engaged populations living together on a smaller and more connected planet. Is it not spectacular and stunning to observe that a single device (modern smartphone) that fits in your pocket can do all the tasks that once required cameras, camcorders, GPS devices, watches, alarm clocks, calculators and even TVs, and now in its mobile-wallet configuration, it also eliminates the traditional carriage of cash and credit cards? By any stretch, could you have imagined how a swab from the surface of your smartphone might reveal your lifestyle profile that in turn could be analyzed and used for various purposes? Indeed, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) being the sole driver of ICTs promises to connect all the peoples of the world whilst showing how communication and information technologies (ICTs) can contribute to accelerating the achievement of the UN’s 2030 Agenda for sustainable development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This is more so primus inter pares and urgent because it is only through full interconnectedness of the world shall global issues such as natural disasters, climate change, pandemics and growing inequalities of all kinds etcetera, be appropriately and continually   interrogated, examined and resolved thereby making humanity safer, more secured, stronger, more comfortable and bountiful if and only if she is more connected. The essence of WTISD-2020 under the glorious and golden auspices of the ITU as ever, is to help create awareness of the possibilities that the use of the Internet and other information and communication technologies (ICTs) can bring societies and economies together, as well as create innovative ways to bridging the pressing digital divide, and that is only possible and pragmatic if peoples of the world are highly-networked and massively-connected especially so within the “Decade of Action” in question (2020-2030) hitherto launched by the Secretary-General of the United Nations – António Guterres; as the only condition that social, economic and environmental progress, security and safety can be ascertained. Thus, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) shall then be deemed to have accelerated the cause and achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development of the United Nations and her 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and related targets.
