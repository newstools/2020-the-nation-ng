THE Lagos State government has further extended the deadline for filing Annual Tax Returns to June 30. Yearly returns for individuals (employees and self-employed persons) that were initially due for May 31, can now be filed on or before June 30. The extension, the Executive Chairman, Lagos State Internal Revenue Service (LIRS), Mr. Ayodele Subair, said is in the government’s continuous effort to provide the much needed relief to taxpayers and mitigate the economic impact of Covid-19 pandemic. Subair said: “As the Lagos State government keeps abreast of global best practices in containing the Covid-19 pandemic and eases the effects of an economic downturn on taxpayers and residents of the state, LIRS had initially extended the deadline for filing annual tax returns for two months, from the statutory March 31st of every fiscal year to May 31, 2020. “We constantly debated what other measures could be taken as an organisation to support individuals and businesses at this time, hence, the additional one-month extension from June 1, to June 30, 2020. ‘’It is our sincere hope that taxpayers take advantage of this new extension to duly file their returns. “Taxpayers are, therefore, encouraged to access the LIRS eTax platforms for all tax administration matters, including filing of annual returns, generation of assessment and payment schedule and payment of the liabilities from the comfort of their homes and offices. All that they have to do is to simply log on to the e-Tax platform.” He said updates on business operations and alternative payment platforms of the service could be obtained by visiting the LIRS website, checking its various social media platforms or calling its Customer Care Centre.
