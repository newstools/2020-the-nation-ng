Police in Fort Worth, Texas, have said that five people were wounded after shots were fired whilst fireworks exploded in a park crowded with 600 people at the weekend. Two victims were in a critical condition on Sunday night, and three had non-life threatening injuries, said police. Fort Worth Police were dispatched to Village Creek Park at around 7 pm on Sunday, where 600 people had gathered prior to the shooting. Officers found five people with injuries, all of whom were transported to local hospitals. “The best thing we can do for them is obviously pray and … get them some medical care right now,” said Public Information Officer Buddy Calzada. He added that witnesses had heard 30 rounds of gunfire immediately after fireworks exploded on Sunday night. It is not clear why hundreds had gathered at the centre of Village Creek Park, near Fort Worth. The park had reopened on April 20 after all 89 Texas state parks were closed to stop the spread of Covid-19. Residents have continued to be encouraged to practice social distance since parks were opened. But a video uploaded to Twitter showed crowds running from the park on Sunday night after gunshots had been heard. People ran into the street, and some were seen ducking behind cars as noises could be heard. Police said that it was possible the Village Creek Park shooting was related to another shooting that took place nearby, on Sunday. “We’ve been stating that everyone would follow the rules that have been set out,” said Mr Calzada on the crowd. He continued: “We’ve tried to work with everybody to not try to cite them or ticket them but ultimately people have a choice and that’s just the choice they made tonight.” No suspects have been caught following the incident.
