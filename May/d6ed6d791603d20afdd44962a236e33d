Super Eagles defender, Ola Aina has revealed that he decided it was time for him to seek pasture new after he got no assurances from then Chelsea boss, Maurizio Sarri that he was part of his plans two seasons ago. Aina joined Chelsea  as a schoolboy in 2012-13 and was always a constant feature in the youth league but he never got more assurances to play for the main team. He was on loan to Championship side, Hull City in the summer of 2017 and after a short return, he was farmed out to AC Torino in the Serie A on another loan deal after he was allegedly told by Sarri he won’t get game time. The Nigerian wing-back spoke to Football Italia on their Instagram live stream interview. “Sarri told me I would have to go on loan, I would not have played,” said Aina of their 2018 conversation. “During the market, I received offers from Championship clubs, but I wanted to play in the Premier League. “When Torino came for me, I accepted immediately because I would have had the opportunity to play in Serie A, in important stadiums and against top-level teams and players and above all in a team that wanted to go to the Europa League.” The 23-year-old made the move permanent for 10m Euros in the summer of 2019, after a year on loan with Torino. So far this season, he has contributed two assists in 25 competitive appearances for the Granata.
