 Professor of English and popular author, Mrs. Akachi Adimora-Ezeigbo, has urged government to be prepared to check a surge in the number of out-of-school children as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In an interview with The Nation, Prof. Adimora-Ezeigbo expressed concerns that the pandemic would increase school dropout levels as a result of rising cost of education if the pandemic is still around in the next three-four months. Before the pandemic, Nigeria had over 10.5 million out-of-school children – the highest in the world. The former Head of English Department at the University of Lagos (UNILAG), underscored the need for government to take appropriate steps to reduce the number of children roaming the streets aimlessly. “Illiteracy levels could jerk up if the Coronavirus pandemic continues for the next three to four months. That will be very terrible.  Already, everybody is affected.  Most students in private schools are likely to drop out because of high fees. Nonetheless, government should try to put the situation under control because the economy is already affected,” she noted. While decrying overcrowding and congestion in schools, Prof. Adimora-Ezeigbo urged government to ensure strict compliance with physical and social distancing rules if schools are to re-open anytime soon. “Countries in Europe will be re-opening schools next month, for instance, Austria and some others.  I think our government should try to do the same. But they need to put the right measures in place particularly to ensure social distancing rules in schools that are over-populated. For instance, in some classes you find 100-200 students. It will be difficult to cope and apply distancing rules,” she said. She warned that if the COVID-19 situation lingers further,it portends danger to the country and the education sector, adding that most students could drop out of school as a result of financial crisis.
