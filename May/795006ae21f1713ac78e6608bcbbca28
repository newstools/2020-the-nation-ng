 THE Federal Polytechnic at Oko in Anambra State has produced an automated anti-Coronavirus machine. The inventors sought federal and state governments’ assistance to enable the institution perform better in its innovations. The institution said it was ready to produce 20 of the machine within a week to reduce the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, if it could get financial assistance. The leader of the manufacturing team, Christopher Osuji, and engineer, said the school planned to produce 100 for sale to institutions, governments and markets, among others. Unveiling the machine on Wednesday, the polytechnic’s Rector Dr Francisca Nwafulugo said the materials used in the machine were locally soureced. She said it was a project the Federal government, corporate organisations and state should support for the school to produce more. The production of the anti-COVID-19 machine, according to the Rector, will reduce the spread of the global pandemic.
