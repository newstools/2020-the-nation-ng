The Managing Director, Rack Centre, Dr. Ayotunde Coke, has said coronavirus (COVID-19) has shown the elasticity of global technology infrastructure and brought about the era of the new normal. He said the global information technology (IT) infrastructure available has allowed people to work from home, stressing that   social media platforms, such as Instagram Live, Facebook Live, and LinkedIn Live, that have enabled virtual meetings, conferences and other engagements, while Microsoft Team, Zoom, Google MEET and other technologies, have upped their game, granting access and control routes to the users. Rack Centre is Africa’s premium Tier III certified co-location data centre services provider. According to Coker, at the base of these infrastructures are the data hosting companies and the telecommunication network operators. Thus, COVID-19 is spurring a ‘new normal’ where creative and innovative ecosystem is springing up and multidisciplinary thinkers at individual and group levels now come up with solutions to economic, social and sustainable development. Coker spoke on “Technology and infrastructure: Enabling the new normal” during a webinar call with IT editors in Lagos, described post-Covid-19 era as business unusual as it will impact on 10 major business areas, including working from home, which will lead to the growth of semi-flex offices. “I don’t think it is just going to be working from home. There is something I call semi-flex office locations. “Imagine someone travelling from Agege to a contact centre somewhere on the Island, which is about three hours journey (due to traffic situations), you will find semi-flex office locations about half an hour into the journey and walk in, put your laptop down and with your headphone you connect to the contact centre and perform some routine due to the exigencies of your assignment. So, you are kind of working from home but from a semi-flex location,” he said.
