 A gale of strange deaths has hit some Yobe communities in the last one week. Our correspondent gathered that Potiskum and Gashua towns in Postiskum and Bade Local Government of the state are the most affected by the development. Recods obtained from different graveyards in Potiskum by The Nation indicate with a space of one week, not less than 100 people were buried. A breakdown of the figures show: Mamman Ali 49 graveyard; Hospital graveyard-12; SOCOL graveyard-18; Gishiwa Dabua graveyard-11; Nasarawa graveyard-6; Lamba Mai Adikko graveyard-2. The same scenario is reported in Gashua where more than 50 were reported to have died within three days. Investigation revealed that the deceased were mostly elderly. It is unclear if the deaths had anything to do with  COVID-19. The Commissioner for Health Mohammed Lawan Gana, who is also the Vice Chairman of the Committee on COVID-19, said investigations were on to know the causes of the deaths. ”The ministry of Health is investigating the cause of the deaths but until we find out the cause, we cannot associate it to COVID 19,” Gana said.
