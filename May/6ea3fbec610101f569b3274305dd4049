The Federal Executive Council (FEC) on Wednesday approved another N4,080,261,992 for projects in Works and Housing, Aviation, Transportation, and Petroleum Resources ministries. The FEC meeting in Abuja was presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari, with other top government officials, like Vice-President Professor Yemi Osinbajo (SAN), Secretary to Government of the Federation (SGF) Boss Mustapha, Chief of Staff to the President, Professor Ibrahim Gambari and the National Security Adviser, Major General Babagana Monguno (retd.), in attendance. Addressing State House Correspondents after the meeting, Ministers of Information and Culture as well as Transportation, and the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources – Alhaji Lai Mohammed, Rotimi Amaechi and Chief Timipre Sylva – gave details of the approvals. Mohammed said FEC approved an augmentation for the contract sum for the construction of Oseakwa Bridge in Anambra State. He explained that the contract was awarded to Messrs Horizon Construction Limited at N896,863,516.25 for the 90-metre long bridge with two kilometres approach road and completion period of 12 months. The Information Minister also explained that the contract, having attained 87.91 per cent completion, was stalled in 2012 as two kilometres approach road to the bridge could not be completed due to flood that ravaged the vicinity of the project. “It appears flooding was not envisaged at the time of the award and thus necessary provision for its containment not made in the contract sum. “Having sought and obtained Presidential approval for submitting variation in respect of project above 15 per cent (according to extant act), the ministry sought and obtained BPP due process certificate of ‘no objection’ in the sum of N118,061,552.99, thereby revising total contract sum to N1,014,925,069.25. “A total of 285 jobs, comprising 187 skilled and 98 unskilled, are expected to be created, thereby mitigating the effect of COVID-19 on unemployment,” he said. Mohammed said FEC approved N101 million for the provision of a flight simulator building at the Nigeria College of Aviation, Zaria, Kaduna State. “The memo was presented by the Minister of Aviation and an approval was given for the revised estimated cost for the construction of Boeing 737 full flight simulator building for the Nigerian College Aviation Technology, Zaria, originally awarded for N993,484,980.60 and is being reviewed to N1,095,475,750.04,” he said. Amaechi said FEC approved the award of Consultancy Training Services contract to Swets Marine Consultancy at $454,050 for sea-time training for the Nigerian Seafarers Development Programme for cadets on-board foreign-going vessels by the Nigerian Maritime Administration and safety Agency (NIMASA). The consultancy sum, calculated at N350 to $1 (official rate), amounted to 158,917,500. He said: “Messr SWETS Marine, the contractor, accepted BPP downward review of the ministry’s offer from $510,000 to $454,050.” The minister said the contract had been adequately provided for “in the 2019 and 2020 budgets at N1,338,093,214 and N1,008,093,214.23 respectively”. Also, the FEC yesterday approved proposals by the ministries of Education as well as Finance, Budget and National Planning for projects estimated at over N1,348,057,600.
