 THE Director-General of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, on Friday said that Nigerians will have to learn to live with the coronavirus (COVID-19) until a vaccine is found. He made this declaration while addressing the issue of stigmatization towards those that have been infected with the virus, following a complaint by a member of the staff of DAAR Communications PLC at the briefing of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 that the staff and people related to the founder of the organisation, Chief Raymond Dokpesi, who tested positive for COVID-19, were being stigmatised. Ihekweazu said: “Concerning stigmatization for persons who are infected with COVID-19, and maintaining the balance between social distancing and stigmatization, it is really unfortunate. “Imagine what will be happening in the other parts of the country if this is really happening in Abuja, in homes or communities where individuals have been affected. “We are in the beginning of a journey and the most likely scenario is that until we have a vaccine, we will have to learn to live with COVID-19 in our country. “So if we start stigmatizing one another, I don’t know when it will stop because the same people that are stigmatising one group will end up being infected tomorrow. “
