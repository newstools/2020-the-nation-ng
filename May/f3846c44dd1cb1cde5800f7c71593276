As many supporters would have loved to celebrate the life and times of Senator Isiaka Adeleke also known as ‘Serubawon’, his close relative is yet to recover from the death of the astute politician and philanthropist. Of all his, most cherished ambitions, governing Osun State once again was one of the unfulfilled dreams of the first executive Governor of Osun state, who died on April 23, 2017, at 62. Although he might have gone to rest, his legacies can never be forgotten in a hurry in Osun state. Even as a Senator, he represented the interest of his constituents with his heart. Last Thursday, marking his 3rd remembrance, many of his supporters were prevented from gathering at his burial cenotaph to once again pray for the deceased and show their unflinching loyalty even though he is no more. Sources said; “If not for the restriction from the Coronavirus outbreak, a mammoth crowd would have trooped into his country home in Ede, Osun state to pay their respect to the seasoned politician. Several Mosques would have organised a program in his memory most especially during this fasting period. If he was alive, he would have donated heavily to the needy in times like this. To avoid top many contacts by maintaining social distancing, only his immediate family members and few close relatives we present at his remembrance gathering.”
