 THE Lagos State government said it would not tolerance any illegal property development across the metropolis. The Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, Dr. Idris Salako, stated this yesterday on a visit to the Magodo wetland. He said the Ministry of Physical Planning and Urban Development, being responsible for the maintenance of an orderly, livable and sustainable environment in the state, would continue to implement the “zero tolerance” policy on illegal physical developments, including the regrettable encroachment of the sensitive/ecological zones. He said the visit became imperative as part of measures to prevent the misuse or abuse of all Greenbelts, Gorges, Water bodies, Wetlands and other vulnerable natural landscapes in every part of the state.  He assured Lagosians that the Ministry would continue to intensify efforts at enhancing the sustainability of the environment by maintaining a diligent application of the state’s policies and development plans. The commissioner directed the sealing of  unapproved developments within the wetland zone, as well as buildings that exhibited signs of internal distress through tilting or cracks, thereby raising questions about their structural stability. Salako was accompanied on the visit by the Special Adviser to the Governor on Urban Development, Mr. Ganiyu Adele Ayuba; Permanent Secretary in the Ministry, Foluso Adebayo Dipe; General Manager, Lagos State Physical Planning Permit Authority,   Funmi Oshifuye; General Manager, Lagos State Building Control Agency,  Biola Kosegbe and General Manager, New Towns Development Authority,  Kunle Aboyeji. The government had earlier decried the illegal  housing development along the Magodo greenbelt area.
