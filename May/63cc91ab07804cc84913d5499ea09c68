Fast-rising singer Princess Peters has bagged Rookie of the year for her single ‘Urhuese’. She bagged the award at the Charisma award 2020, which attested to recognition of the massive works that went into the project. The single has been one of the most played songs in Nigeria. The artist, after receiving the award, vowed to do more especially in creating a new atmosphere for the dwindling gospel music scene. According to her: “Gospel music is not enjoying much hype as most Nigerians prefer to listen to secular music. This could be really painful for selected singers who chose this niche but I am always motivated to change the phase of every situation I find myself and I will be doing everything possible by the grace of God to elevate the gospel music niche in Nigeria”.
