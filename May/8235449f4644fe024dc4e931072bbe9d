Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare has called for proposals for the renovation of the training camps in Mambila (Taraba State) and Pankshin (Plateau state) in a bid to increase Nigeria’s medal haul in long distance races at international sporting events. Dare who gave the directive at a virtual meeting with coaches and stakeholders mandated them to scout for talents; camp current runners and develop training programme towards the revival of long-distance races. The Minister said: “Following this meeting, you will put forward a proposal as a team and I am sure we can conduct an audit and I am sure some of you know what is needed to bring back Pankshin and Mambila. “Once we see that plan, we can now slice that plan up into two or three stages, what is needed in the short run to activate it quickly to start developing these talents, with the Olympics in view.” “The resources we have are not unlimited, they are limited. But the ministry will leverage on what it can get and as we prepare the 2021 budget, I will make sure that long distance gets a very close attention,”  Dare promised. Professor Ezra Gunen, Tony Osheku, Stephen Nuhu and Timon Gunen, Nigeria’s 5,000m record holder as well as Directors of the Sports in the ministry joined the meeting to provide insights into long distance races and how best to improve Nigeria’s ranking.
