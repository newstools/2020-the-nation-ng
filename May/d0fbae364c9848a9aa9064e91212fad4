 The Nation can exclusively report that the over three hours delay being experienced by UK returnees at the Lagos airport is due to the fumigation of the Air Peace aircraft due to fly them to Abuja. A ground staff said the airline was not prepared to take risk as the lives and health of the returnees remain very important. The Nation cited the aircraft to be used for the flight on the tarmac surrounded by prepared staff of the airline. The airline, Anuli Peggy Onyema, is a B777-300. However there is no government official in sight to receive or address the returnees after over three hours they arrived Lagos. Many of them complain of inhuman treatment, hunger and thirst, forcing Air Peace to provide them with over 20 cartoons of bottled water to cool their thirst. An official of the airline said: “We cannot leave our brothers and sisters to remain thirsty. “Though we are not to provide such until you guys get on board, but he have to do this for humanity.”
