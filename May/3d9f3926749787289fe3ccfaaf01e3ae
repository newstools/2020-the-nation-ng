 FORMER Square Records signee, May D, has recounted his early beginnings when he lived with defunct duo, Psquare. May D, during a live video chat with music platform, TooXclusive, said it was a huge privilege to have lived in Psquare’s home – boys quarters – as at the time he did. “I’m thankful for everything they’ve ever done for me. Do you think it was easy to be living at Psquare’s boys quarters then na big boy dey stay for there?” May D asked. However, the singer said his outburst with the Okoye brothers was triggered when he was labeled greedy for wanting a legal agreement and terms of his signing with Square Records.  “So it was because they said I was greedy I had to come say yo bro I wasnt greedy if I was, would I be staying at your boys quarters? I get room for my papa house but I stayed there, I just say make I dey with una make everybody dey together. I no even send the boys quarter P, my own na say make I get wetin I want because I know that at the end of the day bro everything go dey alright,” he said. May D further revealed that he wrote an album for the Psquare and earned three hundred dollars after going on tour with them. “As I be greedy guy na wey I write album for una, we go follow go show wey una go make almost a million dollars una go give me three hundred dollars i never complain before o but i be greedy guy I dey with una since 2008. bro don’t even let us go there I don’t want sentiment but I love them.”
