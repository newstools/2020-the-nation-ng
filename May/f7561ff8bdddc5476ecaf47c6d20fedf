Chief Executive Officer of Monimichelle Ebi Egbe has commended Imo State governor Hope Uzodinma on  the recent appointment of former Director General of defunct National Sports Commission (NSC) Chief (Dr) Patrick Ekeji as his  Deputy Chief  of Staff. Egbe noted that  the ex- international is an astute administrator who would add value to the government and people of  Imo State government :”Ekeji’s appointment as Deputy Chief of Staff to His Excellency Hope Uzodinma is well deserved. He  is a sound and astute administrator that would add value to governance in  Imo state. Governor Uzodinma has brought on board a man that would help him drive his vision of accelerated development of Imo state,” Egbe stated. He pointed out that Ekeji’s appointment would impact  positively on Imo sports, since sports remain Ekeji’s primary constituency :”Ekeji may not be holding a sports position, but he would definitely not abandon his primary constituency which is good for Imo sports. “ Again, he is working with a governor that is a sportsman as a former President of the Nigeria Wrestling Federation (NWF) as such, Imo sports is definitely going to enjoy a new lease of life under the administration of Governor Uzodinma,” he noted.
