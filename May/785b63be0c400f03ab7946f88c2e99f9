Forty years after the tragic demise of the traditional music icon, Ayinla Omowura, prominent dignitaries including Ebenezer Obey and Tunde Kelani pay tributes. Celebrating the hero, a book on his life was launched on Wednesday, May 5. The book, entitled: “Ayinla Omowura: Life and Times of An Apala Legend,” is a 537-page research work written by Festus Adebayo. According to the author, the actual presentation, which could not be done due to COVID-19 lockdown, will be virtual by the two notable Nigerians from their different bases. “The choice of the two foremost Nigerians and eminent Yoruba sons is an acknowledgment of their voices as cultural, musical, and Yoruba societal leaders. While Oba Adeyemi is a cultural repository of the Yorubaland which Omowura’s music projected to the whole world, Chief Fabiyi, apart from being an Egba kingsman of Ayinla’s, also uses his music to exemplify the richness of the Yoruba people’s language and culture,” Adebayo said. Also, veteran filmmaker, Tunde Kelani shared a poster of the late musician on his social media handle and captioned: “On May 6, 1980, Ayinla Omowura, the Apala music superstar was killed in a beer parlor brawl at Abeokuta. He was at the peak of his meteoric rise to stardom. Forty years after, his musical legacy lives on.” Ayinla Omowura And His Apala Group recorded hit tracks including Awa Kise Olodi Won, Danfo o si ere, Anjonu elere, Owo Tuntun, Ebi kin pagun d’ojo ale and many others. Born in 1933, Omowura is regarded as the Apala music legend after his death at the age of 47.
