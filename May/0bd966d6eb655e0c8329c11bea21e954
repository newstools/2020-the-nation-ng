Prince Olu Kosoko, a Principal Consultant of Alpha Gravida Consulting Limited, is an expert in brand management and destination branding. With years of experience in selling tourism using Badagry as a point of view, he has canvassed several bodies to invest heavily in Badagry which possesses an aquatic endowment for water sports, leisure, and commercial activities. The Aremo of Iworo Kingdom, Badagry in Lagos, during the coronavirus pandemic lockdown, joined several organisations by extending his hand of benevolence to both states and the federal governments using his Olu Kosoko Foundation, to carter for the people at the grassroots level. On April 28, the foundation had reached out to widows, the aged, vulnerable, youths and people of Badagry with cash. Celebrating his birthday on Wednesday, May 20, in the United Kingdom, the philanthropist’s NGO reached out to the less privileged doling out cash and meal packages to Muslim faithful who observed the just-concluded Ramadan fasting. Kosoko averred that” Africa will be greatly affected by this economic harshness and recession but I believe the best way to celebrate life is to give back to life. The grassroots communities are naturally exposed to these difficult times. OK Foundation is motivated by the community spirit and love that exists within them. I want to be grateful for lives and give support to people in these challenging times.”
