Morakinyo Abodunrin and Olalekan Okusan German coach Gernot Rohr has promised to put up his level best following the confirmation of the extension of his Super Eagles contract by the Nigeria Football Federation(NFF). NFF President Amaju Pinnick confirmed on Wednesday via his twitter handle @PinnickAmaju that the Federation has agreed formally to hand Rohr a new contract, adding it has confidence in the abilities of the German. “I’m happy to announce that the @thenff and Coach Gernot Rohr have concluded all contractual discussions and he will stay on as Coach of the Super Eagles. We have always had confidence in his abilities and we are confident that the national team can only go higher from here,” Pinnick said. Rohr, in a swift message to NationSport, said he was not oblivious of the task ahead, stating he was ready to work his socks to ensure the Super Eagles’ continuous progress. “ We will try our best, “ stated the former Bayern Munich defender.“ We want to continue to progress but ambition must be based on humility; a lot of work to do.” Yet according to Pinnick, the coach has been given a target to lift the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroun as well as qualification for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. He said: “We can now focus on qualifying for the World Cup and winning the Nations Cup. In truth, these are sacrosanct and Coach Rohr is aware of these conditions. “Like the Honourable Minister of Youth and Sports Development has rightly noted; we are uncompromising in these goals. The board of the Federation & I are totally in agreement with the minister on the goals for the team and it is unwavering. “With the distraction of the contract talks out of the way now, we can now face our football on the pitch, totally. Again, I never lost confidence in Gernot Rohr’s ability to take our football forward and I’m convinced our football will only get better from here on,” Pinnick noted.
