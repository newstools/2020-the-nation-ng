Mike Tyson named Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder in his top five favourite current boxers but didn’t include two-time heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua. Fury, who recently claimed the WBC heavyweight title in a rematch with Wilder, has always earned the respect from Tyson since his comeback in 2018 and the former American heavyweight said he ‘respects’ the Gypsy King. However, he did not mention Fury’s next potential opponent and rival heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua when listing his favourite current fighters. ‘I respect Tyson Fury, I respect Deontay Wilder, I respect all of those guys,’ Tyson explained on his own podcast, Hotboxin’. Andy Ruiz also, this guy named (Vasyl) Lomachenko – he’s a f****** animal, man. He’s a master, it’s like he’s dancing. ‘There’s also Gervonta Davis, there’s quite a few guys that are good fighters.’ Tyson went on to explain that boxing has become a very ‘political’ sport and complained that the promoters are not allowing the best to enter the ring against each other and give the fans the bouts they want to see. He added: ‘The situation is whether they will fight each other. Promoters are not allowing them to fight each other. I’d love to see them fight each other but the promoters don’t want to do it.’ ‘It (boxing) is very political now. That’s why I think in the next couple months or so you’re going to find that there are some new players in the game and it’s going to get really serious.’ Tyson is preparing for a sensational return to the ring at 53 years old, after he mentioned he would like to make a comeback for charity.
