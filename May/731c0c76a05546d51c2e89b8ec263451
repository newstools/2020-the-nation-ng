 The National Automotive Design and Development Council (NADDC)has praised the industry firms and stakeholders who have supported the government in its fight against the spread of the Covid-19. Its Director-General Mr. Jelani Aliyu said he was elated with the support the automotive industry is rendering to the Federal and state governments. Their gestures, Aliyu said, showed the stakeholders’ commitment to safeguarding and strengthening societies across the nation. Stallion Empowerment Initiative, the philanthropic arm of Stallion Group, is supplying locally produced rice and fish to all the government-run hospitals dedicated to COVID-19 for three months. Innoson, Simba and others have also risen to the occasion of producing relevant health-related vehicles such as ambulances. CFAO, CIG, Weststar, Toyota Nigeria Limited, among others, had given their support to the government in the fight against COVID-19. CEO of Stallion Group, Anant Badjatya, said the company is still providing one staff bus each for the five government-run COVID-19 hospitals in Lagos with drivers and fuel for these buses. The arrangement, Badjatya said, will help ensure safer and comfortable transportation of the health care workers. Stallion Group Chairman Mr. Sunil Vaswani, said: “These are exceptionally difficult times and urgent emergency resources have to be deployed to cope with the needs of affected states and support their healthcare systems. “At Stallion Group, our top priority is the health and safety of our employees, customers and our community. There is nothing greater than the safety of the people of this country and it is our responsibility to support the government and the community in this time of need. We are deeply grateful to every healthcare worker and person who has risked their lives to fight this pandemic and will continue to support them.”
