Imo State Health Commissioner Dr. Damaris Osunkwo has said the state government had traced 37 contacts traced to the index case. In a statement on Thursday in Owerri, the state capital, Osunkwo said the contact persons being traced had not exhibited the symptoms of the virus and were in self-isolating. According to her, since the case was confirmed, the ministry, in collaboration with Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), AFNET and World Health Organisation (WHO), had enlisted and started daily follow-up with 37 persons so far. “More contacts are being sorted for enlistment. Meanwhile, the confirmed case is already in isolation and treatment centre where he is doing quite well. “All the contacts being followed up have remained without symptoms and self-isolating, she said. “We are escalating sample collection and laboratory testing. So far, all the samples sent to the laboratory have come negative except the index case,” Dr. Osunkwo said. Also, the state government has denied reports that it impounded some trucks conveying food and beverages in Owerri on Tuesday and slammed N50,000 fine on them to pass through the state. A statement yesterday by the Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Declan Emelumba, said the illegal act was perpetrated by those he called thugs.
