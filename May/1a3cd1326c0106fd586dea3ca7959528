One of the 265 Nigerians airlifted back home from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is dead, Lagos Health Commissioner Prof Akin Abayomi, has confirmed. The 265 were in the first batch of 678 Nigerians flown back into the country from the UAE, United Kingdom (UK) and United States (U.S.). Prof Abayomi tweeted on Tuesday: “The death of a recent Dubai returnee previously announced on my social media handles earlier was a presumed #COVID19 related death. The result of the confirmation test for #COVID19 status is still being awaited. The result of #COVID19 test conducted will be published once it is ready.” “The deceased recently returned from Dubai with severe underlying health condition.” All the returnees are being isolated to determine their COVID-19 status. They will be tested on the 13th day in seclusion.
