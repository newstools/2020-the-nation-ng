NIGERIAN rising singer Olotu Adebayo aka BYT has said that he does not have a role model in the music industry, unlike other rising artists. The 29-year-old Edo state born singer, who recently dropped his latest single, ‘we rise up,’ made this known in a recent chat with The Nation. “I don’t have a role model in music but I have mentors from life in general”, said BYT. The music act further revealed the full meaning of his moniker as BYTunes (Bayo Tunes). In 2018, BYT released his first Extended play (EP) titled ‘Sweet Life’ and in 2019, he released several number of hit singles including ‘Body IP’ which earned him massive recognition nationwide. His latest single ‘We rise up’ is produced by award-winning producer, Fliptycebeat and had the video shot by Aaron Items. The singer noted that despite his contract with his current record label Copacetic music, he is open to record deals and labels both internationally and locally. The University of Benin political science graduate on future collaborations said he would love to have D’Banj on his song, however on his challenges as an upcoming act, he said “my major challenge as a rising star is less capital for the music business in general among other minor challenges,” said BYT.
