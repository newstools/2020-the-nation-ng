 Afropop singer Davido has promised to dole out the sum of N1.4 million in 14 days to cushion the effect of lockdown on fans in Nigeria while promoting his new music video, ‘D&G’. The father of three made the announcement a few hours before his fiancee, Chioma Rowland’s 25th birthday on April 30. According to the 27-year-old singer, the sum of N100,000 will be won by fans daily for the next 14 days as he promotes his new music video featuring Summer Walkers. “As you guys know, I just dropped a new video featuring my girl Summer Walker, amazing video D&G off the album ‘A Good time’. And guess what, I know people are having a hard time staying at home, people are going through stuff in this difficult situation.  So I felt like let’s do a challenge, be creative, be spontaneous. I want to see something different and I’m going to be giving out 100 thousand Naira every day for 14 days. I’m excited to see what you guys are going to do. So let’s go thriller, D&G challenge starts now.” Earlier before the announcement, Davido had told CNN that he will be donating the proceeds of the new music video to COVID-19 research. In a recent interview with CNN, Davido said he will be donating the proceeds from the music video to Dolce & Gabbana and Humanitas Together for Coronavirus Research fund. The video, which was released on Friday, April 24 off his ‘A Good Time’ album, is geared to strengthen efforts toward scientific research benefitting global health.
