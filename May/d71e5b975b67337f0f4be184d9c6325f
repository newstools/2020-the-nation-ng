 YORUBA Tennis Club has hailed Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu for tackling COVID-19 pandemic. The Chairman, Olawunmi Agbaje, who spoke on Thursday on Lagos Island when the club distributed palliatives comprising rice, beans and garri to the public, said the Lagos State Government had done a lot to reduce the spread of Coronavirus. Agbaje, in company with other members of the club, handed over the items to the residents of Lawson, Bassey, Araromi, Campus, Beckley and their environs on Lagos Island. He expressed concern about the well-being of Lagosians. Agbaje, an architect, said: “This is the best time to show love and care to the people, hence the decision by the elders, management and members of the club to put smiles on people’s faces, especially those living around where our club is situated.” Besides the communities, the club also gave food items to the Federal Fire Service Station, Onikan, Lagos; Nigeria Police Station, Onikan and Onikan Health Centre. The Managing Director, Onikan Health Centre, Dr. Peters Oladipupo, thanked members and management of the club for giving the centre palliatives. He prayed that the good Lord would bless the club.
