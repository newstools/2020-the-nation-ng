Former Super Eagles goalkeeper, Vincent Enyeama, has shared his thoughts on what it feels like playing over 100 games for Nigeria and his most memorable periods with Enyimba. Enyeama played 101 games for the Eagles before he decided to call it quits with the national team in 2015 after the game against the Cranes of Uganda in Uyo. The former senior national team goalkeeper told Brila FM in an interview that it won’t have been possible without his family and his fellow players and others. “It is not easy to be the highest cap Nigerian player. You had to fly for over 100 times to achieve that,” Enyeama disclosed. “It is a kind of pride but the truth be told that it won’t have been possible without my family, my great players. “An excellent goalkeeper is the one with good defence; he also has great midfield and excellent striking force in front.” Enyeama also described the three seasons he spent with Enyimba and this moulded him for the challenges he had as a goalkeeper in Europe. He noted that the memories of winning the CAF Champions League in two consecutive years were the high points of his stay with the People’s Elephant and he attributed it to the role played by the then Governor of Abia State, Orji Uzor Kalu and the club Chairman, Felix Anyansi Agwu. He said: “My high point was winning the two Champions League because no other Nigerian has won the competition since then. It makes me to be proud of myself, my teammates and so proud of the organization and Nigeria. “Orji Uzor Kalu came in and did an excellent job. Felix Anyansi Agwu is a wonderful manager and the players we had like Obinna Nwaneri and the rest of them. We were so strong and I am so proud of that generation that etched their names in the history of the club.”
