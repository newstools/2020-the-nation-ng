 The Federal High Court sitting in Lagos yesterday restrained the Minister of Petroleum Resources and Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) from revoking the Ororo Marginal Field in OML 95 pending the determination of the substantive suit. Justice Muslim Sule Hassan granted the order of interim injunction against the respondents following a May 19 motion ex parte filed by Owena Oil and Gas Ltd. He ordered the parties to maintain status quo concerning the revocation pending the determination of the Motion on Notice and adjourned till June 10 for hearing.  The Ororo field, discovered in 1986, is located within OML 95 in shallow waters offshore Ondo State. It lies in water depths ranging between 23ft and 27 ft. Owena, in suit FHC/L/CS/587/2020 filed through its counsel Kemi Pinheiro (SAN), said the first and second respondents “purportedly revoked the Ororo Maginal Field without recourse to the plaintiff.” It contended that it would suffer “irreparable damage unless the defendants are restrained.” Justice Hassan upheld the argument.
