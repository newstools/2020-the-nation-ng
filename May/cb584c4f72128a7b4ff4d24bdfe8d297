THE Premier League has agreed a £4m deal with the Hong Kong biotechnology company Prenetics to provide coronavirus testing for players and staff, which is due to start next week. Premier League footballers are scheduled to start being tested for coronavirus on Thursday, with clubs told to expect their results in just 24 hours, sparking further controversy over Project Restart.  The speed at which players can expect to receive their results is certain to raise questions among essential workers, including those in the NHS and social care, plus anyone aged over 65 with symptoms, who are all advised to wait between 48 and 72 hours for results from the UK government’s testing scheme.
