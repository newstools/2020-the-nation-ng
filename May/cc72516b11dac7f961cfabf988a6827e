 AS a part of measures to find a cure to COVID-19 pandemic, an educationist and Chancellor of the Oduduwa University, Ipetumodu, Osun State, Dr. Ramon Adedoyin, has urged the Federal Government to encourage Nigerian scientists and researchers to explore the use of local herbs in the treatment of Coronavirus. Adedoyin made the appeal while fielding questions from reporters in Ife, Osun State. The educationist disclosed that he was setting up a research institute inside the Oduduwa University immediately and had earmarked $50,000 for this purpose alone. According to Adedoyin, before the advent of orthodox medicine, Africans had been using traditional herbs to treat different ailments and diseases successfully, adding that COVID-19 was not an exception. He advised the Nigerian government to look inwards and try to find internal and homegrown solution to the disease rather than wait for solutions from the western world, which may not come anytime soon. He made reference to some African countries like Madagascar which recently launched a drug which the country claimed can prevent and cure patients suffering from COVID-19 as a result of research by the Malagasy Institute of Applied Research. “I am setting up a research institute inside the Oduduwa University immediately and has earmarked $50,000 for this purpose alone.”
