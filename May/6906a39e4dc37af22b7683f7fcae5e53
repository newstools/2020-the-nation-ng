He also appealed to parents not to allow their children to embark on visitation during the Salalh celebration, pointing out that such attitude is against the COVID-19 protocols. The Chief Imam also prayed for the peace and progress of Kano and Nigeria. The Nation reports that Hisbah officials were on hand to ensure that worshippers complied with the COVID-19 protocols.
