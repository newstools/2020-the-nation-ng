Five persons have been confirmed dead while several others sustained various degrees of injuries in a renewed clash between farmers and herdsmen in Nasarawa State. The skirmishes took place at a border community in Keana Local Government Area of the state at the weekend. A source told our correspondent that the problem started when some Fulani herders beat up a woman in the farm, and overpowered a man who came to rescue her. “Tiv youths on a vengeance mission clashed with the Fulani men who fled but later returned to kill two women,” the source said. The Nasarawa State chairman of Meyatti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN), Hussaini Mohammed, on his part, said three of his men were killed in the clash. Keana council chair Adamu Adi Giza confirmed the attacks, adding that the council was doing something about them.
