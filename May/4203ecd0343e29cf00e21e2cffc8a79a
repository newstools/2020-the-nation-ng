President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the termination of appointment of Prof Charles Uwakwe as the Registrar and Chief Executive of the National Examinations Council (NECO). The Presidentâ€™s directive was conveyed in a letter, dated May 11 and signed by the Permanent Secretary in the Federal Ministry of Education, Sonny Echono, on behalf of the Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu. President Buhari also dismissed four members of the management for various offences bordering on financial impropriety. Abubakar Gana had been appointed as the acting Registrar of the council since 2018 when Uwakwe was suspended. In the letter, Uwakwe was accused of violating the Public Procurement Act (2007) and pursuant to PSR 030402 and Part 1 schedule 4 (i) of NECO Establishment Act. He was suspended in May 2018 by the Federal Ministry of Education, the parent ministry of the agency, for alleged financial mismanagement and abuse of office. It was alleged that Uwakwe and some top officials of the council allegedly awarded contracts to the tune of N25 billion without following due process. NECO, in a statement on Wednesday by its Head of Information and Public Relations Division, Mr. Azeez Sani, confirmed that the suspended Registrar had been relieved of his appointment by the President, while four members of the management had also been dismissed.
