Inspector-general of Police Mohammed Adamu has ordered the withdrawal of six policemen attached to chairman of Five Star Group, Emeka Okonkwo, also called E-Money. It was gathered that the withdrawal was informed by what was termed “misuse” of the policemen. Police spokesman Bala Elkana confirmed the development but said he had no details on it. “It is true that his escorts have been withdrawn and an investigation ongoing. I do not have much information on it,” said Elkana. Adamu reportedly directed the Lagos police command to investigate the billionaire’s sources of income following allegations that he used his police escorts like domestic servants. The escorts are said to carry umbrellas and handbags in addition to doing other menial jobs for E-Money and his household. The billionaire, known for his philanthropy, is often pictured flaunting his luxury cars and palatial homes.
