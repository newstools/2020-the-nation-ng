Inspector-General Mohammed Adamu has urged essential workers not to take undue advantage of their exemption from the national curfew and inter-state movement restriction orders emplaced by the Federal Government to contain COVID-19 spread. A statement by the Force Public Relations Officer, Frank Mba, a Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), on Wednesday evening noted that they were not oblivious of “the sensitive, indispensable, patriotic and frontline role of the nation’s workforce that falls within the category of Essential Service Providers particularly as it relates to efforts to curtail and contain the COVID-19 pandemic.” The statement reads: “Meanwhile, the IGP enjoins all workers who fall within these categories not to take undue advantage of their positions and privileges to advance other purposes not connected with the performance of their duties within the stated period.” Mba said following unending inquiries on the status of essential workers in respect of the due enforcement of the national curfew and inter-state movement restriction orders, it has become necessary to clear all ambiguity on the position of the Nigeria Police Force, especially as it relates to persons on essential duties.
