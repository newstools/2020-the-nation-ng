 THE political dimension in Oyo State is becoming interesting every day. The Omituntun Revolution is still trying to find its feet such that it is difficult to say exactly who is in charge. Constitutionally, Governor Seyi Makinde (GSM) is the elected leader but he is now at the mercy of the Governor’s Advisory Committee (GAC) which he constituted to help his administration. GAC is now operating as a parallel authority, to the extent that some of its members are now tin gods. They determine who gets any appointment in the state through their “strong recommendation.” Also, those seeking political and business favours now sleep at the doorsteps of some GAC members. Still undone, some ambitious GAC members are already working on the 2023 project without factoring GSM into their calculations. Yet, the excesses of these reckless members have not been checked. The question in Oyo State is: Who is really in charge? GSM or GAC?
