 AN auxiliary nurse with a private hospital in Okpoko, near Onitsha, Anambra state, Miss Chinwendu Okafor has refuted video clips alleging she stole a baby and was caught attempting to sell it in the Upper Iweka area of the commercial city. The viral video showed an angry mob attempting to lynch the nurse on suspicion of child trafficking. But Okafor told reporters that she was devastated by calls from friends and family members who watched the video. She called on both government and security agents to carry out a detailed investigation into the matter in order to exonerate her tarnished reputation by the trending video.
