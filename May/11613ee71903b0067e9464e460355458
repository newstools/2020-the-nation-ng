LaLiga has confirmed that five players have tested positive for coronavirus. All five unnamed players – across the leagues top two divisions – are asymptomatic and in the final phase of the disease but will now go into quarantine and be unable to return to group training until they have had two negative tests. The Spanish league resumed group training this week with a view to resuming their league in June. A LaLiga statement read: “After completing the medical tests on the minimum essential personnel referred by the clubs to start training, some cases of COVID-19 have been detected. “Specifically, between the clubs of LaLiga Santander and La Liga SmartBank, five positive cases have been detected in players, all of them asymptomatic and in the final phase of the disease.” The statement added: “As planned, the next steps with people who have taken a stand for COVID-19 are: To remain in quarantine in their homes, carrying out the same individual physical activity that they have been doing until now, following the instructions of the club, for those who are footballers. “In the next few days they will be tested again for the Covid-19 and, after obtaining two negative results, they will be able to join the training sessions at their club’s facilities.” “In addition, LaLiga will offer people who live with those affected the possibility of also doing screening tests.” Elsewhere in England, a third Brighton player has tested positive for coronavirus and the unnamed player will go into 14-day isolation while he recovers from the virus. Two other players, whose names have also not been revealed by the club, contracted the virus earlier in the pandemic, but are understood to have since recovered.
