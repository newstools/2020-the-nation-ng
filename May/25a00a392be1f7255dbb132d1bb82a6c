GEORGINA RODRIGUEZ gives her pet cat the best spot in the house as Cristiano Ronaldo’s girlfriend cradles it under her top in a new video which is bound to lead to fresh pregnancy speculation. The stunning 26-year-old became an adopted mum to her four-legged friend as it dozed on her chest on her leopard-print sofa. She picked a song called Mami by Romeo Santos as the soundtrack for her new Instagram Live footage – and at one point appeared to pat her stomach. Georgina posted the video just days after uploading a picture of the scary-looking hairless Sphynx cat alongside a new enigmatic ‘Baby Girl’ message.  The model dressed it up as a baby and took a picture of it being kissed by Cristiano’s two-year-old son Mateo as he clutched a doll. She posted the snap alongside the caption ‘Baby girl’ by a heart wrapped in a bow, the same words and emoji she used earlier this month to illustrate a photo of her chewing gum which first sparked pregnancy rumours. All the more intriguing, Georgina has previously revealed the cat’s name is Pepe, which is a man’s name. The former shop worker was the subject of speculation she was pregnant in June 2018 while she was at a swimwear fashion week in Gran Canaria, a month after she and Cristiano shared a photo on Instagram of him with his hand on her belly. She denied she was expecting again in a subsequent interview with glossy Spanish magazine Hola!, but added: “In the future we would like to add to our family.”
