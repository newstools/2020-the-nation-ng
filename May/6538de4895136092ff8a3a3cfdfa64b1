Senior Staff Association of Electricity and Allied Companies( SSAEAC) has hailed the Federal Government over the removal of the former Managing Director of the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), Usman Gur Mohammed. It described it as a prompt action that will serve the interest of the nation.
The union, in a letter to the Presidency signed by it General Secretary, Umar Abubakar Dubagari, said: “We commended Your Excellency’s approval for the removal of Usman Gur Mohammed as the Managing Director. “There were sundry and repeated actions of his to have done that long ago, including incompetence, indiscipline, impunity, non-compliance to rules, confrontation of his supervisors, open quarrel with other operators and financial malfeasance. “His removal has liberated the suppressed staff of TCN who were performing sub-optimally on account of his tyranny and misdemeanors.” The union said it was aware that the approval for the sack of Mohammed was graciously granted by the President and duly conveyed to the Minister of Power through the Chief of Staff. Furthermore, it described as disingenuous a recent memo from the SGF office attempting to stop ministers from removing heads of public agencies. The union said: “For the avoidance of doubt, the role of the SGF is mainly advisory and policy coordination. “So far, beyond delegated duties, there are more than ten agencies directly domiciled under the alleged supervision of the SGF and where he can exercise his power as he so wishes” the union said. The union urged the presidency to carry out thorough investigation on the activities of the former Managing Director, while he was heading the TCN. The union also urged the Presidency to direct the Ministers of Labour and Power to implement Senior and Junior Staff Classification fully in the power sector.
