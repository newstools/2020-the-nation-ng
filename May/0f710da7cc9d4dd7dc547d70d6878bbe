 A distribution company, the Port Harcourt Electricity Distribution (PHED) Plc, has said there was no time it contemplated switching off power supply in Rivers State following the arrest of its officials by the the state government taskforce on COVID-19. The company’s officials, who were on essential duties during the 24-hour lockdown in Port Harcourt, were arrested by the taskforce and sent to an isolation centre leading to reports that the Disco would retaliate by switching off power supply. But the company’s Manager, Corporate Communications, John Onyi, denied such reports saying PHED remained unwavering in its commitment to deliver electricity to its customers. “Therefore, there is no iota of truth that PHED was contemplating to throw Port Harcourt into darkness as that would be foreign to the core values that PHED stands for. “PHED as a major player in the electricity industry value chain will not embark on any action that will cause displeasure or discomfort to its esteemed customers and the general public as a whole. Our role and responsibility, as always, is to ensure that we offer necessary support as much as we can during this period of covid-19 pandemic” he said. He, however, appealed to all state security agencies in the company’s area of operations to accord the firm’s employees all the support required to enable them perform their essential role in providing electricity to all. He said: “PHED will continue to render its services through efficient distribution of power supply to its valued customers in Rivers , Bayelsa, Cross River and Akwa Ibom states based on what it receives on daily basis from the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN)”. The company earlier assured customers that its workers would be on ground despite the spread of COVID-19 pandemic to deliver service.
