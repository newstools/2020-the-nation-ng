Police in Rivers State have confirmed the arrest of a middle-aged woman, simply identified as Chinyere, for allegedly abducting her neighbourâ€™s two-year-old baby. The incident reportedly happened on Tuesday in the D-Line area of Port Harcourt. Police spokesman Nnamdi Omoni, who confirmed the development to The Nation yesterday, said two men were also arrested in connection with the incident. Omoni, who said the suspects would be taken to court after investigations, added that the rescued two-year-old victim has been reunited with her family. A source said the suspects drugged the baby, put her in a zipped box and proceeded to a motor park before they ran out of luck. The Nation gathered that upon interrogation by police, Chinyere confessed that the child was drugged and put in a box. The baby was brought out of the box at the motor park sweating and crying, it was learnt.
