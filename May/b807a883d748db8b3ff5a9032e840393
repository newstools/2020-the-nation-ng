Spain’s La Liga will resume on 11 June with next season starting on 12 September, said  the league’s president Javier Tebas. On Monday, Tebas said a behind closed doors derby between Real Betis and Sevilla could restart the campaign. “We’re prepared and the important thing will be the day we finish the league,” Tebas told Spanish newspaper Marca. Tebas also said audiovisual testing is being carried out so fans have a choice of different viewing experiences. Those watching at home can choose between two options – the real “silence” from the stadiums or “simulation of the crowds” with noises being played.  On Saturday, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez gave permission for the country’s top two divisions to resume from 8 June. La Liga players started training in groups of no more than 10 last week. Football in Spain was suspended on 12 March because of the Coronavirus pandemic and Tebas said the next objective was to progress to full training. Champions Barcelona lead La Liga by two points from Real Madrid with 11 matches remaining. On Thursday, the Premier League announced it will return to action on 17 June with 92 fixtures still to be played.
