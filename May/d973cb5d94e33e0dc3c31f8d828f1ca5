Television drama queen, Jaiye Kuti, has broken down over the death of a radio show host, Dare Best Alabi. Kuti couldn’t control her emotions as she took to her social media handles to eulogise Best Alabi, a radio host and anchor of the Yoruba programme, ‘Oju Abe,’ on Faaji FM. Pouring out her sadness and shock over Best-Alabi’s death, the ‘Agbelebu’ actress wrote, “Goodbye dear friend. My first friend in the Industry. Words fail me right now. If I knew you’d be dead, I would have called to say goodbye. You’ll greatly be missed my darling. I can’t control my tears as I flashback to when we walked the road of Lagos with my brother Samson looking for where they do auditions. “He introduced me to many production houses because he believed in me. Face2face, Beg your pardon by NTA, Galaxy TV, LTV, MiTV, Orisun TV, etc also many movies that I have done. My first movie ‘Ewon Laafin’ by Adekaz /Almoruf we did together,” she reminisced. Continuing, Kuti wrote, “14yrs ago, he said Jaiye you have a place here please stay!!! And I said o sure? He smiled and said I see a star in you; I smiled and hoped that was true. Now here we are. How did I not know you’ll be gone quickly… Words fail me… “He was a good guy. May God forgive all your sins and Rest in peace my darling Dare. Olatunji mi owon,” she concluded her eulogy. Best-Alabi passed away on May 18, 2020, in Abeokuta after a brief illness that only lasted a week. Best-Alabi, before his death, was one of Nigeria’s cool-headed and down-to-earth broadcasters. He kicked off his career at Eko FM after which he joined Yotomi TV in its hay days and later went into music video making with over 40 music videos to his credit. He last worked with Faaji FM as an independent radio and show host.
