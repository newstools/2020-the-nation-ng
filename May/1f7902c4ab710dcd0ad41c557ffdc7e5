 THE Federal Government has donated 130 trailers of grains to Kano State as part of effort to cushion the effect of lockdown on residents. The Minister for Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Hajia Sadiya Umar Farouq, made this known during the handing over of the relief materials to the government on Sunday. The Minister said she was in Kano on behalf of the President, to commiserate with the people over the recent loss of their loved ones, and to handover the relief materials to the state. “Your Excellency, I have found my way today to the ancient city of Kano for one major reason; to stand in solidarity with the people and government of Kano State as we battle the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and the humanitarian crisis it is leaving in its wake,” she said. “My condolences go the Kano Emirate Council over the loss of Dan Iyan Kano, Alhaji Yusuf Bayero and Professor Tijjani Hashim, Jarman Kano. I also wish to express my condolences to Rano Emirate Council and the family of the late Emir of Rano, Dr. Abubakar Tafida Ila II. May the souls of all the departed rest in peace,” she added. She prayed for the quick recovery of all those currently recuperating from Covid-19, including the doctors and other health workers of the Mallam Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, who contracted the disease in the course of their heroic service.
