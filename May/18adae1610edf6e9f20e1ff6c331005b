 A kingpin of Ghana’s U-20 World Cup-winning team, Gladson Awako has revealed that Nigerian famous prophet, TB Joshua was the brain behind their success in Egypt. The West African country became the first country to conquer the continent and the world to win the U-20 World Cup. After a difficult start of the tournament, Sellas Tetteh and his boys made the cut to the finals and faced tournament favourite, Brazil in the finals. However, Ghana defeated the South Americans side on penalties with Emmanuel Agyemang Badu scoring the winner.  According to the Great Olympics skipper, TB Joshua told them everything about the tournament and it exactly came to pass. Awako revealed that a man spoke to the entire team but did not know the person until the end of the tournament. “During the U-20 World Cup in Egypt in 2009, we normally gathered around the centre to pray,” Awako said in an interview with YAC Media Production via Instagram Live. “The coach usually made us speak to a man on phone. He will put the phone on loudspeaker so we could all hear and then pray and do what he says. “Most of the things he said came to pass especially the final. He predicted that we will get an early red card and also told us how we will arrange the penalty takers. All that came to pass. “Honestly, I didn’t know who it was until we won the cup and they told us the man was TB Joshua’, he added.
