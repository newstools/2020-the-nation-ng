The United States women’s football team’s bid for equal pay has been dismissed by a court, with the judge rejecting the players’ claims they were underpaid compared to the men. The lawsuit was filed by 28 women’s national team players last year against the US Soccer Federation (USSF). They had been seeking $66m (£52.8m) in damages under the Equal Pay Act. Molly Levinson, the players’ spokeswoman, said that they planned to appeal against the decision. “We are shocked and disappointed,” said Levinson. “We will not give up our hard work for equal pay. “We are confident in our case and steadfast in our commitment to ensuring that girls and women who play this sport will not be valued as lesser just because of their gender.” Federal judge Gary Klausner allowed the players’ case for unfair treatment in travel, housing and medical support to go to trial, which is set for 16 June in Los Angeles. Giving its ruling, the court said: “The women’s team has been paid more on both a cumulative and an average per-game basis than the men’s team over the class period.”
