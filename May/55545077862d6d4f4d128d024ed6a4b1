 ORGANISERS of the Nigeria Pitch Awards are still optimistic of hosting the 7th edition of the glamorous award this year irrespective of the on-going spread of COVID-19 pandemic. Chief Executive Officer of the Pitch Award Shina Philips said plans were underway to stage the event in line with the social distancing guideline of the Federal government. “This year’s EURO Cup and the 2020 Olympics due to hold this summer in Tokyo had been put off,” Philips said. “All football, rugby, basketball Leagues in Europe, America, Asia and Africa have long been suspended with organisers considering declaring them inconclusive altogether. “Unfortunately, we had already scheduled the 7th Award Ceremony of the Nigeria Pitch Awards before the lockdown was announced. But like other international events, the pandemic had forced organizers to suspend the event. “For us as a responsible organisation, we could not have done otherwise. We felt we should abide by Government’s order and toe the line of all responsible organizations. The 7th edition of the awards was slated for March 30 in Asaba, Delta State but was put off because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
