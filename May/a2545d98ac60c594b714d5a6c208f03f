 Filmmaker Tunde Kelani has released a stage adaptation of ‘Palwine Drinkard’ on his YouTube channel. The stage adaptation of the 1952 novel published by Nigerian author, Amos Tutuola, was recorded during the presentation at the Lagos Black Heritage Festival in 2016. The stage adaptation premiered on his Youtube channel on Sunday, May 3. The septuagenarian, who is a promoter of Yoruba culture through his movies, took to his social media to announce his latest production. “Music, Dance, Comedy, Magic, and Drama – a hallmark of the golden era of the Yoruba Travelling Theatre. This latest adaptation of Palmwine Drinkard takes you on a riveting, entertaining journey even to the town of the dead!” he wrote. The ‘Palmwine Drinkard’ story is a classic quest tale in which the hero, a lazy boy who likes to spend his days drinking palm wine, gains wisdom, confronts death, and overcomes many perils in the course of his journey. Directed by Tunde Awosanmi and produced by Tunde Kelani, ‘Palwine Drinkard’ features Segun Adefila and choreographed by Dayo Liadi. Kelani once revealed in an interview that his influences come from everywhere in the world where culture is being celebrated. “I am a special case,” he said. “I have certainly been influenced by cinemas from everywhere – Hollywood, Polish, German, Russian, French, British, China, Indian, African but none of them experienced the Yoruba Travelling Theatre, especially in its golden years. Traces of this can be found in my cinema. I am most influenced by my cultural experience.” Known for his insatiable desire for knowledge, Kelani collaborated with Bola Bello to shoot a film titled, ‘Yoruba Without Border’ with a smartphone. The movie was screened at the iREP International Documentary Film Festival last year. The cinematographer has produced evergreen movies such as Saworo Ide, Agogo Eewo, Oleku, and Ti Oluwa Nile among others.
