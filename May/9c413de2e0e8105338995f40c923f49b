 NOLLYWOOD actor Adeniyi Johnson has stated that he never cheated on his ex-wife, Toyin Abraham with his current wife, Seyi ‘Shai’ Edun. Johnson, in an interview with Muka Ray on Instagram live, revealed that he never planned to marry Edun neither did he cheat on his ex-wife with her. In the interview, Johnson narrated that Edun used to follow him to his girlfriend’s house in Ibadan after his marriage with Abraham crashed. He said: “When people say we’ve been dating while I was still married to the former I just laugh it off. It never happened. Ignorant people think I cheated on my ex-wife, Toyin Abraham, with her colleague Seyi Edun. The truth is that Seyi used to follow me to the lady I dated after divorce with Toyin. Not knowing she will end up being my wife.” His comment, however, sparked off reactions from perceived fans of Abraham who lambasted him and accused Edun of being the source of the crashed marriage. The fans vented their anger on Johnson for speaking on his failed marriage with Abraham. Responding to comments, Johnson said he doesn’t give a damn as he has a thick skin to deal with criticism. Last year, on August 15, 2019 Adeniyi shocked many when he took to Abraham’s Instagram page to congratulate her on the arrival of her baby boy. Adeniyi Johnson and Toyin Abraham got married in 2015 but their marriage hit the rock barely 24 months after.
