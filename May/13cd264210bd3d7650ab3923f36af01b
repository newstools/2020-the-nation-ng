The crisis rocking Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Imo State is deepening as top officials resigned their positions. Its Publicity Secretary, Damien Opara, joined the gale of resignation on Thursday “on personal grounds.” Few days ago, the state chairman, Bar. Charles Ezekwem resigned his position. The ex- chairman, who has since joined the All Progressives Party (APC), accused a PDP chieftain of hijacking the party structure in the state. It was gathered that some top chieftains of the party are itching to abandon the party following what a source disclosed as “high-handedness of a governorship candidate.” The source also explained some of them resigned owing to issues that border on the last primaries. It was gathered the forms of the party for the primaries were hijacked by a group loyal to the former governorship candidate. The Nation also learnt the money realised from the sales of the forms cannot be accounted for many months after the primaries.
