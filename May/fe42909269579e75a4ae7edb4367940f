Despite divergent views by members of the National Council of Sports on Monday agreed the National Sport Festival to be staged in Edo State should be held this year. The event suffered postponement following the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic. But speaking during the virtual meeting chaired by the Minister of Youth and Sports Development Sunday Dare, contributors said although the COVID-19 pandemic was a source of concern, the Sports Festival can go ahead if certain measures were put in place. Edo State Deputy Governor and Chairman of the Local Organizing Committee Comrade Philip Shuaibu said: “We are ready to host the Festival, but other states may not be ready. The issue of health is something that we all take seriously. Isolation centres have been further expanded to bigger capacity. We have set up many testing centres that would screen athletes before and after games.” The Minister affirmed:” After more than more months of uncertainty, we need to chart a new course for our sports just like is been done globally. Our final decision will be based on consultations with the Ministry of Health and the National Task Force on COVID-19.” Meanwhile, an eleven-man committee has been set up to inspect all heath facilities for the games.
