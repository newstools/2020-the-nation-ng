 The mother of  late Captain of the Flying Eagles AliJeje Ibrahim, Hajia Khadija Inuwa Ali became the latest beneficiary of the largesse of the Minister of Youth and Sports, Sunday Dare, as she was given cash and food items at her Jos residence yesterday in Plateau State. The  Sports Minister, who was represented by former International Sam Pam Adamu Jr. said the gesture to Alijeje aged-mother was to appreciate  the immense contributions of her son to Nigerian Football. An elated Hajia Ali said she was surprised that the Minister could remember her years after the demise of her son. She said the Minister’s gesture not only lifted her spirit, but convinced her that her son did not labour in vain. She expressed delight that the gesture came at the right time during the Holy Month of Ramadan.” “May God bless the Minister Mr. Sunday Dare and the government for remembering me. That means my son did not labour in vain. God will reward the Minister for his kindness,” Hajia Ali said. AliJeje captained Nigeria to the World Youth Championship in Mexico in 1983, after leading the team to win the Africa Youth Championship, known as the Tesema Cup in the same year. He died on December 12th, 2007 following a brief illness.
