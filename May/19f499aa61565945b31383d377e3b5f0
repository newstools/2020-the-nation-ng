 General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) Pastor Enoch Adeboye has explained that the current lockdown occasioned by COVID-19 pandemic is a perfect example for Christians to do things that will move them forward. Declaring a sermon titled All things work together for good on Sunday during a broadcast on DOVE TV, Adeboye said God had used lockdown in the past to elevate His children. He mentioned David, Elijah and Joseph as biblical characters who experienced uplifting after lockdown. To make the best out of the current lockdown, Adeboye said Christians should rejoice, praise God and pray, stating “there has never been a better time to pray because you have more time and less things to do.”  He also asked Christians to study the word, meditate and receive vision for the future and plan towards actualising your future. The respected preacher further advised believers to clean their houses and environments because of more time on their hands and lighten their houses. According to him: “When you clean your house, you will realise things you don’t need anymore. Please give them out.” He finally asked Christians to pray for him and other leaders because the COVID-19 crisis would task a lot of them in no small measure.
