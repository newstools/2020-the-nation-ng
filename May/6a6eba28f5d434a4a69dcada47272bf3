 Two students of Usmanu Danfodiyo University, Sokoto (UDUS), Uchenna Emelife, and Mikail Rodiyah, have established Book O’Clock UDUS, a book club. The club, first of its kind in UDUS history, has since been unveiled with students already expressing interest to join. Uchenna Emelife, and Mikail Rodiyah said the initiative is to reignite and encourage the culture of reading and literacy among students of the institution. Speaking with CAMPUSLIFE, Emelife who is a 300-Level student of Literature in English, explained that he and his co-founder Omotoyosi, have been passionate about reading and sharing books with each other since their first year in school.  However Emelife said the absence of a platform for book lovers in UDUS campus, motivated them, to begin the initiative. He said:  “We knew that there were many students like us out there who hungered for the companionship book clubs provide. With Book O’clock UDUS however, they will find such companionship which will automatically promote the art of reading and literacy.” He said the club aims to entrench reading culture among UDUS students, while also giving readers an opportunity to express their love for books. He encouraged students to join the club which he described as a giant step for whoever is desirous of becoming an avid reader. His words: “The first step to being an avid reader is to read; and that’s what we do at Book O’Clock UDUS. Students should identify with us so they learn the art of reading; after all, readers are leaders.” “Members of Book O’clock UDUS enjoy a lot of privileges. Firstly, they will be provided books on a weekly basis. Secondly, through our book discussions, they learn how to critically assess books and form expert opinions about them. Thirdly, we are looking at hosting book readings of authors in future, so members can get to meet the authors of the books we provide and lots more.”
