 The Lagos State Branch of the Nigerian Medical Association(NMA) has directed its members to embark on an indefinite industrial action over alleged harassment by security agents. Lagos NMA Chairman, Dr Saliu Oseni and Secretary Dr Ramon Moronkola, issued the stay-at-home directive on Wednesday. Security agents were accused of stopping essential workers, including journalists and medical personnel from gaining access during the curfew imposed to contain spread of coronavirus. The NMA described the treatment meted out to its members on essential services as unacceptable and unjustifiable. It said the directive would take effect from 6.00 pm The medical body said: “We have observed that despite the directives of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, President Muhamadu Buhari, through the Presidential Taskforce on COVID 19, which was clear on the exemption of essential workers including doctors and other health workers from the ongoing lockdown/movement restrictions, (but) the Commissioner of Police in Lagos State, Mr. Hakeem Odumosu, has been issuing conflicting directives on social and mainstream media to the effect that essential workers, including doctors and other health workers, are NOT exempted.”
