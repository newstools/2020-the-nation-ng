Elder brother of the late Samuel Okwaraji, Patrick has commended the Sport Minister, Sunday Dare for the kind gesture he has shown towards Jane, the mother of the late Nigerian superstar. The Minister who was represented by Bamidele Ajayi recently donated food items and provisions as well as cash gift of N50,000 to late Okwaraji’s mother in Abakpa-Nike in Enugu. Patrick who regretted that her mother could not receive the items personally because she was slightly indisposed, expressed the family’s appreciation for the kind gesture. He lauded the minister for his effort noting that such efforts in the past had failed. Earlier, the Minister explained that the gesture was to assist the aged mother and as a mark of honour for the contribution of the  former Dinamo Zagreb  forward to Nigerian football which remains indelible years after his death. “I have always been drawn to greatness and I admire people who live their lives to elevate the status of their community and nation,” the minister was quoted as saying. “Okwaraji was not just a footballer; he was an icon and great patriot. “He was a great professional who redefined football in Nigeria with many young talents benefiting from his ingenuity and sacrifices by re-writing   our country name in gold in world football.”
