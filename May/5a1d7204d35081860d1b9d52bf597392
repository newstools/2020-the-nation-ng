  THE Office of the Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice in Rivers State yesterday convicted 170 violators of the state’s lockdown order. The offenders, who breached the restriction order in Port Harcourt and Obio/Akpor local government areas, were arraigned before the Port Harcourt Mobile Courts sitting at General Yakubu Gowon Stadium, Elekahia. The government accused them of violating the state’s Executive Order RVSG 06, 2020, which imposes complete lockdown and prohibits human and vehicular movement in Port Harcourt City and Obio/Akpor local government areas. Justice Commissioner Emmanuel C. Aguma urged the residents of the two local government areas to comply with the Executive Order and other extant regulations to avoid prosecution. Also, Oyo State Command of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) arrested 63 motorists for violating social distancing order. The state’s FRSC Sector Commander, Mrs. Chukwurah Uche, stated this on Thursday in Ibadan, the state capital, in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). “Micra taxi cars are not allow to carry more than one passenger in front and two at the back. Tricycles are to carry two passengers only at the back while motorcycles must carry only one passenger. “The buses are to carry half of their passenger capacity; that is, two on each row and one in the front. “Anyone caught violating this order will be issued a ticket and we will insist that the extra persons in the vehicle come down. That is why you see little compliance in the state,” Uche said. In Ekiti State, the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) on Thursday intercepted a bus which sneaked into the state with some traders.
