 As part of measure to curtail community spread of the dreaded coronavirus pandemic, the Ekiti State government would next week begin random testing for residents across the 16 Council Areas of the state. The Commissioner for Health, Dr. Mojisola Yaya-Kolade made this disclosure in Ado Ekiti, on Wednesday while giving update on the Covid-19 report in the state. Yaya-kolade said the random testing which must be undertaken in view of the geometric increase in number of Covid-19 victims, will not be done by coercion, but through sensitisation and volition. Yaya-Kolade revealed that the state would soon set up a molecular laboratory to boost the state’s testing capacity , so that many people can know their statuses and be aware of their safety. The Commissioner stated that the state presently has only five patients in the isolation centre, which she said are stable, responding to treatment and assymptomatic . “We are still tracing some contacts and we are expecting our molecular laboratory soon just as we are still preaching prevention and containment through usage of masks and keep to personal hygiene and social financing. “We will begin random testing next week to stop community spread. The state is doing a lot of infection prevention training for our health workers to.make our people safe. “We are also thinking about complying with the new NCDC regulation that you can discharge after first negative, if you are overburdened will patients. But we are going to be cautious in applying this. “Those coming through the borders should stay away. They are not wanted here, because many of the cased we have had were brought from outside.”
