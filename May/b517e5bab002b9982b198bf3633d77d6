In certain states like Lagos, Kano, and even in the FCT, we are taking the test a lot closer to the community because of the intensity of transmission in those states. “In those states, the states are identifying hotspot areas and based on these identifications, intensifying testing in those communities. “We haven’t gotten to the stage of drawing community testing across the country. We are doing targeted hotspot areas identified by states.”
