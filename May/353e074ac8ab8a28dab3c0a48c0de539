 Rembers of the Ondo State House of Assembly have denied speculations that they have begun impeachment process against Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu over the discovery of the N4.3billion hidden in a bank account. They said they have a robust relationship with the executive arm of the government, adding that the speculation was to cause disaffection between the two arms. The Chairman of the House Committee on Information, Olugbenga Omole, in a statement after plenary, denied reports that the residential quarters of the Speaker, Bamidele Oleyelogun, was besieged by the security operatives.  The statement said:  “There was no plan to commence impeachment moves against Governor Akeredolu. “The news making the rounds that the Speaker’s lodge was under siege is a hoax and the imagination of those behind it. “The lodge was never under siege. The armed policemen sighted there were at some distance away and were there to maintain peace, law and order. “On the issue of the N4.3billion under scrutiny, relevant documents should be submitted to the Committee on Public Account and Committee on Finance and Appropriation.”
