President of Imo state Town Associations in Lagos (ISTDAL) Chief Chris Ekeocha has appealed to Lagos state government to lend its support to Igbo traders to enable them bounce back after the huge losses suffered as a result of the Coronavirus lockdown. Ekeocha in a statement noted that Igbo traders were worst-hit by the economic effects of Coronavirus pandemic. “If government fails to come to the aid of these traders, most of them risk going out of business. My appeal to the Lagos state government is to find a way of helping these traders. Giving them tax rebates would go a long way. These are people that have been contributing to the economic growth and development of Lagos state. Leaving them in the lush at these very trying period wouldn’t be the best.” Ekeocha urged the traders and all other businessmen and women to abide by the protocol of government and health authorities as government prepares to open up the economy.
