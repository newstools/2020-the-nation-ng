Unknown armed gunmen have kidnapped five people in Gutarrinda village in Dnakudna district of Shiroro Local Government Area of Niger State. Those abducted include two women, two young girls between 19 and 20 years and a 15 year old boy. The attack occurred at 12 midnight yesterday morning. This attack is coming barely 48 hours after the state governor inaugurated a 15-man Community Policing Advisory Committee to checkmate incessant cases of insecurity in the state. According to a source close to the village, the midnight attack was perpetrated by about 20 heavily armed gunmen who shot sporadically to announce their arrival to the village. It was gathered that the gunmen went house to house to pick their victims. The 57 year old father of the two kidnapped girls also received a beating of his life when he tried to resist the abduction of his two daughters. The villagers, afraid that the gunmen will return for additional victims, fled the village after the attack. Shiroro Local Government Area has been venue of many attacks from gunmen, kidnappers and armed bandits in the past two years.
