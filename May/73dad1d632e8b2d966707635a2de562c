 THE Caretaker Committee of the Ekiti State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has urged former governor Ayodele Fayose and Senator Biodun Olujimi to sheathe their swords and work for the party’s progress. The two political gladiators have been at loggerheads over who controls the soul of the party and its architectural structures ahead of the 2022 governorship election. The committee, in a statement in Ado-Ekiti by its Secretary, Diran Odeyemi, after its inaugural meeting, urged loyalists of the two factions to embrace peace in the interest of the party. It vowed to broker peace between the factions and ensure unity among PDP members. The committee, which said it would work with stakeholders across the 177 wards as directed by the National Working Committee   (NWC),  as  well as the caretaker committees in the 16 local councils, added that it would meet stakeholders in the party soon.
