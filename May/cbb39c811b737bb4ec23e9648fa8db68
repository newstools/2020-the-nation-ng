The Majority Leader of Lagos State House of Assembly and the member representing Ikorodu Constituency 1, Hon. Bolanle Agunbiade, has announced that he and his wife, Yeye Airat Agunbiade, are out of the 14 day mandatory isolation meant for returnees into the country as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic. In a press statement he issued and personally signed on Saturday, he added that he is fully back to legislative duties. Agunbiade was among Nigerians that returned from the United Arab Emirates two weeks ago. While thanking friends, colleagues and relatives for their concern while he was away, he expressed gratitude to God that he and his wife tested negative twice to COVID-19 after undergoing test in Dubai and in Nigeria. “I have since returned home to re-unite with my family after my wife and I have again tested negative to the pandemic virus and got certified by the Federal Ministry of health as free of the deadly virus. The quarantine period is a sober experience that assisted in building confidence needed to mingle freely with one’s family and also encourages acceptability to one’s home and community without any hesitation,” he said. Describing the pandemic Coronavirus as a deadly disease, he urged Nigerians to be ready to fight and win the battle against it. “With what my experience has taken me through, I affirm that the COVID-19 virulence is real and we must try separately and severely to keep safe by obeying all the precautions set out by NCDC,” he said. The Opomulero of Ikorodu Kingdom felicitated with Muslims in his Constituency, Lagos State and Nigeria at large on the success of this year’s Ramadan. He urged Muslims in particular and Nigerians generally to continue to seek God’s intervention in the global crisis.
