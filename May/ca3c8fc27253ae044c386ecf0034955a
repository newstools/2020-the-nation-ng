In compliance with the Executive Order on the Ease of Doing Business as well as proactive response to the challenges of COVID-19 pandemic, National Agency for Food, Drug Administration and Control [NAFDAC] has instituted palliatives for the micro and small businesses.  NAFDAC is doing this via reduction in registration fees, and assisted E-registration through NAFDAC Automated Product Administration and Monitoring System (NAPAMS). The MSMEs palliative program will run concurrently in the six geo-political zones plus FCT and Lagos State. The Director-General NAFDAC,  Prof  Christianah Adeyeye, at a virtual launch on Friday to kick start the  programme,  said the palliative will offer “zero tariffs for first 200 micro and small companies to register their products from the launch day.” She added, “80% reduction in tariffs for the registration of micro and small enterprises products for a period of three months and also to give waivers on administrative charges for late renewal of expired licenses for products of micro and small businesses.” The DG NAFDAC also enjoined the industry to support NAFDAC by adhering to the Agency’s laws, regulations and guidelines in the course of doing business to ensure quality standards and safety.
