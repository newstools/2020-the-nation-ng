 THE founder and General Overseer of the Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN), Prophet T. B. Joshua, has said events like the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) occur once every 100 years. The cleric said God revealed to him that hard times will follow immediately after the lockdown, advising everyone to cut their coat according to their cloth. He said to survive, some may have to “withdraw from the city to a rural life or to do away with some of your properties”. Joshua, who spoke during a live service on Emmanuel TV on Sunday, said those who adjust to the new condition of things will be able to overcome while those who fail to do so may “go down with the times, either by disappointment, failure, death”. But he urged people not to give up, saying: “Sometimes God allows situations like this – I mean disappointment or something more serious – so that you can take your proper position and possessions. “Ask your family members to cut their coat according to their cloth. If any of them was living big before, they have to prepare to adjust now to the situation that is coming. Check your store and bring out the things you may need to sell. Right now, you need to be living modestly. “…Something must happen every 100 years to affect the whole world. This is what has happened in our own lifetime. It has been like that for generations. “Those who respond to the demands of the age will end up as overcomers, victors, winners. However, those who fail to respond to the demands appropriately will eventually go down with the times, either by disappointment, failure, or death. It is unchangeable; it must happen.” According to him, the prophecy will begin to manifest from June. “By the end of June to the first week of July, this will begin to become a point of reference: ‘This man said this; that man said it’ but it is God that said it,” Joshua added.
