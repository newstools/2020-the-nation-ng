 A Deputy governor in one of the states is in trouble for not coordinating the COVID-19 containment campaign well. Following the release of a N250 million vote for the purchase of basic items to curtail the pandemic, His Excellency wasted no time in transferring the cash to a woman’s account. The state is still waiting for the supply of the essential medical supplies. The attitude of the  deputy governor has forced the state to lag behind in anti-COVID-19 campaign.
