 KADUNA State Government has re-adjusted the two-day window of the restriction of movement order. This is to allow residents to purchase food and other essentials from markets. A statement by the Managing Director of Kaduna Markets Development and Management Company (KMDMC), Muhammad Hafiz Bayero on Sunday, said, Wednesdays  and Thursdays are now  the two-day window which the restriction of movement will be  relaxed. ‘’Residents will be free to visit their neighbourhood markets on 20th and 21st May 2020 to purchase food and other essential items. This adjustment means that no market will be open next Saturday,’’ he clarified. Beyero emphasized that the temporary neighbourhood markets are to operate from 10am to 4pm on the two days on which the restriction of movement is relaxed. He appealed for compliance with the set guideline, and other conditions including the need to wear facemasks and submit to temperature checks before entering the markets, adding that physical distancing and  other public health protocols should be complied with.
