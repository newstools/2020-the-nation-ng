Special Adviser on Media and Publicity to President Muhammadu Buhari, Femi Adesina, has disclosed the Presidency has caught up with an insider who leaked the President’s speech on Monday. Adesina, in his weekly column “From The Inside” described the person responsible for the leak as an “enemy of the state.” A draft copy of the presidential speech delivered nationwide by 8pm had been circulating in social media as early as 4pm. The draft was however strikingly full of errors though it was almost the same with the copy Buhari eventually read. Adesina, enraged by the leak, responded in his column titled “Enemy of the state.” According to him: “Well, an Enemy of the State struck in Nigeria on Monday, but this time, it was no fiction. “It was real life act of sabotage from somebody who does not wish his own country well at all, and who derived a sinister kind of pleasure from undermining the system. He added: “I took a look at the circulating document, and within one minute, I knew that it was a rogue copy. “I made a few phone calls to those of us involved with the script, right from origination, which was from outside the Presidency, to final editing, which I did, and the conclusion was easy to reach. “Who would do such a thing, except an Enemy of the State, someone who wants to ridicule the government? “But he forgot that in these days of technology, almost everything leaves a trail. “Before the end of that evening, computer evidence had narrowed down the suspect, and he was already answering for his evil action.”
