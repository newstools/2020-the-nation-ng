 An Ondo State based pastor, Kolawole Samson, has been sentenced to death by hanging for killing one Ayo Olaniyi at a village near Okeigbo area of the state. The late Olaniyi was said to have in March 2016, gone to hunt frogs alongside three others at a fish pond owned by Pastor Kolawole. Pastor Kolawole was sentenced to death by an Ondo state High Court sitting in Akure presided over by Justice Ademola Bola. Kolawole was found guilty of inflicting injury on the deceased’s head with a cutlass. The deceased later died at a hospital he was admitted.  Prosecuting Counsel, Mr Olusegun Akeredolu and Mrs Omotola Ologun, argued that the offence was contrary to Section 316 and punishable under Section 319 of the Criminal Code, Cap 37, Laws of Ondo State (2006). Mother of the deceased was one the witnesses called to testify during trial. Pastor Kolawole however pleaded not guilty to the charges. Justice Bola however ruled that all evidence before the court showed that Pastor Kolawole was guilty of killing Olaniyi. The judge held that Samson Kolawole should die by hanging.
