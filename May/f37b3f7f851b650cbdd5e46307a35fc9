An orphan, Osasere Ohonba, has petitioned the Assistant Inspector-General of Police (AIG), Zone 5, Benin, Edo State, Paul Yakadi, to protect him from a land grabber (name withheld) and his police backers in the state. Ohonba, Thursday in the petition through his counsel, Osamwonyi Ibude, stated that he was being intimidated, harassed and conspired against by the land grabber, in connivance with some police officers at the Esigie Police Division in Benin, in their attempt to frame him up. The petitioner noted that his problem started on the discovery that his late father’s large expanse of land in Ekhator Village, Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area of Edo State was encroached upon by the land grabber and his police allies, thereby selling many plots of the land to innocent buyers. Ohonba said: “A case of forcible entry and illegal sale of land from Ogiso Street and Ihinmwinwin Quarters, Benin were reported. The AIG, zone 5 demanded the land’s documents to confirm ownership, which were submitted. “When the land grabber and his collaborators were asked by the AIG to produce their title documents, they had none. “While the matter is still before the AIG, the land grabber instructed one of his buyers to go back to site and continue with his development, which was resisted and it led to an attack on me. “I am a law-abiding citizen, who will not want to take the law into my own hands, despite the unprovoked attack and planned frame up for trying to reclaim my father’s landed property.” The petitioner also pleaded with the AIG to wade into the matter and bring the land grabber and his cohorts to justice, as well as call to order the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) of Esigie police division, Benin and his men, who were involved in the land grabbing.
