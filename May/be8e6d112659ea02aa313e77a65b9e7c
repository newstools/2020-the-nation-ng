World heavyweight champion Tyson Fury said Anthony Joshua ‘isn’t dangerous at all’ and has compared his rival to a ‘big cuddly baby’. Fury and Joshua are on course for an all-British heavyweight dust-up, with the pair holding all five of the division’s reputable belts.  They have been tipped to meet later this year or at the start of 2021, with Fury likely to be the favourite after he stopped Deontay Wilder in seven rounds in February to relieve him of his WBC belt. When asked about the prospect of facing Joshua, the 31-year-old insisted he had no fears and made fun of AJ’s defeat by Andy Ruiz. Joshua lost to his less-fancied opponent in June last year before winning their rematch in February.
