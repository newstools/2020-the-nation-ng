Italian giants Napoli have entered the race to sign Arsenal target Emmanuel Dennis as the Italians prioritise landing the Club Brugge star over Lille’s Victor Osimhen. Nigeria international Dennis has impressed with his Belgian side this season, having caught the eye of English fans during his performances against Manchester United in the Europa League. The 22-year-old has played 103 games for Brugge since joining in 2017 from Zorya Luhansk, scoring 28 goals and providing 10 assists. Dennis has been linked with a move to the Premier League this summer, with Arsenal appearing to be the frontrunners to land the tricky forward for around £22million. Earlier this month, Brugge manager Philippe Clement said it was ‘very likely’ his star would leave.  It is reported that Newcastle, Brighton, Sheffield United, Watford, Monaco and Sampdoria are also eyeing a move for the 22-year-old. And according to French football expert Manu Lonjon (via Football Italia), Napoli have shortlisted Dennis as a top priority this summer. Countryman Osimhen is also believed to be on the Italians’ radar, although his £45million transfer tag is off-putting for the Serie A club. Dennis’ considerably cheaper transfer fee presents a viable alternative for Napoli, who are looking to bolster their attacking ranks next season should the likes of Lorenzo Insigne, Dries Mertens or Hirving Lozano leave this summer.
