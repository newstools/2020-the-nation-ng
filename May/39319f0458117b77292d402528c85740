 The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) has dismissed an allegation that it discharged toxic or chemical substances into the Atlantic Ocean. An environmentalist, Mr. Furoebi Akene, earlier claimed that chemical from Shell operations at Forcados oil export terminal was the cause of death of thousands of croaker fish washed ashore the coastlines. But Shell in a statement by its Manager, Media Relations, Olugbenga Odugbesan, insisted that there was no release of dangerous, toxic or chemical substances from its operations at the Forcados Oil Terminal, or from its facilities in Ogulagha or any part of the Niger Delta where the company operates. He said: “Relevant government agencies are already investigating the alleged fish kill incident along the coastline in the Niger Delta and SPDC is supporting the investigations. “The Nigeria Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA) was widely reported to have clearly stated that there is no evidence that oil and gas operations may have impacted the aquatic environment as being claimed in respect of the fish kill incident. “On our part, we are working with the relevant government agencies and the Delta State Ministry of Environment in the investigation of the allegation. “We have conducted a joint investigation visit to the coastline, samples have been collected and testing is ongoing in accredited laboratories”.
