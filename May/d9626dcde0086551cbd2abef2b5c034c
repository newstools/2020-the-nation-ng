League champions Club Bruges will meet Royal Antwerp in the Belgian Cup final on Aug. 1, the Belgian football association said on Thursday. The match, which is holding in spite of the rest of the 2019/2020 season having been called off, will take place behind closed doors at the King Baudouin Stadium in Brussels. The decision was announced after the two clubs, the Belgian Pro League and football association met with city officials to sort out arrangements and police and security services gave a green light. The final was originally supposed to be played on March 22 but was called off at the start of the COVID-19 health crisis. Belgium has since ended its season early with Club Bruges declared champions.
