 LAGOS State government has shot down two facilities in Badagry West Local Council Development Area (LCDA) for contravening its new guidelines on COVID-19 to operators of hotels, clubs and other entertainment outfits. The sealed facilities are: Maggi Hotel and Tambari Theatre Art (Night Club), both in Seme axis of Badagry. The governor said their owners will be prosecuted. The Special Adviser to the Governor on Tourism, Arts and Culture, Mr. Solomon Bonu, spoke in Lagos on the government’s action. He said: “Apart from the fact that these facilities open for normal operations in defiance to the government’s directive, it was also discovered that there is a high level of immorality going on in these places. The night club has become home for strippers, drug barons and all sorts of mischief.” The governor’s aide expressed displeasure about “the unruly and unlawful practices” by the management of the two facilities. He said the state’s guidelines issued by the Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture were violated, despite several advocacies by the government.
