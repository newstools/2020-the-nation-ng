Lagos State Commissioner for Transportation Dr Frederic Abimbola Oladeinde has sought private sector partnership towards curtailing the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. He said the government cannot do it alone. He spoke when the Cherubim and Seraphim Church (C&S), Surulere District, Lagos donated some medical items worth N1.5million to the state COVID-19 fund. They include personal protective equipment (PPE), such as gowns, hand gloves, and face masks. Presenting the items in Lekki, the church’s Senior District Secretary, Special Apostle (Pastor) John Adegoke, said the work of tackling the pandemic was enormous and should not be left for the government alone. He also noted the work being done by health workers who are in the frontline in prosecuting the pandemic. The cleric praised the government for its efforts in eradicating the disease, adding that Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s daily briefings and dialogue with the people were worth mentioning. Oladeinde thanked the church for the gesture, adding that nothing was too small. He said the items would go a long way to solve the problem. With them at the event were the church’s Secretary, Special Apostle (Prophet) John O. Coker and Special Apostle (Pastor) Kolawole Showemino.
