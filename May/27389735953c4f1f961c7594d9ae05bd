 A murder suspect, Adamu Adamu, who is being treated for COVID-19 at the Ondo Infectious Disease Hospital almost escaped from the hospital but for eagle-eyed security personnel. Security has been beefed up at the hospital since the escape was foiled. Adamu, who was arrested in Edo State, was among the four suspects arrested in connection to the murder of Pa Fasorantiâ€™s daughter, Mrs. Olufunke Olakunri. A visit to the hospital showed soldiers have been mobilised to support policemen on guard at the hospital. Doctors at the hospital confirmed that the suspect has made several attempts by deploying various tactics to escape from custody. Police sources said it was the timely intervention of its men that prevented the latest attempt to flee custody. Adamu was said to spend long hours in the toilet each time he took permission to use the facility. It was gathered that the little free movement granted the suspect inside the ward where COVID-19 patients are receiving treatment was stopped. Sources said he is being chained to his bed and closely monitored to the toilet. Ondo Police spokesman, ASP Tee-Leo Ikoro, said he would visit the hospital to ascertain situation of things. He said security has been beefed up at the hospital
