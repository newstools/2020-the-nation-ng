Lagos State House of Assembly has tasked power Distributing Companies (DISCOs) in the state to ensure residents enjoy considerable power supply. A joint committee of the House made up of Committee on Energy and Mineral Resources, and Information, Security and Strategy on an oversight visit to Eko and Ikeja Electricity Distribution Company, asked them to provide regular power to the people. The committee chair Folajimi Mohammed said the lockdown has caused a lot of discomfort to constituents, “to this end we were asked to come and visit the DISCOs and find out issues as to why there has been insufficient supply of electricity to most parts of Lagos State. “One thing was pertinent about the meeting, which was that they accepted and admitted the flaws. However, we have asked that they give us a roadmap to how they want to ensure more effective distribution to the people. “I am glad that Ikeja DISCO has honoured that request, saying that they would appoint people who would directly relate with us at the House of Assembly for onward transfer to our constituents.”
