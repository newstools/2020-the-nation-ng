The Ibeju-Lekki People’s Forum on Thursday said Monday’s protest that resulted in mayhem and injuries in the area was carried out by non-resident miscreants. It said over “100 innocent youths” and not the police figure of 51, were arrested and detained “in retaliation”. The Forum alleged that the police “went as far as entering the private apartments of some indigenes of Eleko, Museyo, Idado, Orimedu, Magbon Alade, Akodo and Idasho, siezed people and confiscated their phones at gun point. “We strongly call on the Lagos State government to prevail on the Commissioner of Police, Lagos to release the youths so that they can be reconciled with their families,” the group said in a letter to the Lagos Police Command. It also urged the Area ‘C’ Command, Panti to permit the detainees access to their lawyers. The police on Monday said it arrested the youths for allegedly protesting against the lockdown directive. Its Public Relations Officer (PRO) Bala Elkana said the youths injured five policemen and destroyed two police outstations in the process. “The youth went violent because they said they were tired of staying at home and they needed money, because they live on daily income; so, they took to the street and started attacking anybody they saw and they injured five policemen and destroyed two of our outstations in the area.”
