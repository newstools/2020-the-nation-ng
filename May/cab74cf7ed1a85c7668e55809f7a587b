 BAYELSA State Governor Douye Diri has said an unnamed medical doctor had tested positive for COVID-19 in the state. This brings the number of active cases in the state to two. Diri announced the new confirmed case yesterday during a meeting of the COVID-19 Task Force, which he chairs, at the Government House in Yenagoa. A statement by his Acting Chief Press Secretary, Mr Daniel Alabrah, quoted the governor as saying the doctor, who works at the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) in Yenagoa, was earlier admitted at a private hospital before he tested positive for the virus. Diri said the doctorâ€™s travel history showed that he entered the state after a trip to neighbouring Delta State, adding that the hospital had been shut down for decontamination. The governor, who said five other positive COVID-19 patients had been successfully treated and discharged, cautioned frontline medical personnel handling active cases to adhere strictly to the laid down protocols.
