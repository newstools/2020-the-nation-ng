Kaduna State Standing Committee on COVID-19 has said 50 persons have been quarantined at the national Youth Service Corps (NYSC) camp for allegedly violating the ban on interstate travel. In an update on Tuesday by Special Adviser to the Governor on Media and Communication, Mr Muyiwa Adekeye, the committee said the violators “will be isolated there for 14 days to ensure that they are COVID-19-free”. Adekeye said: “The quarantine centre received its first set of 27 guests on Sunday, while 23 others were brought in on Monday, following the deployment of senior Kaduna State government officials to enforce the restriction of movement at various points of entry into the state.” The Special Adviser warned “that Kaduna State will no longer offer the option of quarantine for persons traveling illegally”.
