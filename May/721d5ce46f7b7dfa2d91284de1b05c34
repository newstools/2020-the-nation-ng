 THE Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) has commenced the distribution of medical supplies, relief materials and public enlightenment campaigns against the Coronavirus pandemic to all the states in the Niger Delta region. Speaking at the NDDC Warehouse, in Trans-Amadi Industrial Layout, Port Harcourt, the Commission’s Acting Managing Director, Prof. Kemebradikumo Pondei, lamented the poor state of health facilities in the country. He said such poor state of affairs specifically in most states of the Niger Delta region was a major constraint in the fight against COVID-19. He said: “No doubt, the disease has also taken its toll on the socio-economic well-being of citizens, especially as most small and medium scale businesses have been affected with the lockdown imposed in the states.”
