 A MAN, Timothy Osai, 34, accused of sleeping with a  kinsman’s wife has been beaten to death in Ihie, a community in Ohaji-Egbema Local Government Area of Imo State, it was gathered. His attackers were said to be hired thugs. Osai was said to have died from  injuries he sustained from the beating. The incident took place last weekend. It was gathered that Osai had been having a secret affair with a  married woman, whose brother warned him to stop. He did not, and cult boys were called on him. His death prompted angry youths to set six houses ablaze in protest against the cult boys’ action. Police spokesman Orlando Ikeokwu could not confirm the incident before press time.
