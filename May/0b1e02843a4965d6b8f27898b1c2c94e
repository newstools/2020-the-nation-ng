Federal University of Technology, Owerri (FUTO) has manufactured sanitisers as part of its  efforts to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic. According to the management, the sanitiser which has since been delivered to the Imo State government for onward distribution to the public, is 75 per cent alcoholic, 15 per cent above the 60 per cent recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Head of the Department of Chemistry, Prof Cynthia E. Ogukwe who handed over the bags of the sanitisers to the Vice Chancellor of the institution Prof Francis C. Eze, explained that the department developed an in-house test to determine the quantity of ethanol and usage of raw materials in the production. He said: “The global out-break of COVID-19 demands contributions from scientists and researchers all over the world. FUTO therefore, in the spirit of driving the culture of excellence is not left out. The hand sanitisers are FUTO’s contributions to Imo State government in the fight against the spread of coronavirus in the state”. Receiving the substances, Prof Eze praised the Department of Chemistry for the sanitiser which he said, would strengthen the job of the committee already set up by the university to sensitise the host communities on methods to prevent the pandemic. Eze urged the department to produce the substance in commercial qualities in future for public consumption.
