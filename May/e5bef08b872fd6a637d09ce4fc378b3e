United States President, Donald Trump has revealed that Nigeria will do anything to have ventilators needed in the world’s fight against the novel coronavirus disease. Speaking at a press briefing aired on Fox News, Trump confirmed that there were plans by the US to send ventilators from Florida to other countries amid the coronavirus pandemic. Governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis was at the briefing. According to Trump, Florida had been in need of ventilators and thousands were sent to them and now, they had a surplus not being used which could be sent to other countries. “Ron said one thing that was interesting. He talked about ventilators and that ventilators were going to be a disaster in Florida and not enough and we sent them thousands of ventilators. But in the meantime, you have thousands of ventilators that aren’t used and we’ll be able to send them probably to other countries,” he said. “You’ll build up your stockpile because these other countries, Italy, France, Spain; we’re sending to Spain. I spoke today to Nigeria. They’ll do anything for ventilators. We’re going to send at least 200 ventilators to Nigeria; probably more than that.”
