 Telecoms firm, 9mobile, has provided unhindered access to educational and health content on some websites for its customers. The educational websites on this service include Schoolgate, Mobile Classroom, National Open University, Khan Academy and Seesaw (in partnership with Federal Ministry of Education). The health-related sites are Mobihealth, World Health Organisation (WHO), Nigeria Health Watch, HealthLine, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), amongst others.  The Executive Director, Regulatory and Corporate Affairs, Abdulrahman Ado, said access to these websites ensure 9mobile customers remain connected to essential services, adding that health and education were two out of the three pillars of the company’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programmes. “The decision to focus on these two areas at this time is borne out of a desire to provide access to health and educational information and services, a critical requirement during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As a responsible organisation, we felt the need to support the increasing recourse to online learning by a growing number of academic institutions during this period of lockdown,” she said.
