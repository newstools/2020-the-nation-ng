 POLICE in Lagos on Wednesday arrested a dismissed soldier identified as Okoliko Andrew and one Idowu Adebayo for allegedly smuggling 1,200kgs of Marijuana. The suspects were intercepted around Itowolo in Ikorodu for plying the Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) corridor by men of the Lagos State Task Force. They were said to have driven two vehicles loaded with illicit drugs on the prohibited BRT lanes and when intercepted, presented themselves as serving military personnel. Not convinced by their defence, policemen attached to the task force were said to have searched the vehicles where the hard substances were allegedly found. According to a witness, the policemen became suspicious when the suspects could not properly identify themselves. It was gathered that 25 bags of 50kg Marijuana were recovered from them.
