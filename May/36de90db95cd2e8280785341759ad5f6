 CHLOROQUINE, an anti-malaria drug, has aided the recovery of six Coronavirus patients in Bauchi State, including Governor Bala Mohammed, Health  Commissioner Dr. Aliyu Maigoro has said. Maigoro, who backed the governor’s stand on chloroquine treatment, addressed reporters yesterday in a telephone interview. He said five other patients who were discharged about two weeks ago after the governor’s recovery were also given a dose of the anti-malaria drug.  The Nation reports that six patients had recovered and discharged since the outbreak of the pandemic. Maigoro said: “As the governor rightly stated at the briefing, the same chloroquine treatment was also applied as treatment for the other five patients who were discharged after the governor’s recovery…”
