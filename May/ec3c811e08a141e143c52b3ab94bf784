 Niger state Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello has announced the banning of commercial motorcycle operations across the state saying that the motorcyclists are constantly flaunting the government orders without any restraints. The state government has also extended the lockdown in the state by two weeks calling on the people to obey the lockdown order to enable the state re-open. Speaking with newsmen after a review meeting with the state COVID-19 Taskforce, Bello expressed dismay over the way and manner the people in the state have been breaching the COVID-19 order of social distancing and non-compliance in wearing of facemasks. “It is regrettable that closure of interstate borders has not been very effective while commercial motorcyclists and other commercial drivers are seen flouting government orders without much ado”. ” In view of the prevailing circumstances, there will be a total ban on the operation of Commercial Motorcycle (Okada)for the next two weeks while the status quo remains on all other measures put in place in the last two weeks.” The Governor stated that plans are ongoing by the Niger State Government to establish a molecular laboratory and a testing center at the General Hospital, Minna, to increase testing capacity and reduce the time for the release of Covid-19 results in the state. He said that 457 health workers had been trained while 20 ad-hoc staff had been recruited to man the laboratory. The Governor urged the general public to be more vigilant, adhere strictly to personal hygiene, observe social distancing at public places, wear facemasks and seek medical attention in the event of symptoms such as fever, cough, and catarrh. “Let me also call on individuals with travel history from states with cases of Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) to ensure they self-isolate and promptly report to the nearest health facility.”
