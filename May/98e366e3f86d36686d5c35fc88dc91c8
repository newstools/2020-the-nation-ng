The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has paid workers May salary for the Salah celebrations amid the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. In a statement, Special Adviser to the Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, Mr. Crusoe Osagie, said the state government paid workers May salary on May 21, ahead of the regular 25th day of every month benchmark, to provide civil and public servants support to celebrate the festivities. According to him, “Governor Godwin Obaseki has approved the payment of salaries for May, and workers in the state received their salaries on the 21st of May. This is despite the economic setbacks that has bedeviled the Nigerian economy and other parts of the world amid the coronavirus pandemic. “It is also a way for government to identify with the Muslim faithful for the Salah celebrations. So, the gesture is timed to ensure that our Muslim brothers and sisters are well-catered for during the Salah festivities amid COVID-19 pandemic.” Osagie noted that the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led administration has continued to prioritise the welfare of workers, a situation that has resulted in harmonious relations between the state government and the various workers’ unions in the state.
