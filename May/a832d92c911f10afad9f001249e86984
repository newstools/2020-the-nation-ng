Kaduna State has praised the military for its successful operations against banditry in Chikun, Igabi, Giwa and Birnin Gwari local governments. Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs Samuel Aruwan, on Sunday, noted that the Air Force operations on Thursday and Friday were successful. He said the operation ‘’neutralised bandits in Chikun while working on other targets’’. “During operations against bandits in a nearby location last Thursday, munitions aimed at the criminals partly damaged an Assemblies of God Church building in Kabarasha Village in Chikun … However, no civilian casualty was recorded…” he said. The statement said Governor Nasir El-Rufai had ”directed the commissioner to assess the situation and present a report so that the damage to the church could be repaired.” ”The commissioner and his team are engaging critical stakeholders on the matter and will soon report … to the governor,” it added. Aruwan noted that the success of the joint military operation would boost the confidence of farmers to till their land and avert food insecurity. The statement said combined military teams of Operation Thunder Strike, Operation Whirl Punch and Air Force’s Operation Gama Aiki,  are presently fighting bandits in the state.
