No fewer than eight doctors have tested positive to coronavirus in Zamfara, the state’s branch of the Nigeria Medical Association (NMA) has said. The NMA Vice-Chairman in the state, Dr Mannir Bature, disclosed this in Gusau on Wednesday, in a chat with reporters. He said: “Out of about 80 confirmed cases recorded so far in the state, 10 per cent are doctors who came into contact with the virus in the line of duty while trying to save lives especially at emergencies. “We are however happy to note that out of the number, sixty per cent have been discharged from hospital while the remaining are responding to treatment,” he said. Dr Bature also said 30 other doctors who came into contact with their infected colleagues went into self-isolation in order to curb further spread of the virus in the state. “This situation has seriously caused negative impact on the performance of doctors in the state, especially in this period of the pandemic because we only have a total of about 300 doctors in the state, including those at the Federal Medical Center, Gusau, those at state government health facilities and those in private practice.
