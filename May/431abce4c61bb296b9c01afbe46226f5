Some 101 vehicles have been impounded and their drivers prosecuted for flouting the border closure order in Zamfara State. The transporters were intercepted by a committee headed by the state Commissioner of Police Usman Nagoggo. They were found guilty by mobile courts sitting at the borders and heavily fined, Nagoggo said.
