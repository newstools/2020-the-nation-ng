Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has announced the merger of the Technical School at Benue State University Makurdi with Special Science Senior Secondary School Makurdi. The new school will be called Government Science and Technical College Makurdi. Ortom, who made the announcement after inspecting infrastructure at the Special Science Senior Secondary School Makurdi, said the merger would enable the State Government to give maximum attention to the institution as global focus is now on science and technical education. The Governor, who also inspected infrastructure at the Alfred Akawe Torkula College of Advanced and Professional Studies, Makurdi, said that the legislative process to convert the College to a Polytechnic had reached advanced stage at the Benue State House of Assembly. He directed the Education Commissioner, Prof. Dennis Ityavyar to immediately compile the list of challenges confronting the two schools in order of priority and forward same to him for attention. Principal Special Science Senior Secondary School Makurdi, Mrs. Lilian Ameh, who was delighted by the Governor’s visit, identified uncompleted projects in the school to include girls’ hostel, multipurpose hall, clinic and technology centre which she said needed urgent attention.
