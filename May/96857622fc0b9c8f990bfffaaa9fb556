National Automotive Design and Development Council (NADDC) has inspected the Simba Safety Shield,  produced by the Simba Group. The shield is a combination of a transparent screen separating the commercial tricycle (keke) rider and the passenger cabins, and a transparent barrier in between the rear passengers. It was developed in response to the need  for social distancing amid the COVID-19 pandemic. NADDC Director-General, Mr Jelani Aliyu, said: “This is truly an excellent innovation for use in tricycles, which are used across the country for essential point-to-point transportation. “We really appreciate that this safety device has been 100 per cent designed and developed in Nigeria, keeping in mind the safety of commuters and the riders of tricycles. Kudos to Simba TVS for doing this.” The Simba Safety Shield, which was launched earlier this month, has been widely praised for protecting against the spread of coronavirus. Kekes already have an advantage in that they carry fewer passengers, and have good cross ventilation, but this shield increases the safety even further. A statement from the Simba Group, who distributes the leading Keke brand in Nigeria, the TVS King, said: “At Simba TVS, we have always invested in research and development, to develop locally-relevant and innovative solutions to the unique challenges faced by Nigerian commuters. “These are certainly unique times, and we are particularly proud that our engineering team has designed, developed and deployed the Simba Safety Shield in rapid response to the current Covid-19 crisis. “Ever since we launched the Shield a few weeks ago, there has been tremendous interest from Keke riders, and passengers alike. “With more and more passengers choosing Kekes in these times of social distancing, it was important that we give them further confidence during their commute”.
