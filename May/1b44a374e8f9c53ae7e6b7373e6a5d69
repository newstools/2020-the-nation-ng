A kidnap suspect has been shot dead and another arrested as police in Enugu rescue three kidnap victims. A statement signed by the State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), ASP Daniel Ndukwe, said the feat was recorded in two separate operations on May 16th and 26th respectively. He disclosed that the operatives engaged the suspected kidnappers in a gun duel at their hideout, leading to the death of one and the arrest of the other, who sustained severe bullet injuries. Preliminary investigation, he said, reveals that two of the victims, a father and daughter, were reported kidnapped on May 15, 2020 at about 5pm, by armed men at a building site in Eziama Abakpa-Nike. However, a combined team of operatives attached to the Command’s anti-kidnapping and anti-cult Units, acting on intelligence, rescued the victims unhurt inside a forest in the said community. The third victim, he noted, was reported kidnapped on May 25, 2020 at about 8:30pm in exchange for her son and one other, who were being held by the alleged Kidnappers. “However, following a tactical and intelligence operation carried out by operatives of the Command’s anti kidnapping Unit at the said forest, the victim was successfully rescued unhurt, after an intense gun battle with the Kidnappers, which led to the death of one.” The second suspect was reportedly arrested with severe bullet injuries and in a critical condition. The PPRO said one AK-47 rifle with breech no. HM9221, twenty rounds of live ammunition, two machetes, four handsets and a cash sum of N700.00 were recovered from them. Commending the operatives for their efforts, the state Commissioner of Police, CP Ahmad AbdurRahman, urged residents to always assist the Police with credible information required to effectively police the State.
