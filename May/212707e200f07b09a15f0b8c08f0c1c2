 The remains of late highlife music legend, Dr. Victor Abimbola Olaiya, was laid to rest on Thursday, May 7. The remains of the late Olaiya were interred at the Vaults & Garden Cemetery, Ikoyi, Lagos. The burial was a private ceremony that was attended by selected family members and very few friends of the late music legend. The late Olaiya was laid in state briefly in a hall for guests to pay their last respect before his internment in a brown shiny casket. Late Olaiya’s burial was streamed live on Facebook and had guests wearing face masks as well as observing social distancing in line with Lagos State Government rules on curbing the spread of COVID-19. The burial was also devoid of fanfare that has become synonymous with the burial of music greats that had passed on in Nigeria and across the world. For the late Olaiya’s burial, it was amid solemn music with the family members in attendance paying their last respect during the lying in state proceedings. The ceremony was also devoid of the usual Aso-Ebi that is synonymous with burials in Yoruba tradition. Though the pallbearers spotted a uniformed outfit of black colour with a red rope on their neck, they had an inscription of Victor Olaiya on their clothing. Olaiya died at 89 on February 12th, 2020 at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), Lagos.
