Former Minister of State for Defence Senator Musiliu Obanikoro yesterday paid tribute to the late Justice Isola Oluwa, describing him as a patriot. Obanikoro said in a statement in Lagos that the deceased was an epitome of courage and integrity. He said: “As a lawyer of note, Justice Oluwa was courageous and never shied away from the truth. He supported every just cause and ensured that justice prevailed in everything that he was involved with. “His life as a Lagosian was even the more worthy of note. He was one native of Lagos, who was unpretentious about the progress and development of the state. He loved Lagos and did everything within his capacity to advance the cause of the state.” Obanikoro added: “Lagos has lost a titan with the death of Justice Isola Oluwa. He was courageous and fearless in all his endeavours. He never allowed the allure of money to affect  his view of life and the discharge of his duties to humanity. “He never waived in his fight for the course of indigenous people of lagos. He has left a big vacuum which is almost impossible to fill. My heart goes out to his immediate and extended family. “I, therefore, join all native Lagosians, Nigerians and the learned world in general to mourn one of the most amasing creatures, who passed on, though at a time the world is going through a major challenge, however in the Holy month of Ramadan. May Allah forgive his sins and grant him Aljanah Firdaus.
