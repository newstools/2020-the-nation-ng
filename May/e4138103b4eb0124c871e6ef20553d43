A warehouse where a large quantity of adulterated fertiliser is stored has been discovered in Minna, the Niger State capital. Police who found the warehouse, also made some arrests. Policemen intercepted one Nma Mohammed driving a Hiace bus loaded with 50 bags of the fertiliser. The suspect reportedly admitted that the fertiliser was adulterated, though he and his partners wanted to sell it to unsuspecting farmers. Further investigation led to the arrest ofÂ another suspect and the recovery of 456 bags of the adulterated fertiliser. Police spokesman Abiodun Wasiu confirmed the arrests, saying that the suspects had confessed to the crime. He added that the case was under investigation and that the suspects would be charged to court soon.
