 Leading opposition party in Cross River State All Progressive Congress(APC) has picked holes in the rescheduled local government elections fixed for Saturday May 30. A statement from the State chairman, Sir John Ochalla, declared “the APC Cross River State will not be part of the charade on Saturday.” It noted: “The processes leading to the conduct of the election have been fraught with gross irregularities and deliberate subversions of basic constitutional requirements guiding conduct of an election. “Giving a two to three days’ notice for the conduct of an election of this magnitude is not only ridiculous but very irresponsible.” The party further noted it is in Court with CROSIEC (Cross River State Independent Electoral Commission) and Cross River State Government seeking to compel the state electoral body to adhere strictly to the dictates of the Constitutions /Acts of the National Assembly and the CROSIEC bye-laws.” It called on all APC “candidates to the election, party faithful and teeming supporters of our great Party should remain calm and law-abiding, while they go about their lawful duties without let or hindrance.” The notice of election by the state electoral body signed by its chairman, Mike Ushie, noted that the election which was earlier scheduled to take place on March 28 has been rescheduled for May 30th.
It noted: “Accreditation and voting start at 8.am on that day and closes 3.pm to give room for collation. All movements are restricted except those on essential and election duties. Markets and shops shall remain closed within the period. Voting takes place at polling stations and no loitering shall be entertained at such zones”.
