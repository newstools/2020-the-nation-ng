The Council of Ulama in Ilorin Emirate has directed Muslims in the state to observe Eid-el-Fitr prayers in their homes. In a statement, vice chairman of the highest decision making council of religious leaders in the state, Alhaji Abdullahi Abdulhameed gave the directive. Abdulhameed, who is also the Imam Imale of Ilorin, said that the directive became necessary because of the need to observe COVID-19 safety measures by the Muslim faithful during the Eid-el- Fitr prayers. The council urged Muslims across the 16 local government areas of the state to make the sacrifice to forestall possible spread of COVID-19 disease. “The directive of the state government concerning keeping social distance among others at this time of COVID-19 aimed at protecting lives and public safety must be complied with by the worshippers,” it said.
