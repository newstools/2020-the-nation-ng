 THE Director-General of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Dr Tedros Ghebreysus, has said that the coronavirus outbreak is teaching the world humility. Ghebreyesus’ view echoed a recent statement by the founder of the Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN), Prophet T.B. Joshua. The WHO DG spoke on May 18 while addressing world leaders during the first virtual session of the World Health Assembly amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. “If this virus is teaching us anything, it’s humility. Time for humility. For all the economic, military and technological might of nations, we have been humbled by this very small microbe,” he said. The former Ethiopian Minister of Health seemed to corroborate Joshua’s statement at the beginning of 2020, in the early days of the novel Coronavirus infection. Speaking on his Emmanuel TV on January 5, 2020, Joshua said: “This year will be a year of humility. This year, the Lord will humble us with our challenges. Challenges can be affliction… To humble us with these is for those things to destroy us or expose us. Let us move closer to God.” In the same programme, the cleric warned of serious economic backlash worldwide and a sickness surfacing which leaders initially tried to cover up.
