The All Progressives Congress(APC) may adopt indirect mode of primaries for election of its governorship candidate in Ondo State. A member of the National Executive Committee disclosed this to our reporter in Akure. But a governorship aspirant and former Commissioner for Justice and Attorney General of the state, Hon Isaacs Kekemeke, told newsmen last week that majority of stakeholders in the party want the direct mode of primaries. The APC NEC member said the decision to use the indirect primaries for Ondo State was reached at last week’s meeting of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party. It was learnt the NWC choose the indirect mode for Ondo because there are no factions of the APC unlike Edo where there are two factions of the APC. But Kekemeke said the reason direct mode of primaries was preferred in Ondo was because of the controversies surrounding the emergence of party officials at the last congresses in the state. He said there has not been cohesive party leadership in the state that is inclusive. According to him: “I know that direct primaries is the preferable option. It is the inevitable for victory and success of the party.”
