The wife of Derek Chauvin, the dismissed police officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck during his arrest, has filed for divorce, her lawyer said. Kellie Chauvin said on Friday night she would split from her husband, who’s been charged with murdering the 46-year-old black dad in Minneapolis. Chauvin’s legal team at Sekula Law Offices said the former Mrs. Minnesota is “devastated” by Floyd’s death and that her “utmost sympathy” is with his family. “This evening, I spoke with Kellie Chauvin and her family. She is devastated by Mr. Floyd’s death and her utmost sympathy lies with his family, with his loved ones and with everyone who is grieving this tragedy,” reads the statement from Sekula Law Offices. “While Ms. Chauvin has no children from her current marriage, she respectfully requests that her children, her elder parents, and her extended family be given safety and privacy during this difficult time.” Kellie’s divorce announcement came hours after police arrested Derek Chauvin in Minneapolis and charged him with third-degree murder in Floyd’s death. The 44-year-old was taken into custody four days after disturbing arrest footage showed him kneeling on the black man’s neck as he pleaded for his life. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Chauvin could face more charges. The criminal complaint filed against Chauvin cited that preliminary findings from a Tuesday autopsy conducted by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner saw ‘no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxiation or strangulation’. ‘Mr. Floyd had underlying health conditions including coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease,’ said the complaint from the Hennepin County Attorney. ‘The combined effects of Mr. Floyd being restrained by police, his underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system likely contributed to his death.’ The full medical examiner’s report is pending.
