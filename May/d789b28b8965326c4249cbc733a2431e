Chief Bisi Akande, former Interim National Chairman, All Progressives Congress (APC), has lauded President Muhammadu Buhari’s appointment of Kashim Ibrahim-Imam as Chairman, Board of Trustees, Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND). Akande, a former Governor of Osun, made this known in a statement issued in Lagos on Saturday. He described Ibrahim-Imam, who was a former Presidential Liaison Officer, as the party’s cornerstone hitherto overlooked in appointments. He said Ibrahim-Imam played a crucial role in the merger of legacy parties, culminating in the birth of APC. “When Buhari’s government, perhaps inadvertently, gave Ibrahim-Imam no position, Tinubu requested me to talk to Buhari on Ibrahim-Imam’s behalf. “I refused because I presumed that there must have been a dangerous disconnect between the APC and its government. “Now that the president has approved a position for Ibrahim-Imam in government, I congratulate President Buhari and I also congratulate Ibrahim-Imam. “I also sincerely congratulate the APC. I hope that from now on, the party and the government can learn to work in sync. “Ibrahim-Imam’s appointment shows that the rejected stone has been reserved for the corner of the house,” he said. Akande said Ibrahim-Imam is the son of Alhaji Ibrahim-Imam, who used to be the Leader of Opposition of the Action Group (AG) in the old Northern House of Assembly. The former interim chairman said Ibrahim-Imam was in the Social Democratic Party (SDP) during the Babangida era, and later became a Special Adviser to President Obasanjo on Senate Matters. (NAN)
