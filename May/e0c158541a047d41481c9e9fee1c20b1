 The Presidential Task Force (PTF) on the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic has clarified that the Madagascar COVID-19 solution will go through standard validation process before it can be considered for use in Nigeria. Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) and Chairman of the PTF, Mr Boss Mustapha, who disclosed this during Monday’s daily media briefing by the task force in Abuja, said Nigeria had not taken delivery of the Madagascar COVID-19 solution yet. The SGF spoke on the Madagascar syrup while answering questions from journalists during the briefing, adding that the solution, which was sent to several other African countries, was delivered to Guinea Bissau, from where Nigeria would have to freight back home. He, however, said President Muhammadu Buhari had instructed him to ensure that Nigeria’s consignment of the syrup was ferried home and must be passed through the normal validation protocols that all other such potential cures or vaccines had to go through. “It’s been sent to Guinea Bissau by the President or Prime Minister of Madagascar and certain allocations have been made to different countries. We have an indication of the quantity that has been allocated to Nigeria and we are supposed to make an arrangement to freight it out of Guinea Bissau to Nigeria. “I’ve received instructions from Mr President to make arrangements to freight it home, with a clear instruction that I should subject it to the validation process similar to what will happen to any other medicine or syrup or vaccine that is discovered or created internally. So it will be subjected to the same process before it is put into any form of use. There’ll be no exception for that”, he said.
