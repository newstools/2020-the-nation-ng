FoodCo Foundation, the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) affiliate of FoodCo Nigeria Limited, has distributed care packages, comprising food items and essential supplies, to orphanages, widows as well as low-income households in Lagos and Ibadan. Justifying the need for the donations, Ade Sun-Basorun, CEO of FoodCo Nigeria Limited and a Trustee of the Foundation, said the rippled negative effects of the ravaging coronavirus across various segments of society, low income households have been particularly hit as many have had their source of livelihoods disrupted. “We appreciate the efforts of the Oyo State COVID-19 Emergency Response Team who, like their counterparts across the country and globally, continue to do outstanding work at the frontlines, which informed our decision to supply them with daily refreshments. We thank you for the hard work and sacrifice you put in to ensure that this disease is contained so that we all can return to normalcy as soon as possible,” he added.
