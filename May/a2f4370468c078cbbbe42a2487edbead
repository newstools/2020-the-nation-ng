Niger State Police Command has arrested four suspects for kidnapping and armed robbery in various parts of the state. One of them, Basiru Musa Nayeya, reportedly wrote a letter threatening to kidnap one Alhaji Bako Sani asking him to pay N5 million or risk being kidnapped. After negotiations, he and his gang agreed to accept N50,000 but Sani reported the incident to the police who arrested Nayeya when he attempted to pick the money at a specific point. During interrogation, the suspect revealed that he was an ex-convict. Police spokesman Wasiu Abiodun said that all the suspects have confessed to the crimes, adding that investigations were ongoing and that the suspects would soon be charged to court.
