Chairman, Board of Trustees (BoT), Actors Guild of Nigeria (AGN), Prince Ifeanyi Dike has called on the federal and state governments to make lands available for the creative industry to farm. In a recent chat with Dike, the veteran actor and TV presenter said, this is because of the current coronavirus pandemic that has increased the hunger in the land due to the lockdown to contain its spread. He said, “You can see that we are almost refugees in our land looking for palliatives. If you give medicines to positive COVID persons, without food the medicine would not work. If lands are given to actors to farm on when they are not on set or in a studio, it will not only reduce hunger in the land but it will be an additional income for them.” Continuing, Dike said, “As a consultant for Pally Agro Farms which supplied 1,000 eggs to COVID-19 patients and caregivers through the Lagos State primary healthcare board, I know how far the gesture went in feeding them. So, the government should please go through the various state chapters of the associations to do the needful even as oil would soon become unpopular. Hunger is a serious pandemic on its own.”
