 The Zenith Labour Party (ZLP), has denied being part of the 14 political parties that fused together to support a governorship candidate under the Action Democratic Party. Mr. Biyi Poroye, Coordinator of the Emerging Political Committee’ (EPC) had told newsmen last week that ADP would be the third force in the state that would wrestle power from the ruling All Progressives Congress. But the ZLP said it could never be part of the ADP formation. Ondo Publicity Secretary of ZLP, Pastor Felix Olatunde, said the claim that the party has fused into the ADP was not only fallacious but also defamatory and inflammatory to the already charged political atmosphere in the state. Pastor Olatunde said the ZLP has leaders with the most attractive political credentials not only in Ondo state but aross the country. Olatunde noted that the ZLP leaders could not be passive participants in any political formation? According to him, “The ZLP is not only disclaiming the concocted ADP membership but also dissuading the public from being part of the decorated fallacy. “ZLP in Ondo state is intact and the party is fully prepared to go into 2020 guber polls with the preparedness and assurances of monumental victory. “We appeal to our members to go about their normal party activities as permitted by the lockdown exigencies and ignore Biyi Poroye’s wicked lies. “The ZLP Ondo state received with great consternation the news of an obnoxious press release by a self styled EPC chairman, Biyi Poroye that the ZLP Ondo state is collaborating with some faceless political parties to form a party called ADP. “We decided to ignore it initially, but seeing now that it’s capable of blowing a wind of deceit across the state, it is pertinent to smother the effect of the falsehood on our political scheme of things.”
