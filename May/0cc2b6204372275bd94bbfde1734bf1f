Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr has enthused that this weekend’s kick off of the German Bundesliga as well as other leagues in Europe after weeks of football shut down occasioned by the Coronavirus pandemic is a healthy development  for legion of overseas-based Nigerian professionals. The German Football League in conjunction with government announced that the Bundesliga season will resume play on May 16 with highlight of the MatchDay 26 being tomorrow’s clash between Borussia Dortmund and Schalke. Also on Saturday, Eintracht Frankfurt  will take on  Borussia Monchengladbach  as well as  Koln against  Mainz while  Union Berlin  tackle Bayern Munich on Sunday. Though matches will be played behind closed doors so as to curtail the spread of COVID-19, German coach Rohr said the return to football will boost the fitness of the Super Eagles, adding it is a good omen for the fans and players to enjoy the game yet again. “It’s an important step (for football) to return to competition and Bundesliga is well prepared with a great sanitary concept,” the former Bayern Munich defender told NationSport. “Some of our players in Germany can play again;  Jamilu Collins, Maduka Okoye, Kingsley while other ones are following in June,” he added. Super Eagles winger Samuel Chukwueze only last week told NationSport that he was eagerly awaiting the return to football with Villarreal in the Spanish LaLiga after undergoing the mandatory COVID-19 test. “I’m really looking forward to scoring more goals when the LaLiga resumes and try  as much as possible to assist my team in ensuring that we get a ticket to play in the UEFA Champions League,” stated the 21-year-old former FIFA World Cup winner. “We are on the right track before the LaLiga was suspended and we are going to continue where we stopped when we resume.”
