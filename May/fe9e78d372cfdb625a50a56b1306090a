The Cross River State government has pulled down buildings said to be owned by kidnappers in Calabar, the state capital. The demolition, ordered by Governor Ben Ayade, was carried out on Thursday by a joint team of security agencies and government officials led by the Senior Special Assistance on Security to the Governor, Mr. Ani Esin. A mini-estate owned by Kufre Ekpo Eyo, alias Romance, the number one on the list of wanted persons declared by the government, was the first to be destroyed. Kufre, still at large, is believed to be the leader of a cult group and a kidnap syndicate. The demolition team also pulled down a brothel believed to be builtÂ  by another man on the wanted list. A former Speaker of the Cross River House of Assembly, Hon. John Gaul Lebo, said the action of the state government is backed by statutory provisions under the Cross River State Anti kidnapping Law 2015.
