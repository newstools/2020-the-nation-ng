 AN Ekiti State High Court sitting in Ado Ekiti on Monday sentenced two men and two women to death by hanging after being found guilty of murder. The convicts are Rashidat Abdul, 37, Oluwatosin Akarakiri, 32, Abdulrasheed Mutairu, 22, and Iyoriochile Eromoina, 18, to death by hanging. The quartet conspired and killed a 70-year-old man, Samuel Oloyede, on April5, 2017 in Odo Owa Ekiti, Ijero Local Government Area of the state. Justice Oluwatoyin Abodunde held that the prosecution proved the case of murder against the convicts beyond reasonable doubt. Justice Abodunde said: “I am persuaded that in the instant case, prosecution has proved the ingredients of murder beyond reasonable doubt by convincing and compelling qualitative unbroken circumstantial evidence and I so hold”. “The sentence of the court upon the four accused persons, is that you be hanged by the neck until you be dead and may God have mercy on your souls.” They were first arraigned on February12, 2018 when the charge was read and interpreted to them but pleaded not guilty. The deceased was a pensioner who operated a brothel in his personal house as a means of livelihood where all the accused persons also lived. There was a misunderstanding between the deceased and accused persons on payments and sharing formula, it was gathered.
