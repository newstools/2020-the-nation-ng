 Senior Special Assistant (SSA) on sports to the Lagos state governor, Prince Adeboye Adeyinka has lamented the disparity in salary of indigenous and foreign coaches while throwing his weight behind local gaffers for Super Eagles job. According to him, “Nigerian coaches are capable and doing well in other countries but the problem remains that we have failed to encourage them. Coaches such as Samson Siasia, Emmanuel Amuneke and Sunday Oliseh have done excellently well but we need to believe and encourage them to deliver for the country.” Speaking in Lagos, the sport administrator noted that the disparity in the salary of local and foreign coaches is discouraging. “ When you talk about expatriate versus indigenous coaches, my opinion is different. How much do we pay our indigenous coaches and how much do we pay the expatriate coaches. You see the problem? “We pay the expatriate coaches in dollars and then we pay our own coaches in naira. Let us first and foremost realize that we have capable coaches that have done very well for this country and are even doing great in other countries because there is no difference.” The Smart City Football Club president also dismissed the alleged bribery accusation leveled against Nigerian coaches by players as baseless.
