Only one out of 66 dredging companies in operation on Lagos waters is up to date in payment of required dues and taxes to the coffers of the state government. Others have consistently defaulted in payment of dues and taxes while a number have not been paying anything at all as required by the law. These were some of the findings disclosed by chairman of the Lagos State House of Assembly ad-hoc committee, set up to investigate activities of dredging companies in the state, Hon. Victor Akande while giving preliminary report of its investigation at plenary on Monday. Akande said the dredgers were denying the state huge sums of revenue by defaulting in the payment of statutory dues and taxes to the state that would have boosted the internally generated revenue of the state.
