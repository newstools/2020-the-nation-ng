A Chief Magistrates’ Court in Kafanchan, Kaduna State, on Thursday ordered that a 29-year-old man, Christopher Dauda, be remanded in a correctional centre for allegedly burning his mother-in-law’s house. The police charged Dauda with criminal trespass, mischief by fire with intent to destroy a house and attempt to commit culpable homicide. Chief Magistrate Abdulaziz Ibrahim, ordered that the accused be remanded in the Kafanchan Correctional facility. Ibrahim adjourned the case until May 20, for further mention. Earlier, the Prosecution Counsel, Insp. Esther Bishen, told the court that the complaint, Asabe Andrew, who lives in Manchok, reported the matter at the Kaura Police Division on May 5. Bishen said that the complainant, who is the mother-in-law of the accused, alleged some people entered her house, locked the doors and set it ablaze while her son asleep in the building. She said that the complainant lost a leather carpet, bedsheets and other valuables worth N57, 000. The prosecution alleged that the accused was behind the crime because he threatened to deal with his mother-in-law for no just cause. When the charges were read to the accused, he pleaded not guilty. The prosecutor prayed for an adjournment to enable the Police to complete investigations into the matter. The offence, she said, contravened the provisions of sections 327, 322 and 189 of the Penal Code of Kaduna State, 2017. (NAN)
