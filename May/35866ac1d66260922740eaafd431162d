As COVID-19 is affecting all sectors of the economy negatively across the globe, government. has been tasked to support all sectors of the economy ranging from health, education to agriculture, business, among others. This was said by an APC chieftain and PRO, CDC, Egbe- Idimu LCDA, Dr. Olugbemiga Gbadamosi, while giving out palliatives which included: rice, beans, garri, spaghetti, noodles, among others to people in his LCDA. According to Dr. Gbadamosi, the outbreak of the pandemic presents an alarming health crisis that the world is grappling with. “In addition, to the human impact, there is also the significant economic business and commercial impact being felt, and already, businesses in Nigeria are already experiencing COVID-19 disruptions. There is no doubt that the socio- economic impact  will still be felt long after the virus, hence government needs to support all sectors financially and otherwise” said Dr. Gbadamosi. Dr. Gbadamosi pointed out that as a community leader, he is doing the needful by not only giving out palliatives and cash gifts, but that he also intends giving out grants to the less-privileged in his community.
