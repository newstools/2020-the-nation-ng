 No fewer than 10 persons at the Lagos State Government House Marina have tested positive for COVID-19. Commissioner for Health, Professor Akin Abayomi, disclosed on Thursday afternoon on his verified twitter handle. He said the development forced Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and his wife, Joke to undergo another test. The tests, he however revealed, returned negative. “I am glad to announce that #COVID19 Incident Commander Governor of Lagos State @jidesanwoolu and the First Lady of Lagos @jokesanwoolu have consistently tested negative to #COVID19 following three consecutive tests conducted on them recently,” the tweet read. “However, 10 persons associated with Lagos State House in Marina have tested positive to #COVID19. On behalf of @followlasg, I therefore implore you all to continue to embrace the #MaskUpLagos initiative and observe all precautionary measures.”
