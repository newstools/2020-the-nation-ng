Bauchi State Government has lifted ban on religious gatherings which was initially imposed in April to contain the spread of coronavirus in the state. The development would enable Muslims in the state celebrate the Eid-el-Fitri celebrations, attend Friday Juma’at prayers on Friday and also enable Christians attend churches. Governor Bala Mohammed made the announcement on Wednesday at a stakeholders’ meeting held with traditional rulers, religious leaders and security agencies held at the Banquet Hall, Command Guest House in Bauchi. Mohammed said: ”I wish to convey the following decision that the partial lockdown imposed on the state has being relaxed and the deliberation will afford the people of Bauchi to attend their place of worship, the Friday prayers and the churches but they are to continue practicing social distancing and other safety measures. ”The total lockdown in Katagum, Zaki and Giade Local Government Areas is also relaxed.”
