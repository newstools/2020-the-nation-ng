Founder and General Overseer of Gospel Saints Church a.k.a Hand of Fire at Igando in Lagos Pastor Jacob Shodeinde has urged Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to use prayer to battle COVID-19. The cleric urged the governor to consider reopening churches because the COVID-19 pandemic would only be defeated spiritually. He described churches as spiritual worship centres where angels visit to convey people’s problems to God. In a letter to the governor, Pastor Shodiende offered to send the church’s Passover Water to be administered on COVID-19 patients for healing. He said: “The 10 litre ‘Passover Water’ is to be applied on all COVID-19 patients for instant healing. Only prayers can solve the problem of COVID-19. I have sent a personal message to the governor that he should consider reopening churches so we can  pray. “God told me to tell those in authority that they should reopen the churches because the solution to COVID-19 is in the House of God where the angels are waiting for the people. Churches should not be shut. Those who heard heavenly calling would understand the mystery surrounding the church, particularly the fact that angels build special structures within the physical churches. Those who think we are clamouring for church reopening because of tithes and offering are wrong because I’m not money-conscious. In fact, I don’t preach prosperity, but holiness. “We are ready to take a 10-litre can of our ‘Passover Water’ to Governor Sanwo-Olu to apply on those already diagnosed with COVID-19 and receiving treatments in isolation centres. They should just give them the water to drink with spoons and watch their speedy recovery. “Many who were diagnosed of terrible ailments, including HIV/AIDS, have received instant healing here and no member of my church would be infected with COVID-19 because they are enjoying God’s special grace in the sanctuary.”
