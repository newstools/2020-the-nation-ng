 A GROUP of youths has launched a campaign tagged: Mask4All to deliver one million free home-made face masks for free to the most vulnerable communities. It hopes to do so before the end of the month and targets 50 million face masks by the end of August. Project Manager Joshua Adeloye said the project started with 250 young tailors who volunteered to deliver 1,000 face masks each weekly and one million face masks by the end of the month. “Through this volunteer process, the group hope to produce and distribute double-ply face masks at about 40 per cent of the market to produce and distribute the face masks at N250 per mask as against the market price of N400 and N500 per mask,” Adeloye said.
