Super Falcons’ striker Chinwendu Ihezuo marked her 23rd anniversary on Thursday but admitted missing the Chinese Women’s  Super League(CWSL). Ihezuo was in good scoring form with Henan Huishang and reportedly scored some seven goals in 14 matches in the last campaign but the CWSL new season was put on hold as a result of the on-going Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. “I have really missed my teammates; missed playing with the team; I  missed the food and  I missed everything related to football as far as my career is concerned as a result of COVID-19,” the free-scoring former BIIK Kazygurt’s striker holed in Lagos told NationSport. “ I’m trying my best to keep fit at home because everywhere is locked-down and there is no way I can go to any pitch to train. “ I do online training to keep in  fit  because Chinese league is very aggressive  and I need  to work extremely  hard to keep fit pending the time  the CWSL will resume after COVID-19.” Though football in COVID-19 worst-hit  China is set to resume, Ihezuo described the pandemic as a global upheaval, adding she has learnt so much lessons. “  I communicate with my club and  I  heard that the CWSL will start soon but no one is sure because of this problem because we are in a time of massive upheaval all over the world.,” noted  Ihezuo who was born in Lagos on 30th April 1997. “ This pandemic has really taught me a lot. “ Now we have e understand that money can’t buy us happiness and we must realize that there is another thing it cannot buy us—time. “We all have 24 hours of the day available to us but how many use all of those hours to do what is truly important to us or humanity? “But staying at home as a result of COVID-19  has forced many people to learn, re-learn or re-ignite their love for cooking and their family which to me is important  lessons,” noted Ihezuo who has featured for the national women’s teams at the FIFA U-17;U-20 and Women’s World Cup.
