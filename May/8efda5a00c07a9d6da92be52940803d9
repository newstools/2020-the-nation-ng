Clearing agents at the Lagos sea ports, on Thursday, embarked on strike over the refusal of terminal operators and shipping firms to waive demurrage and storage charges in line with the directive of the Federal Government over the Coronavirus pandemic. Following the outbreak of  COVID-19,  the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) had directed all port terminals and shipping companies to stop collection of demurrage and storage charges, but surprisingly,  the terminal operators allegedly refused to comply. After several outcry to the NPA, the clearing agents and other freight forwarders under the five major associations in the sector yesterday, held a meeting with the Apapa port manager, Mrs Funmilayo Olotu after which they stopped all their members from taking delivery of cargoes. The Chairman of Apapa chapter of Association of Nigerian Licensed Customs Agents (ANLCA) Chief Dom Onyeka told The Nation that  their  members have stopped writing TDO (Terminal Delivery Order) to take clear containers from the port.
