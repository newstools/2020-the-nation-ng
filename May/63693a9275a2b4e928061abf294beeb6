Shortly after his resignation as the Chief of Staff to Governor Godwin Obaseki, the residence of the ex-CoS, Mr. Francis Taiwo Akerele, was searched by some security operatives. The Department of State Security Services(DSS) has denied involvement in the raid of Akereleâ€™s house. Almost a week after, the question is: Who did it? Could it be by private militia? Certainly, Edo State is a flashpoint to watch by security agencies.
