 President Muhammadu Buhari has given the armed forces an order to rout every trace of banditry and kidnapping from his home state of Katsina. The President gave the order on Sunday during an audience he granted the Chief of General Staff, General Gabriel Olonisakin, at the State House in Abuja. A statement by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, showed that a special operation had already begun in response to the presidential order. According to him, “President  Muhammadu Buhari has authorised the commencement of a major military operation to sweep bandits and kidnappers out of Katsina State.  “A major proactive operation by Special Forces, which details are being kept secret, is now in progress to replace the reactive strikes against insurgent camps. “To give a full effect to the exercise, a planning team is already in the state selecting targets and making preparations for the execution of the ‘unprecedented’ operation. “The Chief of Defence Staff, General Gabriel Olonisakin, who has been measured in issuing official statements on the oncoming exercise, briefed the President on the plan he intends to launch shortly. “President Buhari, who expressed sadness over the recent attacks in the state, extended his condolences to the families of those killed and prayed for the recovery of the injured”, the statement said.
