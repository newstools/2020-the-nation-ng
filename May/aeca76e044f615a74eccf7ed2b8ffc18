 KWARA State Government has completed plans to sell 150,000 cashew and cocoa seedlings to farmers for the 2020 planting season. Other seedlings to be sold to the peasant farmers at subsidised rate include oil palm, plantain, banana, citrus and others. Agriculture and Rural Development Commissioner Mrs. Harriet Afolabi-Oshatimehin told reporters on the sidelines of the launch of 2020 planting season at Alateko in Moro Local Government: “It is actually the commencement of the 2020 planting season. We resolved that as a state, it is necessary for us to kick-start the planting season officially so that people will know that it is time to plant. It is also to let people know that Kwara State of today is different from that of yesterday. Today we are looking at assisting our farmers, looking at mechanised farming as well as how we can help our peasant farmers, who form a large chunk of the farming population.”
