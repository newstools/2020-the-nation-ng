However, in view of the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic which would not allow such a gathering, the University has resolved to conduct an online matriculation for the fresh students. All fresh students are hereby implored to visit the university website: www.uniosun.edu.ng to complete their registration for the online matriculation, complete the matriculation oath form and submit online, all the necessary details required from them,” The university is one of the institutions that have embraced virtual teaching even before the advent of COVID-19 pandemic and ever since, the University has been operating digitally, including holding several of its meetings remotely.
