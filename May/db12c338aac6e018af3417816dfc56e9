Electricity Distribution Companies (DisCos) are re-aligning their operations to meet the yearnings of residential customers nationwide, it was learnt. The idea, it was gathered, was borne out of the need to improve supply of electricity to them in view of the fact that many businesses, especially industries, have partially resumed or are not likely going to resume operation soon, if the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) persists in the country. Industry sources said the statement by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) that the disease might linger till next year, informed the decision of the firms to allocate more volume of electricity  to residential customers and not industrial layouts, which consume quantum volume of electricity  for production of goods and services. The Managing Director of Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKEDC), Adeoye Fadeyibi, said the firm said: “During this period, what we have done is to re-align our network in such a way that power is directed to customers as most industries are shut. We have achieved is evident in increase in supply to residential customers.” Fadeyibi, who spoke during the visit of lawmakers from Lagos State House of Assembly to his office, said  the Board of EKEDC approved N150million for infrastructure and relief items for the victims of COVID-19. He said out of this, EKEDC has donated food items worth N40 million to the state government, and spent over N100 million on procurement of power facilities. Also, the Spokesman of Ikeja Electric, Mr. Felix Ofulue, said the firm has been able to improve power supply to more residential customers that were under his franchise.
