 Nollywood Actress Sola Sobowale has shared some secrets to staying relevant in the Nigerian movie industry. In a recent Instagram chat with comedian, Woli Arole, Sobowale highlighted the measures that have worked in favour of her relevance in the industry for over three decades. The ‘King Of Boys’ lead character says, “the grace of God which can take someone anywhere in life, being a team player, good behavior and character’ will help any personality stay ahead and relevant. Giving an analogy, the award-winning actress said, “In your absence as an actress and your name is mentioned, you would be joining a movie set, the crew is excited to receive you rather than grumble, the director would not want to waste money having a troublemaker on a production set. Anywhere you go in life, you must be of your best behavior, you must know how to carry people along.”  Continuing, she says, “You have to be down to earth, be good, be nice, do unto others what you want others to do to you, philosophy of life is don’t keep taking, know how to give back, and another key is the prayer that is how I have been living my life.” Sobowale grabbed fame in 2001 from when she played the character, Toyin Tomato, in the popular TV drama series, ‘Super Story: Oh Father, Oh Daughter’. In 2019, the screen star was crowned Africa’s best actress at the 15th edition of the African Movie Academy Awards(AMAA) for her lead role in the blockbuster movie ’King of Boys’ which bagged three AMAA awards.
