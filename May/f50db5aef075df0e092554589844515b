 The Edo State Government has said that it never released any photograph of the fleeing COVID-19 patient, a nursing mother, who is wanted for treatment in the state. In a statement, Special Adviser to the Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, Mr. Crusoe Osagie, said this in reaction to a video on social media by someone claiming to have been falsely identified as the nursing mother, who absconded after testing positive for COVID-19. He noted that the lady, whose picture was circulated on social media, is a victim of fake news, stressing that the action by the mischief makers amounts to undermining government’s efforts to track down the nursing mother. According to him, “Our attention has been drawn to a video on social media by a lady who claimed her photos have been circulated on social media wrongly as the nursing mother wanted for COVID-19 treatment by the state government. “It must be stated that when government made the announcement, it only gave the name of the woman in question and her address and never released any photograph of her. “We categorically stated that the nursing mother lives at No. 2 Atoe Idubor Str, off 2nd Ugbor, Benin City. With such detail, it would be impossible to mix up the person we are searching for. “However, we understand that the action of the mischief makers would have caused the lady in the video on social media undue psychological torment. We sympathize with her as, just like us, she is now a victim of fake news. “Therefore, we use this opportunity to reiterate the warning on purveyors of fake news and misinformation to desist from such act, as their actions amount to undermining government’s effort to check the spread of coronavirus. This is punishable under the Quarantine Act Regulations, which is in force in the state.” The governor’s aide urged the general public to continue to provide useful information that would aid in tracking down the COVID-19 patient and her baby so as to safeguard Edo people.
