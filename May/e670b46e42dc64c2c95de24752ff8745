In his bid to tame the threat and further transmission of the global pandemic of COVID-19 in Kano State and promoting safer working environment for health workers, while joining hands with the federal government institutions, Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje has donated Personal Protective Equipments (PPEs), cartons of hand sanitizers, boots, face masks, pump buckets, soaps, among others, to Dala Orthopedic Hospital, Kano. Other items donated to the hospital included hand gloves and other fumigating materials, all in an attempt to cleanse the facility environment and help the facility deal decisively with the pandemic. At a brief official presentation of all the items donated to the management of the hospital yesterday, Governor Ganduje assured the Chief Medical Director, Dr Muhammad Nuhu Salihu, that the state would continue to give its helping hand to the facility. “I am glad to inform you that this federal government facility is performing wonderfully well, as far as healthcare delivery system is concerned. That is why we are always happy to push forward our assistance to the hospital,” he said. The CMD of the hospital, Dr Nuhu, appreciated the gesture disclosing that, “Your Excellency Sir this is the first donation we are receiving since the breaking of the pandemic in the state. And we are extremely happy Sir for the concern and the good gesture.” Similar items were donated to Meccah Specialist Eye Hospital, Gadon Kaya, Kano  when the hospital management thanked the state government for the good caring and concern.
