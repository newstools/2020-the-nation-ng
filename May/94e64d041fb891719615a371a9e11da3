Everton and Nigeria winger Alex Iwobi said  it was a blessing to have played  with Chelsea icon John Obi Mikel and Manchester United striker Odion Ighalo. Mikel spent 14 years with the national team before his retirement from international duty in 2019 and excelled in the midfield role for both club and country during his playing years, helping them to clinch a number of laurels. Iwobi was privileged enough to play alongside Mikel for four years, and explained how he learnt to keep the ball away from opponents even when under pressure from the former Super Eagles captain. “I learnt a lot from Mikel because we play in similar positions. Whenever I’m called I play behind the striker, that’s where he likes to play,” Iwobi said in an Instagram Live. “In training, whilst watching him on the pitch, whilst I’m on the bench watching him, I’ve always learned, the way he’s physically capable to keep the ball in tight situations. “Playing in African culture there’s a lot more physicality, there are a lot more strong duels, the way he’s able to use his body is something I have picked up and try to add to my game.” Ighalo, meanwhile, is regarded as one of the greatest Super Eagles strikers, given his clinical finishing and technical ability.
