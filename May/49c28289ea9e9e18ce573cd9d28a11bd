 KATSINA State COVID-19 Committee has said 51 patients who have tested negative for the Coronavirus pandemic have been discharged from its isolation centres. A member of the Committee and Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Health, Dr Kabiru Mustapha, who made this known on Thursday, also announced that 13 deaths have been recorded. He stated that 285 positive cases have been recorded by the state of yesterday. He urged the media to always visit the Emergency Operation Centre, EOC, which is domiciled at the Headquarters of the State’s Primary Health Care Development Agency, (PHCDA), to keep updated and get the accurate figures. He said: ”As it is, the COVID-19 Committee now hold their meetings through the zones and there is no point to connect everybody at the moment. We really are at very serious position, there are a lot of cases now to handle.” ”I am just coming from the IDP Centre, if you go there you see people being trained on how to manage the facilities. We are doing training for the handlers, ward attendants and other personnel.” He further admitted that 300 samples are yet to be returned, thus affecting the committee’s calculations and challenges as new figures kept streaming in and more samples being sent. On the 13 recorded deaths so far he said that only five were admitted, while the remaining 8 were based on the symptomatic observations carried out after they died and their samples collected and then presented to the hospital.
