 AYODEJI Sotona who currently holds an Irish passport but eligible to play for Nigeria may leave his boyhood club, Manchester United at the end of the current campaign with European clubs lining up for his signature. Sotona, 17 years became an instant hit when he netted the matchwinner for the Red Devils’ Under 18 in their quarter final victory over Wigan Athletic in the FA Youth Cup in February but the striker could be tempted to seek greener pastures for lack of playing opportunities in the senior team. Express Sport reports that clubs from Italy, Spain and Germany have shown genuine interest in the attacker and that Sotona is considering leaving the Old Trafford for more regular football elsewhere. It is reported that Sotona’s chances of playing in the first team may be under threat due to Manchester United’s interest in signing Jude Bellingham of Birmingham City, Jadon Sancho of Borussia Dortmund and Aston Villa’s Jack Grealish. Besides the 17 year old Nigerian, others tipped to leave Manchester United at the end of the season include Jesse Lingard, Angel Gomes and Alexis Sanchez who is currently on loan at Inter Milan. Express Sport also hinted that Man U have run out of patient with Lingard who has not scored in over a year despite the chances Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has given him. Gomes is a young player that feels he has not been given enough chances to thrive at Old Trafford and that with Chelsea and Barcelona allegedly showing interest in him he feels it will be best for him to move to another club. Alexis Sanchez who is also on his way out of Manchester United is yet to prove his mettle at the club and injury has not helped his cause at Inter Milan where he is currently on loan for the rest of the season.
