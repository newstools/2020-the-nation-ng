Dillian Whyte believes rival Anthony Joshua has no intention of fighting him again and says he was ‘used’ by the world heavyweight champion last year. In 2019, Joshua lost on his American debut to Andy Ruiz Jr after originally being scheduled to fight Jarrell Miller – AJ won the December rematch against Ruiz in Saudi Arabia. But Whyte, who himself lost to Joshua in December 2015 having previously beaten him at amateur level, has revealed he thinks the prospect on the table of the two Brits colliding again last year was simply a publicity ploy by Joshua. “Don’t do what Joshua did, saying I refused to fight when he already knew and had told everyone in December 2018 that he had arranged to fight Jarrell Miller June 1 at MSG in New York, before his fake negotiations with me,” a frustrated Whyte told Sky Sports. “I’ve spent more time haggling over the price of tires for one of my cars than they spent negotiating with me on the Wembley fight. A couple of texts and a five-minute meeting. “AJ was trying to use me, to make it look like he wanted the fight and that he wanted to fight in the UK. If he wanted to fight in Wembley, why didn’t he fight Miller there or Ruiz?’ Whyte, nicknamed the Body Snatcher, added that he has made enough effort in trying to force a rematch with Joshua, who knocked him out in the seventh round at the 02 Arena four-and-a-half years ago. “I’ve wanted to fight AJ again for years and they know that. He had an immediate rematch with Ruiz, but won’t give me a rematch. “That’s why I want the WBC belt, so he can’t continue to avoid me and fool the public with fake excuses,” he noted.
