If you are having a soiree and the compere mentions the name Emeka Okonkwo popularly known as E-Money, every attendee’s attention would be diverted to catch a glimpse of his fashion combinations, gait, and his dandy looks. Emeka connotes respect among all and sundry, most especially, for his financial war chest and philanthropic deeds. The sophisticated music label executive has his hands across many business chains from music to agriculture, maritime, cargo, hospitality, procurement, transport, and oil and gas. Anywhere he saunters into, his exotic automobiles and security details are always flashy. A few weeks ago, the Five Star Group boss was thrown off balance as the Inspector General of Police received a petition questioning E-Money’s source of income, flamboyant lifestyle, and unofficial use of Police security details. While the investigation was ongoing, the police escort details attached to him were immediately withdrawn as he was invited for questioning. This generated mixed reactions among his fans and friends. Immediately after the questioning, which proved him innocent, his security details were restored. Taking a new leaf, the socialite deleted all pictures showing his security details opening his car door for him on his Instagram page. He also vowed to stop posting pictures of his security details on social media. An insider however insisted that E-Money is a law-abiding citizen and not the only one flaunting his wealth on social media as well as his security details. The insider insists that it has a political undertone. “Some people think he would be contesting for a political post in his native state. They want to clip his growing influence before it gets out of hand. Since he threw the doors of his palatial country home in Imo open, he has become a threat to many people. The truth is that Emeka is not even delving into politics anytime soon,” the insider insisted.
