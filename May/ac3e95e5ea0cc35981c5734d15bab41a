The English Premier League (EPL) can show more matches on free-to-air television (TV) platforms once it resumes, a UK minister, Oliver Dowden, said on Monday. Dowden, head of the department for digital, culture, media and sport, said this should include during the normally protected 1500 BST slot on a Saturday. He said making the games available on free platforms could help to prevent fans from turning up outside the stadium for games which are being shown behind closed doors. “It is likely to (resume) mid-June at the earliest,” he said. “It will be a good thing to do if we can and I’m also looking as we do it at increasing the number of matches that can be free to air so people won’t be tempted to leave their homes to watch it. “There is a rule at the moment that at 3 p.m. you can’t show matches on TV because people were watching it in the football stadiums. “Clearly that is not going to be the case anymore, so some of those slots may be available for free-to-air.” (Reuters/NAN)
