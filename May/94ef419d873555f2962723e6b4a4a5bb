 The Peoples Democratic Party, Osun State, has described the vindication of the party’s 2018 governorship candidate, Senator Ademola Adeleke, by the Federal High Court as a victory over gangsterism. The Federal High Court sitting in Abuja had on Friday discharged Senator Adeleke from all allegations of examination malpractices levelled against him alongside four others. In a statement by the PDP State Publicity Secretary, Hon Sunday Bisi, on Friday said, “We welcome with gratitude to almighty God, the judicial victory of the candidate of the party in the 2018 governorship election in the state. It is a victory over pedestrian gangsterism.” The party also congratulated Senator Adeleke over the verdict of the court discharging and acquitting from all charges.  The statement read, “The PDP appeals to its members in the state to close ranks at all levels and build on the joyous feat achieved by the immediate past Senator of Osun West, to steady the ship of the party for the ultimate victory ahead. “We appeal to Senator Ademola Adeleke not to be discouraged in his efforts at exposing and defeating all forces of evil, who out of collaborative greed, have resorted to mindless lies, wicked trickery and subterfuge to perpetuate their trade of looting the state to ground zero and subjecting the helpless populace to undue hardship while reducing the state to a laughing stock amongst its peers in the country. “The victory is deserving and a pointer to the fact that no matter how long a lie travels, it will surely crash on the rock of truth and justice,” the party said.
