President Muhammadu Buhari has said the legacy of fairness, integrity and forthrightness that the late Justice Isiaka Oluwa was known for in his administration of justice would live for ages to come. President Buhari stated this in his message of condolence to the people and government of Lagos State, as well as the family, friends and professional colleagues, which he sent out on Sunday. The President’s message, contained in a statement issued by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr Femi Adesina, also charged the Lagos State Government, especially the Ministry of Justice, to institutionalise Justice Oluwa’s legacies and works. “President Muhammadu Buhari commiserates with government and people of Lagos State over the passing of Justice Isiaka Isola Oluwa, 102, whose legacy of fairness, integrity and forthrightness in administering justice continues to reverberate long after retirement. “President Buhari sends condolences to family of the late Justice of the State High Court, his friends and professional colleagues, affirming that his meritorious public service was most remarkable, especially contributions to the growth of education as Pro-Chancellor of Lagos State University and Chairman of Governing Council. “The President believes Justice Oluwa’s personal attributes of simple, disciplined and incorruptible lifestyle left an indelible mark on the Lagos State Judiciary, and enabled his subsequent appointments to sensitive positions, urging the Lagos State Government, particularly the Ministry of Justice to institutionalize the good works of the legal luminary. “President Buhari prays that the almighty God will receive the soul of the centenarian, and comfort his family”, the statement said.
