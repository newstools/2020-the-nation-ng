 Odion Ighalo has opened up on how the advice he has received from Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has made him a better player. Ighalo moved to Old Trafford in the January window on loan from Shanghai Shenhua to provide cover for injured striker Marcus Rashford. And the 30-year-old has settled quickly with his boyhood club, scoring four goals and providing one assist in his first eight games for the Red Devils. “When I moved to United, I learned a few things from him,” Ighalo told MUTV. “During games – there was even a game I scored in, and he said: ‘You should have scored more if you do this or do that’. “I thought about it and I know if I would have done what Ole said, I would have scored more.  “ He says: ‘You’re a striker, take the chance’. “So I’ve learnt a lot from him, in terms of positioning and how to do one or two things in a game.” Ighalo is well aware that he is receiving guidance from one of the Red Devils’ all-time goal scoring greats – who scored 91 Premier League goals for the club – and as a forward, he believes this gives him an edge. He added: “As a striker, it’s good when a striker is coaching you. And, as a striker, you benefit even more than the defenders. “He is someone who has scored goals for a long time and has done a lot for United, so it’s good to learn from him.”
