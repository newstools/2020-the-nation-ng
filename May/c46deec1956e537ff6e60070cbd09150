Our Reporter Deputy Speaker of Delta State House of Assembly Christopher Ochor has praised the Governor Ifeanyi Okowa administration for the proposed security outfit, Operation Delta Hawk. At a news conference on Wednesday, Ochor, through his Press Secretary, Emmanuel Enebeli, described Operation Delta Hawk as a bold step in checking insecurity. He solicited support for the outfit in achieving its objectives. Ochor, who represents Ukwani state constituency, noted that insecurity had been a cause of concern to the government, resulting in its ‘wise decision’ to set up the outfit. The lawmaker said establishing the security outfit was in sync with good governance and quality service delivery to the people, which included security of life and property. He said: “The announcement by the government that plans had been concluded for the establishment of a state security outfit, to be codenamed Operation Delta Hawk, is a welcome development. Recall that this was part of decisions the Southsouth Governors’ Forum, in its last meeting in Asaba, agreed to. And as chairman of the forum, the state is implementing the decision in the zone. “Without protection of lives and properties, there is nothing like good governance. We had witnessed serious security threats recently. Lives and properties have been lost and are being lost virtually every other day. We all have to support this proposal for general good. “The governor’s move has been a policy of his administration since inception to promote peace and security; it was one of the motives behind the SMART Agenda for a Stronger Delta policies, which have been demonstrated by setting up of the Security and Peace Committee with membership drawn from the league of eminent citizens of the state.”
