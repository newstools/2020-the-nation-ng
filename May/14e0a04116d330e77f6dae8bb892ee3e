The Ewi of Ado-Ekiti, Oba Rufus Adejugbe Aladesanmi, has debunked a rumour that he is battling a life-threatening ailment. There has been insinuation since last week that Oba Aladesanmi is battling alleged chronic illness triggered by the closure of Ojaâ€™ ba market, which many believe is contrary to the age-long custom and tradition of the ancient town. The popular market has been shut down by the Ekiti State Government since the outbreak of Covid-19 to contain the spread of the pandemic. The first-class monarch, in a statement in Ado-Ekiti yesterday, said he is hale and hearty, urging the people to disregard what he described as fictitious and outright falsehood.
