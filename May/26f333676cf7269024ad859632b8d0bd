The Provost of Nwafor Orizu College of Education, Nzugbe, Anambra State, Dr Ifeyinwa Osegbo said the institution would redouble its efforts on resumption to ensure it covered the lost grounds created by the lockdown occasioned by the Covid-19 pandemic. Osegbo said this when she led the institution’s delegation to present cartons of sanitizers, handwash, and soaps to the state government as part of its contributions to combat the Covid-19 scourge. She regretted the disruption of the school’s examinations by the pandemic, but counseled students to be prepared for intensive studies on resumption. She said, “The last six weeks of vacation occasioned by lockdown has not been easy, although we visit the school twice in a week to maintain skeletal services. “In fact, we were having exams when the pandemic struck. But we had to key into the lockdown because it is a necessity to save lives. We want to avoid the risk of jeopardizing the lives of the students. “This is a global challenge which is not peculiar to Nigeria or the state. As the state government is gradually relaxing the lockdown, maybe schools will also open. “We will tackle our studies with every sense of responsibility that it requires, which means we will double our efforts. I doubt if we’ll have any other holidays immediately we start so we can cover up what we’ve lost,” she said. The Provost said the donated items, comprising 20 cartons of sanitizers, 10 cartons of handwash and 10 cartons of soap were combination of local and foreign production. Responding, the secretary to the state government, Prof. Solo Chukwulobelu thanked the institution for the gesture, assuring that the donation would be judiciously utilized.
