 Big Brother Naija ex-housemate, Omashola Oburo, has said that Nigerians enjoy engaging in negativity in comparison to citizens of other countries. The former reality TV star aired his opinion during a live chat on Instagram with fellow ex-housemate, Natacha Akide aka Tacha. In his words, Omashola said; “From Tanzania to Kenya, from South Africa, from London, all they preach is that we love you. Love from Ghana, love from Kenya, love from South Africa, you doing good, God bless you but Nigerians want to talk about negativity, the bad things but be positive for once all we preach is love, not war”.  He added that fans should learn not to fight celebrities notwithstanding who they support. “I don’t care if you’re supporting one person or the other, If you wan fight, fight person because you get personal biffs with the person,” he said. Omashola was among the finalists at the 2019 Big Brother Naija reality TV show. He came out of the Big Brother’s House holding the fourth position.
