 THE Nigeria Correctional Service in Ondo State has refused to admit three of the four suspected killers of Mrs Funke Olakunri, daughter of elder statesman Pa Reuben Fasoranti after one of them, Adamu Adamu, tested positive for COVID-19. Adamu had last week attempted to escape from the Infectious Disease Hospital where he is being  treated. The other three suspects tested negative. Governor Rotimi Akeredolu urged the authorities of the correctional centre to immediately receive the suspects into custody as directed by the law court. Speaking at a press briefing, Akeredolu said the state recorded three new cases last week. Akeredolu said the state now has 16 confirmed cases with six successfully treated and discharged while nine are receiving treatment. He said the state was dealing more with imported cases of COVID-19 than with community transmission. On the influx of young people from some northern states, the governor said, “They are mostly destitutes and are without doubt very vulnerable to the COVID-19 infection. “Their massive influx into other states, particularly in southwest coinciding with the spread of COVID-19 constitutes a great threat in many respects and calls for concern. Government has set up an effective and already running system of containment which returns the Almajirai to their states of origin.”
