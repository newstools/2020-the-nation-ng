 An Igbosere High Court, Lagos, Tuesday fixed July 28 for the arraignment of an Oyo State council official Badmus Adesina and a lawyer, Ibukunoluwa Konu, who allegedly stole N167,886,591,60 from a dead man. Justice O. Ogunbiyi adjourned till the date following the absence of first defendant Adesina, an Ibadan resident. Only Konu was present in court. He noted that the adjournment was also in keeping with the COVID-19 regulations of the Lagos State Judiciary. Adesina, according to his counsel Mr O. Agboola, was unable to attend court because of the national ban on interstate travel as a measure to check the spread of the novel coronavirus pandemic. According to the January 24 four-count charge filed by the police, Adesina, 59, and Konu, 44, conspired and committed the offences of stealing, forgery and making documents without authority between 2009 and 2019. Prosecution counsel Williams Tijani of the Force Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (FCIID) Ikoyi, alleged that the defendants stole N167,886,591,60 from the Estate of the late Godfrey Kwashie Konu. Tijani said within the same period between Ibadan and Lagos, both defendants “did forge a letter of attestation of marriage certificate purportedly issued from Ibadan South East Local Government of Oyo State and a letter captioned ‘Marriage Certificate’ issued from a Magistrate Court in Ibadan…” The prosecution alleged that both men, “with intent to defraud, without lawful authority or excuse make,” signed or executed the forged letter of attestation of Marriage Certificate. According to the Police, the offences contravened and were punishable under Sections 280, 287, 363, 365, 370 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.
