The National Parents Teachers Association of Nigeria (NAPTAN), known as PTA, has said the Federal Government home-grown school programme will fail if parents and teachers are not involved. The Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development had announced that it would commence the Home-Grown School Programme in Abuja, Lagos and Ogun states before it would extend to other states. A statement by the National Public Relations officer of the association, Dr Ekundayo Precious, which was made available to The Nation yesterday in Osogbo, stated that non-inclusion of parents and teachers in the programme will give way to corruption. He noted that parents are one of the key pillars and stakeholders in the educational sector and there is no policy that affects children that will not affect the parents directly or indirectly.
