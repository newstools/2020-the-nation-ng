 MUSIC director and cinematographer Clarence Peters has been arrested by police in Lagos over the death of dancer Love Divines alias Kodak. Kodak was said to have been electrocuted while charging and using her iphone on Wednesday at Peters’ Omole Phase One, Lagos home. Also arrested were other persons in the house at the time the dancer died. Kodak was alleged to have operated the plugged phone while sitting almost naked on the door railings with no footwear on. Initial reports that she died on the set of a music video have been debunked. The Nation learnt yesterday that Peters was invited at the State Criminal Intelligence and Investigation Department (SCIID), Panti, Yaba for questioning on Saturday night and has been detained since then. Police spokesman Bala Elkana confirmed the arrest of Clarence Peters, adding that the command was investigating the circumstances that led to the dancer’s death, including possible murder. Elkana said Peters and all those who were at his residence when the incident occurred have been invited for questioning, adding that he would not be able to give  details at the moment.
