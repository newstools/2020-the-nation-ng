The management of Bayero University Kano,which constituted BUK Emergency Ventilator Team has developed a prototype ventilator machine in its efforts at fighting COVID-19 pandemic. The​ locally produced ventilator has​ the capacity of operating in two modes. According to chairman of BUK Emergency Ventilator Team, Prof. Ibrahim Abdullahi of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, the idea behind the production was for the university to contribute its quota in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic. He added: “Due to the present COVID-19 pandemic, the University saw the need to contribute to the fight against the deadly pandemic. We came up with this idea. “The ventilator operates in two modes. In mode one, the ventilator breezes for the patients. In mode two, the ventilator complements the breezing for the patients.” He added the ventilator also has a controller that regulates breezing according to the patient’s requirement. “It has ranges for the clinician to tune a particular breezing frequency to support the life of the patient,” he added. Abdullahi further stated: “We produced one unit of the ventilator at the cost of N500, 000. We used locally available material and locally available technology.” He said BUK is making plans for mass and commercial production of the ventilator, adding “in the next step, we will produce and test for animals. What we have now is the prototype. “We are making plans to engage companies so that we can go into mass production. For now, as a university, we produce in batches. We shall soon partner with companies for commercial production.”
