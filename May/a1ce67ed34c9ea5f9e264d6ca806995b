The last has not been heard of the impeccable qualities which made President Muhammadu Buhari to appoint Prof. Ibrahim Agboola Gambari as his Chief of Staff. Part of the profiling indicated that despite his exposures to many top positions, he does not own a house or an office in the posh Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. As at the time he was appointed, he was perching in a friendâ€™s house. Even the office his NGO was using in Abuja came in handy. Gambari lives a simple and austere life. No wonder, the President opted for a like mind, who is apolitical.
