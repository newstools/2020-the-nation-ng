The Natural Oil and Gas Suppliers Association of Nigeria (NOGASA), Kaduna State branch, said on Monday that its members had lost 34 trucks and large quantities of Kerosene and automotive Gas to thieves operating along Kaduna-Zaria and Tashan-Yari axis in the state. Adamu Danjuma, the state Chairman of the association, made the disclosure when he visited the Kaduna Command of Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC). He said that the oil products and vehicles were stolen from September 2019 to date. “The syndicates adopt strategies like forceful seizure, alteration of documents, change of vehicles number plates or even colours to enable them evade authorities,” the chairman was quoted as saying in a statement by the NSCDC. The statement was issued by Orndiir Terzungwe, Public Relations Officer of the command. The chairman, along with officials of the association, sought for closer collaboration with the NSCDC to apprehend the perpetrators. He expressed optimism that the collaboration would help end oil theft including vandalism of pipelines and other unethical practices. Responding, State Commandant of NSCDC, Babangida Dutsinma, pledged to work with the association to end the menace and ensure sanity and discipline in the oil business. Dutsinma reiterated the commitment of the command to the protection of petroleum installations and assets in the state. (NAN)
