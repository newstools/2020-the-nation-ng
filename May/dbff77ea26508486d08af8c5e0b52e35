COVID-19 could become endemic in the same way as HIV and populations around the world will have to learn to live with it, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: “The trajectory is in our hands, and it’s everybody’s business and we should all contribute to stop this pandemic. “Many countries would like to get out of the different measures but our recommendation is still the alert at any country should be at the highest level possible.” “It is important to put this on the table: this virus may become just another endemic virus in our communities, and this virus may never go away. “HIV has not gone away but we have come to terms with the virus,” WHO emergencies expert Mike Ryan revealed during an online briefing. “I think it is important we are realistic and I don’t think anyone can predict when this disease will disappear. I think there are no promises in this and there are no dates. This disease may settle into a long problem, or it may not be,” he added. More than 100 potential vaccines are being developed, including several in clinical trials, but experts have underscored the difficulties of finding ones effective against coronavirus.
