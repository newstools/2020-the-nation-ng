Not less than 14,000 youths in the Badagry Local Government Area are to be fed to cushion the effects of the partial lockdown to curtail the spread of coronavirus  in Lagos State. The chairman of the local government, Hon. Olusegun Onilude, said this during the flag-off of the first phase of the Free Youths Feeding Programme which kicked off during the week in the council areas. He said the programme in the council areas was to complement the exemplary leadership efforts of the governor of Lagos State, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, in alleviating the economic hardship which the partial lock down order to curtail the spread of the corona virus COVID 19 pandemic has brought on the people of Badagry by providing free meals for the youths in the council areas. Onilude noted that the first phase of the programme, which took place during the week in 35 locations of the ten wards of the local government area, catered for 7,000 youths. ”The ten wards are divided into 35 locations of 200 youths per location. This means 7,000 youths will be offered free meals in the first phase of the programme. This feeding programme of the local government is meant to cater for the youths at the locations who could not benefit from the state government’s Free Youths Feeding Programme . The essence of this programme is also to empower our local food vendors and put food on the tables of our youths that are probably out of work at this period of partial lockdown and fasting,” he said.
