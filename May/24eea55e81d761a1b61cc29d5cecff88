  A governorship aspirant of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ondo State, Dapo Adelegan, has pledged to serve only one term of four years, if elected as governor in the October governorship election Adelegan, who is a marketing communication and PR expert, said, he would serve only one term because he will be completing the second term of incumbent Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu as they both hail from Owo in Ondo North senatorial district. Speaking with The Nation, in Akure, Adelegan urged aspirants from other senatorial districts to allow another Owo son to complete the second term of Akeredolu. Adelegan noted that it would take another 40 years for another Owo son to emerge as Ondo governor whether Akeredolu gets a second term ticket or not. Explaining what he would do differently as governor, Adelegan said he would bring on new capacities and global exposure to galvanise Ondo people for the purpose of improving the fortunes of the state. He said, “I am committed to finishing the term of Ondo North. That is why we are asking Ondo people to give us the opportunity that the North should be allowed to complete its two-term. “We are speaking to our people in the North that one person has done four years, and we have an opportunity to try another hand for maximum impact. After it leaves Owo, it may not come back again for another 40 years. “Even if it comes back to the North, it is going to Akoko and not Owo before it goes to the South, Central and then back to the North.”
