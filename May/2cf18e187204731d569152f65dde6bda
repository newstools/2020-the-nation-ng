Obajeu Royal Family of Otun-Ekiti in Ekiti State has sued Governor Kayode Fayemi for alleged imposition of a monarch. The stool of Oore, one of the 16 most prominent Pelupelu Obas in Ekiti became vacant after the demise of Oba Adedapo Popoola in October. A suit filed at the High Court, Ado Ekiti Division, by Chief Adeleke Atolagbe of Obajeu Ruling House, faulted the alleged appointment by the government at Iyaaba Royal Dynasty against the tradition of rotation. Joined in the suit are Fayemi (1st defendant), Deputy Governor Bisi Egbeyemi (2nd defendant), attorney general and Justice commissioner (3rd defendant), secretary in Moba Local Government (4th defendant), Obanla of Otun Chief Adeniran Odeniyi (5th defendant ) and Head of Iyaaba Ruling House Chief Ateere Folorunso (6th defendant). An affidavit of urgency attached to the motion on notice with and deposed to by Olakanmi Falade said the government erred in law by not abiding by the tradition and allowing the kingmakers to make input to select a king from the appropriate lineage. The claimant contended that by virtue of the principle of rotation, Obajeu was the natural choice, urging the government to reverse its action to prevent acting ultra vires of its powers as stipulated by the Ekiti State Chieftaincy Law.
