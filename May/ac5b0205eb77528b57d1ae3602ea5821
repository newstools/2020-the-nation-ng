 Ebonyi Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi has stated there may be another lockdown if Nigeria is to defeat coronavirus. He stated this during a live broadcast to residents on Wednesday. He attributed the increasing cases of the virus in the state to the easing of the lockdown, especially in Lagos. He said: “I want to commend Mr. President in the manner and wisdom he is handling this pandemic. You see, when the lockdown was there the cases were trickling in but when the lockdown was relaxed, the cases are coming in surprising manner”. “It is the Nigerian people that will advise themselves to isolate, to be careful. I expect another serious lockdown if the cases continue to increase like this and this will be by consensus agreement of the general public. We have to lockdown to defeat this monster that is called COVID-19”. The Governor also said the latest four cases, which took Ebonyi’s tally to 13 are all returnees. “We have recorded 13 coronavirus cases shockingly and surprisingly in Ebonyi state now. The first treatment centre has a total of 26 facility rooms and in the next seven days, we will be opening ultramodern emergency hospital ward we were constructing but now, we are turning it to 300-bed isolation centre here in Abakaliki,” he stressed. Umahi also revealed that one of the patients, a three- year- old child has recovered and was discharged after he tested negative twice.
