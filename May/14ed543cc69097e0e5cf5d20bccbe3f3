ALL Progressives Congress (APC) in Abia South has backed the appointment of Prince Paul Ikonne as executive secretary of National Agriculture Land Development Authority (NALDA). The party described Ikonne as a thorough-bred with vast knowledge in management of human resources. APC said his years as a public office holder and administrator aid him in implementing the presidential agricultural policies. Spokesman and Zonal Chairman Chikezirim Orji said Ikonne’s appointment would boost the moral and confidence of party members. He said: “We thank Mr. President for Ikonne’s appointment as the executive secretary of National Agriculture, Land Development Authority (NALDA). “President Muhammadu Buhari has been seen as anti-Igbo, but Ikonne’s appointment has shown that President Buhari is a lover of the Igbo people, and this singular act has shown us that President Buhari takes his time to choose the best hands that will drive his vision and agenda for the good of Nigerians…”
