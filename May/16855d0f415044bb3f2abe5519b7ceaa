To prevent food security crises after the covid-19  pandemic in the country, the Federal Government has promised to provide 12 million 50 kg bags of NPK fertiliser ahead of this year’s rainy season farming to be sold at subsidised price. The Chairman Presidential Fertiliser Initiative (PFI), Alhaji Muhammed Badaru Abubakar, said at a briefing. He said his committee had  imported enough phosphate and potash needed for the production of the fertiliser while urea and fillers were being sourced locally. According to Abubakar, who is also the Jigawa State Governor, said to tackle food crises, President Muhammadu Buhari made some policies which include massive procurement of fertiliser to sell at the subsidised price of N5, 000 only. The PFI committee chair added that between 2016 and last year, Buhari under the initiative delivered no fewer than 19 million 50 kg bags of NPK 20:10:10 fertiliser from two blending plants across 13 states. He stated further that the PFI was facing the problem of evacaution and despatch in Rivers State caused by the lockdown imposed on intra-state travels due to the pandemic. Abubakar maintained that despite the prevailing constrains, 19 out of the 29 participating blending plants across the country are active while other blenders are expected to ramp up after completing their security clearance and documentations.
