A consulting and integration firm Digital Encode, has been licensed under the Data Protection Compliance Organisations (DPCO) by the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA). With this licence, the firm is recognised by NITDA to provide training, auditing, and consulting services throughout the country in line with the Nigeria Data Protection regulation (NDPR) principles. On January 25, last year, NDPR was issued by NITDA with the objectives of protecting the privacy rights and freedoms of citizens, on the one hand, and the promotion of local and foreign investments in the digital economy by safeguarding the information systems infrastructure against breaches and implementing internationally compatible rules. As a DPCO, Digital Encode is expected to verify self-audits prior to submission to NITDA. This is a means of decentralising compliance activities for more efficiency. Its Co-founder and Chief Operating Officer, Dr. Peter Adewale Obadare, expressed gratitude to the management of NITDA led by Malam Kashif Abdullahi, for the confidence reposed in the organisation. Obadare, who doubles as the Director of Governance, Risk and Compliance, said as a pan-African cyber security, Digital Encode will continue to keep assisting individuals and businesses protect their information assets. Also, the Chief Technical of Digital Encode, Dr. Seyi Akindeinde, said the licence is a testament to the firm’s unique methodology rooted in professionalism. Akindeinde, who is also the Chief Research Officer and Director of Security Assurance at Digital Encode, said while assisting firms to achieve the data protection goals through a well-defined secure process, Digital Encode will continue to translate strategic business objectives into sound, achievable technology solutions. “This approach ensures that the technology never obscures the business goals,” he said.
