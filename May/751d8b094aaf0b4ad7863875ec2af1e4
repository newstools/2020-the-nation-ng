 For political exigency, some governors have defied the  advisory from the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 and went ahead to ease the lockdown in their states by reopening churches and mosques. Their decisions have caused serious  headache for PTF members because such recalcitrance is at variance with the facts and figures on coronavirus pandemic in their states. One of the affected governors, according to records, does not regularly attend the meetings of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF).
