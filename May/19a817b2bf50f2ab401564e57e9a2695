 Ecobank Nigeria has reiterated that its agency scheme, known as Xpress Points, is building entrepreneurs and pushing financial inclusion to the large unbanked and under-banked population. The Ecobank Xpress Point enables eligible agents to carry out financial transactions for Ecobank and earn commission. The consumer experience is very good as customers can do simple deposit, payment and transfers in their own neighbourhood rather than travel for hours to a bank branch. Ecobank Xpress Points is also a channel that can be used for the deployment of national social intervention programmes of the government. The aim of the Xpress Point is to let every Nigerian and household have access to Ecobank services within their neoghbourhood to provide easy banking. Head, Agency Banking, Ecobank Nigeria, Nike Kolawole, said unemployed and retired persons should avail themselves the opportunity to earn extra income by keying into services offered by the bank as Xpress point agents. According to her, the Ecobank Xpress point, which are in various neighbourhoods across the country, are well-positioned to facilitate basic financial transactions, with the process and services simplified to attend to a broad spectrum of the society. She further said agency banking  brings about economic and youth empowerment by way of job creation and earning extra income, adding that small savers could easily do their savings at home or near their home.
