 Kano Government has insisted Eid Fitri prayers will hold in mosques across the state on Sallah Day with strict adherence to COVID-19 protocols. Governor Abdullahi Ganduje last Tuesday approved open prayers to mark the Eid Fitri. Ganduje, who also approved Sunday service for Christians, mapped out protocols during the religious gatherings. Reacting to Federal Government’s directive that religious gatherings should not take place during lockdown, Commissioner for Information, Malam Muhammad Garba, said Kano has no choice but to go ahead with approval for the Eid Fitri prayers. According to him: “Our people will pray in mosques. We have already decided on this issue and strategies on how to ensure their safety have been put in place. “Kano state government has been working hand-in-hand with the Federal Government in our efforts to curtail the spread of coronavirus. “The COVID-19 protocols will be strictly adhered to by worshippers at the Eid- prayer ground. “We have taken the decision for them to conduct Eid prayers in the state. To change gear now could amount to another thing and it makes no meaning.” He added: “You are also aware that already, operational guidelines for the controlled easing of the pandemic-induced restriction has been released. “Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje has directed the state Hisbah Board
to hold meeting with Imams and deploy its personnel to Friday (Juma’at mosques)
across the state to ensure that worshipers comply with personal hygiene through
maintaining social distancing, hand washing with soap, use of hand sanitizers
and face masks.” A crucial security meeting is ongoing at the Government House with service chiefs in attendance. The purpose of the meeting, presided over by Ganduje, may not be unconnected with a final decision on religious gatherings.
