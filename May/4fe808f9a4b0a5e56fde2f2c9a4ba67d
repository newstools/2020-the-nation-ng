Barely 48 hours after the returned from a High Court in Anambra over their age- long land tussle, indigenes of Abba and Ukpo communities have resumed hostilities in the area. While Abba is in Njikoka local government area of Anambra State, Ukpo is in Dunukofia Council Area but they are neighbors. Residents of Abba woke up on Thursday to see some bulldozers believed to be from Ukpo, demolishing the country home of a business mogul in the area, Chief Goddy Nweke. The situation has created tension in the two local government areas with truck load of policemen deployed to the place.
One of the community leaders from Abba, Mr. Alex Maduka, told The Nation elders in the community had to prevail on the restive youths to remain calm. He said the angry youths had spoiled for a full blown war with their neighbours When contacted, the Anambra State Police Commissioner, John Abang, said what he knew was that Ukpo people had a Court judgement against Abba,adding ” perhaps, it was what they wanted to enforce today.” Another Senior Police Officer, a Chief Supritendent of Police, CSP, who pleaded anonymity, confirmed the development. He said the Command deployed men to prevent any break down of law and order, adding that their duty was to protect lives and property In February 2019, Abba main market and parts of Abba Secondary School were demolished in such circumstances. Maduka claimed that the demolitions had made indigenes of Abba lose millions and brought so much pains among the people. He wondered why security operatives and the State Government had not taken decisive actions to end the crisis between Abba and Ukpo, which had lingered for about 50 years. According to him: “We persuaded our people who came out yesterday not to retaliate because the police are not on our side as any action we take might result in human casualties. “In as much as we do not want to engage Ukpo people in physical confrontation, we will continue to engage them in court until we get justice.”
