Nigeria’s Ambassador to the Republic of Togo, Ambassador Olusola Iji, has said he has the support of members of the All Progressives Congress at the grassroot to contest for the September governorship election. Ambassador Iji who has declared intention to run for Governor on the platform of the APC as well as distributed campaign vehicles to his mobilizers said he is determined to defeat Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu to become the next Governor by January 2021. Iji said he saw the sufferings of Ondo APC members when his campaign leaders visited the 18 local government areas and produced a mind blowing report. Speaking through his Director of Media Services, Ambasssdor Iji said the APC members lamented that they have been sidelined on party matters. He said his long sought reconciliation of Ondo APC members has started yielding results following the large numbers of party members queuing behind his quest to achieve unity in the party. Ambassador Iji stated that he has solid campaign structures in all the 18 local government areas and that his campaign coordinators were working hard to ensure vibrant political support for his aspiration. Iji said he has reached out to former and current party leaders playing ‘Sidon look’ politics, elders, opinion moulders and other critical stakeholders. According to him: “Statistics obtained from party members painted vivid pictures of APC members pitiable sufferings caused by their total neglect by the Akeredolu administration. “APC leaders, Ward and local government executive members pitiably lamented their lots saying there was absence of political patronage. “The decision of APC members at the grassroot level to pitch tent with Ambassador Iji was based on the robust and all inclusive style the Ambassador has adopted.”
