Arondizuogu Patriotic Union and Elveden Resources wish to inform all indigenes of Arondizuogu home and abroad and all intending guests that the Ikeji Heritage Festival 2020 has been suspended due to the novel Coronavirus pandemic and attendant lockdown order and ban on gatherings above 20 persons by the Federal and State Governments to contain the spread. It is no longer news that since Nigeria recorded its index case, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Nigeria and across States have continued to increase, hence, all masquerade parades, carnivals, and jamborees associated with the celebration of the Ikeji Arondizuogu Heritage Festival 2020 remain suspended until a time advisable by the authorities. Anyone violating government order will be made to face the full weight of the law. To all our sponsors and partners, we will update you with developments as they unfold. We appeal with you all to continue to keep faith with us.  May God continue to shield us from all evil.
