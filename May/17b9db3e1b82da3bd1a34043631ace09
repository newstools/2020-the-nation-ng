The Medical Director, Stella Obasanjo Hospital, Dr. Osagie Ebonwonyi, has said the hospital is well-equipped to manage coronavirus (COVID-19) patients with ample support from the Edo State Government. Speaking to journalists in Benin City, Dr. Ebonwonyi urged residents to comply with government directives to curtail the spread of COVID-19 in the state. He noted, “The pandemic is a serious issue, as government is doing everything possible to limit the spread of the disease in the state. A massive renovation is still ongoing at the hospital to expand the bedspace for isolation of patients. For now, we have 42 beds.” Dr. Ebonwonyi said the isolation centre at the Stella Obasanjo hospital is well equipped to manage COVID-19 patients, noting, “We have over 36 patients here and they are all responding to treatment. We are happy to say we have not recorded any death in this isolation centre.” He expressed appreciation to the state government for equipping the hospital with the required resources for the treatment of COVID-19, including Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) as well as qualified staff to run the centre. “COVID-19 is not a death sentence, as early detection and treatment is very important,” he said. Chairman, Infection Prevention Control (IPC)at the Stella Obasanjo Hospital, Dr. Isaac Omorogiuwa said the IPC Unit of COVID-19 is very active. “Apart from testing for the virus, we also counsel our patients whether they come out positive or not. Some of them already have psychological worries; we need to counsel them against worries and try to keep them calm irrespective of the outcome of the result,” he said. Dr. Omorogiuwa added, “As doctors, we do our best to ensure we are not infected by the virus. We have a doffing centre, where materials and waste from the facility are incinerated. We have three incinerators in the facility.”
