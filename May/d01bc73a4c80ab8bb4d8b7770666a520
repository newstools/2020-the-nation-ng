A BILL to establish Neighbourhood Safety Corps in Akwa Ibom State has passed second reading in the Assembly. The bill, entitled: “Akwa Ibom State Neighbourhood Safety Corps Agency Bill”, will provide for the establishment of a regulatory framework for neighborhood safety corps. Leading debate at plenary, lead sponsor Mr Anietie Eka would checkmate crime and criminal activities. Eka added that the bill would support the formal security network to do its work effectively.
