 One of the governorship aspirant in Ondo state, Mrs Jumoke Ajasin-Anifowose has distanced herself from a publication that stated that some aspirants in the Unity Forum have agreed to cede the governorship to Ondo North senatorial district. The Unity Forum headed Alhaji Alli Olanusi has vowed to unseat Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu but the forum has been unable to agree on a consensus aspirant as over 12 APC chieftains in the forum have indicated interest to contest. Dr Segun Abraham who is one of the governorship aspirant had in a statement he signed alongside nine aspirants under the Unity Forum said they agreed to support aspirant from Ondo North. But Mrs Anifowose whose name appeared as one of the signatories in the statement expressed surprise that her name could be used as signatory without her consent. Anifowose condemned the act and called for immediate rejoinder of the publication. Her words, “I didn’t participate in the decision of the meeting as published. If I didn’t, I wonder why my name should be included as a signatory to same “Whoever is responsible for this, should please go back to the press and make necessary correction. Exactly what you blamed Dr Abraham for is what you have resorted to. “I am for a strong and peaceful APC of which the Stakeholders in the unity forum are part and parcel”. Mrs Anifowose however called for a common front at ensuring victory for the APC in the October 10, 2020 date as announced by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).
