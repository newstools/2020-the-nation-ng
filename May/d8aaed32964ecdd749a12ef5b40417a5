 The Ogun government says it will extend the current lockdown in the state by another one week. Governor Dapo Abiodun made this known while addressing journalists on Friday evening in Abeokuta. He said it had become expedient to further add another week to the lockdown in view of the rising number of COVID-19 cases in the state. He attributed the rise in the number of cases to the expanded testing capacity of the state, which is 450 per day, and stubborn residents who have continued to flout orders put in place to flatten the curve of the virus. He noted that the relaxation windows of lockdown would follow the existing pattern of Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays till May 24. “Consequently in view of the evidence of community transmission and poor compliance with the lockdown measures, we are constrained to extend the lockdown for another week till Sunday 24th of May. “The current pattern of lockdown, with relaxation windows from 7.00a.m. to 5.00p.m. on Monday, Wednesday and Friday continues. “We must also bear in mind that the daily curfew from 8p.m. to 6a.m. and the ban on non-essential inter-state travel as directed by Mr President still stands,” he said. Abiodun, however, said the level of compliance with the lockdown measures would continue to be monitored. “Hopefully, there will be positive developments that will enable us further ease the lockdown at the end of this new lockdown period,” he said. The governor added that the extended lockdown came as a result of a public opinion poll which, according to him, had 53 per cent in support of the continuation, while 43 per cent wanted a review just as 4 per cent were undecided. He urged residents to be compliant with all the laid down rules and regulations, saying it should be seen as a moral responsibility and civic duty. (NAN)
