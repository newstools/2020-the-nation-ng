 RIVERS State government has withdrawn its charges against two pilots of Caverton Helicopters and 10 passengers arrested for violating Governor Nyesom Wike’s Executive Order on COVID-19. The arrest of the pilots on April 7, 2020, generated controversies and caused bad blood between the state and the Federal Government. The state government, despite the crisis, arraigned and remanded the pilots and their passengers, who were later granted conditional bails by the Chief Magistrates’ Court sitting in Port Harcourt, the state capital. In a statement yesterday in Port Harcourt, Information and Communication Commissioner Paulinus Nsirim said the government, through the Attorney-General, withdrew and discontinued prosecution of the two separate charges. Nsirim said: “The Rivers State government, through the Attorney-General, has withdrawn and discontinued the two separate charges preferred against the two pilots of Caverton Helicopters Limited and the 10 passengers on board before the Port Harcourt Chief Magistrates’ Court. “Consequently, the presiding Chief Magistrate, D. D. Ihua-Maduenyi, has struck out the two charges and discharged all the defendants.”
