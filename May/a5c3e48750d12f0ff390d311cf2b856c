The Acting Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Prof. Kemebradikumo Pondei, has described as incorrect and unfounded, reports that some senior Staff of the Commission were recently sacked. The Interim Management Committee in charge of the Commission has been accused of sacking some Senior NDDC Staff who may assist the Senate in the ongoing probe of the Committee over reported N40 billion scam. But briefing members of the Presidential Monitoring Committee on Niger Delta Development Commission, Pondei however stated that following the advice of the lead consultant in the ongoing forensic audit of the Commission, some members of Staff were placed on mandatory leave pending the outcome of the audit. Those affected, according to him, were already indicted bythe Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and their continued stay in office could interfere and undermine the forensic audit. He said: “Following the advice of the Lead Consultant on the Forensic Audit exercise, the Commission placed certain members of staff on mandatory leave with full benefits, pending the conclusion and outcome of the on-going forensic audit. Some of the affected staff were those already indicted by anti-corruption Agencies like the EFCC for acts of financial impropriety and corruption and whose continuous presence at their duty posts could interfere, impair, undermine or compromise the objective of the forensic audit exercise”. Meanwhile, the Presidential Monitoring Committee commended the President for the extension of the tenure of Interim Management Committee, adding that it will allow it superintend the satisfactory conclusion of the ongoing forensic audit of the Commission and “reposition NDDC to be able to deliver on its mandate effectively going forward”.
