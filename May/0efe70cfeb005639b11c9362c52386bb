LAGOS State Commissioner for Home Affairs Prince Anofiu Elegushi has applauded the Anwar-ul-Islam Movement of Nigeria for its gesture in flattening the curve of coronavirus. Elegushi enjoined other religious bodies to emulate the organisation. He spoke after receiving cash donation from the organisation in Alausa. According to him, the government welcomes assistance in its fight against COVID-19. Anwar-Islam National General Secretary Alhaji Hameed Ajani, who led the team to donate the cheque, hailed the government’s measures to contain the virus. “We appreciated the health care facilities put in place by the government in combating the pandemic,” he said. He said the need to support the state arose due to severity of the pandemic and its effect on the limited resources available. “This has pushed the organisation to step up and assist the government to fight the virus,” he added. Ajani praised the government for distributing thousands of stimulus packages to Lagosians, saying it was important for other organisations and religious bodies to complement efforts of the government. “Today, we have reached out to Lagos State government. The reality is that government cannot do it alone and that’s why we also joined several corporate organisations and individuals that had done similar things and l believe several others would still do likewise.”
