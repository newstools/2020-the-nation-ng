 A LIFE coach expert, Andy Oyemi, has said post COVID-19 concerns about mental and emotional well-being should be a top priority in Nigeria. The New York, United States-based expert in Life Coaching, said this is important as individuals, families and companies have already lost or may lose their incomes and livelihoods, with families dealing with deaths of loved ones in a manner that is traumatic, as a result of the pandemic. He said any economic recovery plan or business continuity programme that does not factor in mental health and emotional wellness will only be a cosmetic approach that will not deliver long term and sustainable value to individuals affected and the larger society, who have been devastated by the pandemic and the attendant effects of social distancing and movement restrictions.
