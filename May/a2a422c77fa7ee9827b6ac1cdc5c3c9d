The Adamawa chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has taken facemasks, rice and indomie to residents of the northern part of the state. The trip to Michika, Madagali, Mubi North and Mubi South as well as Hong, Gombi and Song local government areas was the continuation of a palliative distribution tour round the state, which began on Tuesday. Chairman of the party, Alhaji Ibrahim Bilal, said the palliatives were meant to reach over 50’000 households in 226 wards of the state’s 21 LGAs. ‘We are giving these palliatives to cushion the hardship caused by COVID-19 lockdown in the state,” the party chairman explained, urging APC chairmen in the 226 wards to ensure the palliatives get to the most vulnerable people across political divides,” he stated. He said the APC as a party had chosen to acquire and donate the palliative items in addition to what individual members and office holders under the party had donated as COVID-19 lockdown palliatives. Beneficiaries of the palliatives from the APC were particularly excited about the facemask, as it was a refreshing change from the food items usually given by individuals and organisations. Unlike food items that were taken away and shared to people at ward level, some of the facemasks were given to people who gathered at local government distribution centres. A recipient of a facemask in Mubi South, Abubakar Sadiq, said, “Mubi currently has quite a number of COVID-19 cases, but the people are still not yet sufficiently convinced on the need to wear facemask. Even some of us who came here, as you can see, don’t have facemask but have it now thanks to the coming of APC. They will wear it and others who don’t have will acquire it somehow. That way it will go round.”
