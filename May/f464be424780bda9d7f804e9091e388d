 Rasheed Yekini should not be compared with other African strikers, says former Real Madrid midfielder Mutiu Adepoju. The Super Eagles’ all-time leading scorer bowed out to legendary Egypt forward Hossam Hassan in the African Legends Cup of Nations’ first round. Notwithstanding Yekini winning three of the four categories, he failed to progress to the Round of 16 against Hassan who was dominant at club level where he was a serial and record-breaking winner in Egypt. His former international teammate, Adepoju who was also part of the 1994 Africa Cup of Nations squad insists the 1993 African Player of the Year winner is not below any African striker’s rank. “Yekini was a goal poacher who was born to score goals and he got them [the goals] at the very right time,” the La Liga ambassador told Goal. “Whenever he was in a good position, you will see him asking for the ball and he would complete the job using his speed and shot. “I remember in one of the 1994 World Cup qualifiers against Congo in Brazzaville, the game was a tension-soaked affair. “Despite getting there via a chartered flight, the atmosphere was very hostile but we were able to play our hearts out and Yekini got the only goal of the game through his effort. “It was a beautiful goal as his terrific shot caught the goalkeeper unawares.” “During his time, Yekini was a striker per excellence who never played second-fiddle to anyone in Africa. He was a striker in his own class. “It was always a nice feeling seeing him lead the frontline because the midfielders know that when he gets the ball, he would definitely get something out of it. “Although, he never played in the Champion League but I can say he was very good and I can say he is not inferior to any other great strikers produced.” (Goal.com)
