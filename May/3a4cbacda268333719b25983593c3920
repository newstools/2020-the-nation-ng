Manchester United have been linked with Moussa Dembele for a very long time and the latest reports seem positive for the Red Devils. According to Manchester Evening News, the French striker could leave Lyon in the summer transfer window and he would find it hard to reject a move to Old Trafford. Last year, The Daily Record revealed that the former Championship player is keen on joining the Red Devils. Not so long ago, Sky Sports’ Kaveh Solhekol also claimed that Dembele’s dream would be to play for Manchester United in the Champions League. It must be remembered that after the decision taken by Ligue 1 to end the campaign, Lyon have finished 7th in the table, which means they will not be taking part in any sort of European football (next term) for the first time since 1997. It must also be taken into consideration that United were 5th in the table when the season was suspended and if it is canceled, then the Red Devils will once again miss out on Champions League football. The latest update provided by the Premier League is that all the clubs want to complete the remaining fixtures.
