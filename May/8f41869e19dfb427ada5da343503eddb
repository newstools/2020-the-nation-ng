 FEDERAL Controller of Works in Lagos, Mr Kayode Popoola, on Thursday said Obalende Bridge linking Dodan Baracks in Lagos had been shut for rehabilitation. Popoola told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on phone that the road was seriously damaged by a petroleum tanker fire. ”We shut it  to avert danger,” he said. The controller said the inferno, which raged for over five hours, affected the structural integrity of the bridge. “Obalende Bridge got burnt last week Friday and we have shut it to prevent calamity. It was burnt by a tanker going to supply a petroleum product to a petrol station around that area, it spilled all its content on the road and caused a huge fire. “We have shut down the bridge to carry out integrity test on it before we can know the extent of damage,’’ he told NAN. He said that ministry officials as well as contractors had resumed work after the COVID-19 lockdown which made some companies suspend construction work.
