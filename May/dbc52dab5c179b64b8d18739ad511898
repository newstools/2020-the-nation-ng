 Former Super Eagles winger, Emmanuel Amuneke has tasked the manager of the senior national team, Gernot Rohr to find a way to accommodate some young players in Europe who are doing very well for their respective clubs. Amuneke specifically listed Heerenveen of Holland left winger, Chidera Ejuke and Mainz 05 Striker, Taiwo Awoniyi among others whom he claimed are doing well in Europe and deserve to be given opportunities in the team. The 1994 African Footballer of the Year who is the Academy Supervisor of Misr Lel Makkasa of Egypt noted that he scouted Ejuke for the Golden Eaglets team that won the FIFA U-17 World Cup in 2015. “When I first saw Chidera Ejuke, it was in Kaduna when I was going round Nigeria to scout for players to make up the U-17 for 2015 edition,” Amuneke told NationSport.  “Chidera is a very good player technically. As a young boy, you could see the technicality in him as a player but of course there are other aspects that must be improved but unfortunately he was not able to make my team due to one reason or the other which I don’t want to go into details. “He is a very talented player. When you see him with the ball, his decision making and domination with the ball, show his quality. Of course we shouldn’t be carried away and forget that in 2015 most of these players were playing on the streets. Actually they do not possess the ability to be at the top level but of course you can see the promises in them. On Awoniyi, he said: “Every player deserves a chance. When you have these kind of players now, what you need to do is to expose them. Taiwo Awoniyi of the set of the Golden Eaglets class of 2013 is doing well also. He has done well to maintain the consistency.”
