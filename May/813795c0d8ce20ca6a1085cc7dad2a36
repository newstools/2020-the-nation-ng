EbonyLife media boss, Mo Abudu, has announced that her firm will be embarking on a face mask sharing spree for the next two weeks. Abudu made the announcement on Monday, May 11, via her social media accounts. The showbiz impresario noted that she’s excited to be giving away face masks for free through the EbonyLife face mask bank. She also noted that this is in line with the state government’s enforcement of face mask-wearing following the relaxed lockdown in the state. “Good morning beautiful people. The EbonyLife face mask bank is excited to be giving away face masks for free over the next two weeks. We kick off our roadshow today! Our distribution points will be at Spar Supermarkets in 5 locations all over Lagos to include: Ilupeju, Surulere, Opebi, Victoria Island, and Lekki. So come along today and collect a free face mask at Spar Supermarket Ilupeju between 11:00 am to 1:00 pm. Over the weekend, The Executive Governor of Lagos State, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, stated that “the wearing of a face mask in public is not a suggestion, it is a necessity and mandatory.” Please feel free to pick up a FREE face mask from our Face Mask Bank. Wearing a face mask in public spaces will keep you safe and all those around you. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Artee Industries Limited, the owners of Spar for letting us distribute our masks through their outlets,” she wrote.
