THE former Deputy Governor of Lagos State, Dr Idiat Oluranti Adebule, has urged Muslims to use the Ramadan period to pray and work towards a solution to the pandemic Coronavirus ravaging the world. Adebule said this in a message to felicitate with the Muslim world on the commencement of the month long fasting. According to her, Ramadan is a period during which God accepts prayers and also a time for spiritual reflection, increased devotion and worship. She said the commencement of Ramadan provided a unique opportunity for Muslims to support the global effort to end the Covid-19 pandemic with fervent prayers to Allah for mercy. She particularly called on all Muslims to see the occurrence of the Coronavirus pandemic and its momentary global impact as a warning from Allah that “we humans need Him for our existence and sustenance and that our human might and power cannot withstand the weakest of His trials.” She, however, hailed the frontline workers for their dedication and bravery in putting their lives on the line for others to live. She prayed to Allah to protect them and their families. She also commended the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 for their daily briefings and efforts in the management of the pandemic. The PTF briefings, she said, have kept Nigerians and the international community up-to-date on the actions of the government in mitigating the impact of this global health challenge in Nigeria. The former Lagos Deputy Governor hailed Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and his team for being proactive and decisive in containing the dreaded virus. She praised the governor for boosting the morale of the health workers by increasing their allowances. She urged Lagosians to support the governor with prayers and adhere strictly to the government’s instructions on how to manage the COVID-19 scourge.
