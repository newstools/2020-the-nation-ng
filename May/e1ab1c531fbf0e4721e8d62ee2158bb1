 The Divisional Police Officer (DPO) of Okada and some of his men are facing disciplinary action for assaulting and detaining a member of staff of Igbinedion University Health Care Centre, Okada, Dr. Clinton Osayande. The State Police command on Friday apologised to the medical doctor and Edo branch of the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) while wishing that the ‘unfortunate and avoidable’ incident never happened. Edo Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Chidi Nwabuzor, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), said in Benin: “It was reported that on the 21st May, 2020, the DPO, while conducting stop and search duty with his men, near the police station in Okada, intercepted Dr. Clinton Osayande, who was driving his car. “A harsh argument ensued when the police officers asked Dr. Osayande to pull over. “When it became extremely difficult for him to pull over, the officers shot at his vehicle’s tyre, assaulted him and later detained him for a night. “Edo police command strongly condemns the act of incivility against Dr. Osayande and tenders unreserved apology to him and the NMA, Edo State branch.” Nwabuzor added the disciplinary measures against the errant officers and men would serve as a deterrent to others.
