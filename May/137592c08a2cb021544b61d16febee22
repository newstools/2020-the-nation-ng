 Peace may be returning to Ondo State All Progressives Congress (APC) following the withdrawal of the suit challenging the authentic chairman, Ade Adetimehin. Erstwhile factional chairman Idodu Otetubi has withdrawn the suit No. FHC /AK/CS/10/2019 at the High Court, Akure, the state capital, pledging his loyalty to the state executive committee led by Adetimehin, an engineer. However, the chapter is still battling with three main crises. These are the ruptured relationship between Governor Rotimi Akeredolu (SAN) and his deputy, Agboola Ajayi, the controversy over an undisclosed account and the onslaught of the divided and rancorous Unity Forum against the governor as the chapter prepares for primary. Adetimehin is said to be working hard to ensure a cohesive party ahead of the shadow poll. He has the backing of the Southwest leader, Pastor Bankole Oluwajana, who is greatly concerned about the disunity in the chapter. Lauding Otetubi for his reconciliatory moves, Oluwajana said the patriotic decision and step will unite the party, adding that the display of loyalty and commitment will not go unnoticed. In a statement by the zonal publicity secretary, Karounwi Oladapo, the zonal leader urged other aggrieved chieftains to jettison personal interests for collective aspirations. Oluwajana said:”The Party further reiterates that APC places high premium on elevating the collective interests of the Party above individual interests. “Similar factions in APC wherever they exist in other states of the South West were advised to follow the good example of Hon Idowu Otetubi in the overall interest of the party.” He added:”There are consequences for good behavior as well as bad behavior. The party commends Otetubi’s action and advice other members of APC who have axe to grind with the Party in Ondo State to follow suit and reconcile themselves in the overall interest of the party. “
