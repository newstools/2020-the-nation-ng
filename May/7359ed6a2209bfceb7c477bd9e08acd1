 INSTAGRAM sensation, Animashaun Samuel Perry, better known by his moniker, Broda Shaggi has listed four principles to guide emerging social media comedians (Instagram comedians) who wish to be famous in no time. The UNILAG graduate revealed these principles during an Instagram live chat with Art lecturer and Author Dr. Bolaji Ogunwo. He listed the first principle as ‘Getting a brand’, he said “Get a brand, something you know you want to stick to no matter how small. Create a youtube channel, very important, Instagram won’t pay you for your content, the only way you make money from Instagram is by advertising for brands, post on your page as adverts, that is the only way you can make money, but youtube your video is there forever you keep making money from every view. The second principle is ‘consistency’, he said procrastination kills brand “You have to be consistent, whatever brand you’ve created, it will get to a point when you’ll be like I’m tired I’ll give them skit tomorrow, it kills brand, it kills your personal moral,” said Broda Shaggi. The third is ‘personal character.’ He said, “Personal character goes a long way, you have to be loved by people, if you want to grow your followers, people must love you which means you have to keep in touch, they have to know about you. There is a part of my life where I don’t put on social media, so you must not put everything all on social media, but the little you can show to let your fans know about you. Aside from my post, I do live videos and post on my story to let my fans know I’m going out”. The last principle is ‘God’, “Never joke with God” said Bro Shaggi. The self-acclaimed ‘Fine boy agbero’ Broda Shaggi, remains one of the most successful Instagram comedians with over 4.3 million followers on Instagram and 463,000 subscribers on youtube.
