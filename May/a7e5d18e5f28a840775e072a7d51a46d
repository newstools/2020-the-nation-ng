A 13 year-old girl has reportedly committed suicide in Warri, Delta state over beatings she received for engaging in sexual affairs. It was gathered the incident occurred on Saturday behind a Total Filling Station near Warri Main Garage in the oil- city. Residents of the area, while expressing anger over the development, said she was a familiar face in the area. According to them, the late teen lived with an elder sister, who is also unidentified and had beaten her for having a boyfriend. Annoyed by the sister’s action, the deceased took an insecticide and ended up dead behind the fuel station. A source said: “It’s a shame. The girl was seen by her elder sister with a man and she beat her for having a male lover at her age. She went inside and killed herself by drinking Angle 90 (insecticide). “She’s too small to have a man lover. Don’t look at her body, she is a small girl. They should throwaway her body, no need to bury her. “Residents of the area are angry because we all know her as a little girl, we don’t know her name but we use to see her around.” The Delta State Police Command could not confirm the incident when contacted on Monday. It’s Public Relations Officer, DSP Onome Onovwakpoyeya said: “The one that happened was that of two weeks ago. This one is a different one. May be the matter was not reported to the police”.
