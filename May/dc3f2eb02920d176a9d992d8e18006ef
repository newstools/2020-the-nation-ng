The Chief Ralph Uwazuruike-led Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra, MASSOB, other wise called Biafra Independent Movement, BIM has allayed fears of crises in Onitsha, Nnewi and environs in Anambra state following the commemoration of its 21st anniversary of new Biafra. Palpable fear reportedly gripped residents of the area as some had gone to the market to make last minute purchases ahead of the event in view of previous celebrations marked every May 22, 2020. Addressing newsmen on Thursday in Onitsha, the MASSOB-BIM Regional Administrator for Idemili North local government Area, Mr James Ezeani, dismissed possible attack, revealing that the event would be low-key. He said, “Due to the COVID-19 pandemic now killing people globally, we will not be on procession, we will stay in our various domains and make merry, thank God for giving us a sovereign state of Biafra which we had been praying for. “Currently we have been admitted as the 46th member nation among the Unrepresented Nations On People’s Organization, UNPO and I commend Chief Ralph Uwazuuike, Ezeigbo Gburugburu, for his efforts towards achieving a Biafra state and also towards our admittance as 46th member Nation of UNPO” “I salute the new Biafran President, His Excellency, Solomon Chukwu who has continued from where Chief Uwazuruike, now father of the Biafran nation stopped. “There will not be any sort of harassment of people on that day as we are a non violent movement struggling for a Biafran state but I urge Biafrans to join us in the celebration. “I commend elders, directors and Areas who work with me and Chief Prime Minister, Chief Lambert Obikizu and Chief Vincent Iloh, the Chief Judge and Emma Omenka, the Agric and Works Minister and larry Odinma, planning and strategy.”
