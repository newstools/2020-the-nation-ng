 THE Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi (Ojaja II), has donated two motorised modular fumigators each to the Edo and Delta State governments to enable the government fight the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The Elejesi of Ife land, Oba Babatunde Awosunle, who led other members of Ooni COVID-19 team to the Government House in Benin, announced the donation. Speaking on behalf of the members of the team, the Director of Media and Public Affairs in the palace, Moses Olafare, stated that the Ooni deemed it fit to complement Governor Godwin Obaseki’s brilliant response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Olafare said: “This is why we decided to donate two Motorised Modular Fumigators (MMFs) to the state. We invented and fabricated the machines at the palace of the Ooni of Ife to complement the efforts of state governments in collectively fighting against the deadly disease.” The director stressed that the Ife monarch was ready to collaborate with Edo government on campaigns to fumigate different flashpoints in the state. He said the gesture would be supported by drone service. Olafare said: “We have finished the distribution within the Southwest part of the country. We are starting the second phase of the exercise, which is the Southsouth. This is what we have started in Edo State and we know the relationship between Edo and Ile- Ife, which is why we are here.”
