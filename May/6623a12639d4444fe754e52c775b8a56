 THE National Association of Nigerian Professional Footballers (NANPF) has disagreed with the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) over application of FIFA’s $500,000 about (N180m) fund. Players’ Union general secretary Austin Popo said part of the fund, contrary to the assessment of NFF president Amaju Pinnick, should be distributed as palliatives to support Nigerian clubs and players in the Covid-19 pandemic. Pinnick had explained in a lengthy twitter tread that the operational fund from football’s governing body for 2019 and 2020 is neither a relief fund nor palliative. Popo explained: “When we got wind of the fund coming we contacted FIPRO and they sent information to us that FIFA is releasing the fund early to assist federations in this trying time. We wrote to NFF and advice on the need to make palliatives available to clubs and players. We feel this is the right thing to do.” He noted that the Union is still speaking with the NFF to ensure that the leadership of the NFF creates palliatives from the fund. “It depends on the leadership because the whole world can see what the Sport minister is doing in the area of palliatives for athletes.  Nigerian clubs are struggling and players suffering, this is the time to help them as it is done in other climes,” Popo added. According to information received from FIFA, the $500,000 is from the $1,000,000 yearly provision for affiliated federations as operational cost. “Out of amount, 500,000USD is allotted to run the federation and 500,000USD is allotted to organize competition. Out of the 500,000USD allotted, each competition is categorized and allotted for 50,000USD for 10 activities,” the FIFA document reads in part. FIFA is allotting an additional 2,000,000USD for four-year cycle (2019-2022) for development project particularly football infrastructure such as pitches, technical center, training grounds, stadium, and headquarters development. It will be recalled that Sport Minister Sunday Dare had floated a relief fund for athletes whose source of income have ceased because of the coronavirus, following the suspension of sporting activities in the world and fewer than 200 athletes have benefited from the first batch of palliatives.
