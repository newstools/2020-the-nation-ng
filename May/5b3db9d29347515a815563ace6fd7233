A former Vice Chancellor of the University of Benin, Professor Friday Orumwense has commended Federal Government efforts to halt the spread of coronavirus pandemic. The don made the statement in Benin City in an interview with The Nation. Orumwese said steps taken so far by the Federal Government and the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) in tackling the pandemic have gone a long way in reducing the number of infected cases to the barest minimum. The author and Professor of Mechanical Engineering also advised Nigerians to stay safe by obeying instructions and guidelines by the government and healthcare providers. According to him: “This issue is not a national issue but global one which national government can only try its efforts to make sure citizens are protected, without people there is no government and there should be a mutual understanding. “Nigerians should understand that whatsoever information given to them is for them stay at home, wash your hands always, use nose mask even if you must go out and leave the remaining one for the government,” he stated. He also urged Nigerians to keep praying for our leaders, especially during the Holy month of Ramadan. “This is not the time to blame government or nag over any issue, please let’s pray for the nation and our leaders to be able to do more, it’s not easy to run government, citizens cooperation is needed, let’s cooperate with our government.”
