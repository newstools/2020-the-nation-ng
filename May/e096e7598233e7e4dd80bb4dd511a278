Lagos state chapter of Association of Professional Footballers of Nigeria (APFON) have threatened to drag the Lagos State Football Association (LSFA) over its statutes. The players union is calling for a redress of the statutes to accommodate players representatives. Speaking in Lagos, president of Lagos APFON Tajudeen Disu said it is an aberration for the FA statutes not to have players’ representatives. As a major stakeholder in football, players union are contesting the fact that while the statutes of NFF, Article 28 Section 1 (d) specifies that the players’ association which is subordinate to the NFF shall present three delegates for the Elective Congress, the 2010 Statutes of LSFA, which is still in use in its Article 26 on delegates and votes made no provision for the players’ association. “I’ve not seen anything like this. All over the world I’ve not seen an FA without players’ representatives as part of its board. When we saw this anomaly, we have written repeatedly to the NFF and the Lagos FA without any response. As it is we have no choice than to head to court. “During the last elections in Lagos, they kept players out and we are not going to allow that to happen again. We have written to the NFF and Lagos FA but they have not replied us. They treat us like threat to the game and this is unfortunate,” the former Flying Eagles and Abiola Babes defender added.
