There is no COVID-19 case in any of the 244 correctional facilities across the country, Minister of Interior Rauf Aregbesola said on Thursday. Speaking at the Presidential Taskforce on COVID-19 media briefing in Abuja, Aregbesola said the Federal Government had also decongested the correctional centres with the recent pardon granted to some prisoners by President Muhammadu Buhari. He attributed the absence of Coronavirus case to diligence of officers. The minister said the combined taskforce of security agencies were on patrol of Nigeria and Cameron borders to forestall the coming of both legal and illegal people into the country. He also commended the governors of Borno, Taraba, Cross Rivers, Benue, among others, for ensuring the prevention of people who could compromise the country’s border. “The effort we are making as PTF is to ensure that even after this COVID-19, we will look at how we have changed our attitude and a new social economic and spiritual order will emerge,” Aregbesola said.
