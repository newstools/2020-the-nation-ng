Rev TB Joshua of the Synagogue Church of All Nations has enjoined Nigerians to be ready for life after the Covid-19 pandemic. According to him, “If you don’t get your job back or you don’t get a proper job or a full-time job or you run into loss or lose a loved one after this lockdown, don’t despair; don’t doubt your God, who is about to establish you.” He observed that setback and disappointment come and only those who can endure last. He enjoined that survive the current time, Nigerians must be “ready to start little, cut your coat according to your cloth and endure temporary pain. You know what I mean – the type of life you live must be in accordance with little. It may cause you to withdraw from the city to a rural life or to do away with some of your properties.’ According to him, what is happening now was not strange as it happens from time to time and that only those who can overcome will tell the story later.
