The Lagos Lawn Tennis Club has donated the sum of N5milllion to the Lagos State government towards the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. Presenting the cheque to Kola Peregrino in Ikeja, GM, Lagos State Printing Corporation, who stood in for the Lagos State government, president of the club, Ademola Akin-Taylor said the cheque was the club’s widow’s mite towards state’s battle against the rampaging Covid-19. “We are very impressed with Lagos State and the governor, who is one of our patrons; so automatically, we have to support him in his fight against the virus,” Akin-Taylor said. He added that the club considered the gesture more pertinent because the state, as its host, has always supported it, especially by staging its annual Governor’s Cup tennis tournament in its facility. A member of the club’s Covid-19 fundraising committee, Gboyega Marinho commended members for their generosity: “It was a wonderful job by all members of the club, who contributed from N5000, to N10,000, to N200,000 to N1million to ensure that the sum of N5million was realized.” Speaking on behalf of the state government, Peregrino, who is also Vice President of club, thanked members of the club for the gesture. He enjoined other clubs and societies to emulate what the Lagos Lawn Tennis Club has done and support the government in whatever capacity they can to ensure that the Covid-19 pandemic is finally contained and eradicated in Lagos and the entire country.
