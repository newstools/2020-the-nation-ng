  The FA Cup Final has been pencilled in for Saturday, August 8, though a midweek date of August 5 is also under consideration, but it is still expected to be the final game of the season as part of the Premier League’s Project Restart. The Premier League is mindful of the FA’s acute financial situation, with the cancellation of Euro 2020 and all summer events at Wembley, which make finishing the FA Cup this season crucial if the governing body is to stem some of its huge financial losses due to the coronavirus shutdown. FA chief executive Mark Bullingham has already said that the national governing body will lose more than £100million due to coronavirus and cutbacks could be made to grass roots programmes. The FA will act in concert with the Premier League and only start competitions if the Government deem it safe with more talks expected with the deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam this week. The Premier League required flexibility from the national federations and UEFA to cancel Euro 2020 to allow the possibility of finishing domestic leagues.
