Nigerian rapper, Naetochukwu Chikwe aka Naeto C has given reasons for retiring from music after a sterling career that spanned over a decade. In a heartily banter with colleague and friend, MI Abaga, on Instagram Live, the 10/10 rapper said he has neither been musically motivated nor challenged to wan to return to music actively. “I mean of course the world is not the same without Naeto C. So my thing is that I love music and I just want to feel motivated and feel like there’s a challenge that I want to embark on because for a long time there hasn’t been like a challenge, that kind of motivation,” he opened up. “I really love music but people have to remember that human beings are human beings, we can only be human beings. So it’s not like I’m just one robot that has been programmed to make music. I have to be motivated and inspired.” Unknown to many of their fans, Naeto C and M.I have been best of friends after they met Nigeria’s capital city, Abuja many years back. Naeto says, “We [MI and I] go way back. You’re a special guy – the kind that needs to be protected. I’m not as active as I used to be, but I know what’s going on. When you hit me up to know what the situation is, we’re not looking for clout. I’ve known you for an extremely long time. You have walked so other people can fly. For me, I felt I had to ride for you.” The rapper also revealed that Wande Coal’s stage name was originally Ebony. He added that he featured him first before he sang his hit single, ‘Ololufe’ under Mohits. Naeto C won MTV music awards 2008-Best New Musician, 2009 Channel O music video awards- video of the year and MTV Africa Music Awards 2009-Best New Artist and he was ranked among the richest and most influential artists in Nigeria.
