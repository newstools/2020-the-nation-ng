Kano State Governor Dr Abdullahi Ganduje has announced the donation of a 400 capacity Mobile testing centre by Aliko Dangote to the state. Dr Abdullahi Ganduje hinted this at a media briefing held at the Government House on Saturday. A statement issued by Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Abba Anwar, said the Mobile Testing Centre has a daily 400 testing capacity. He explained that “As we are targeting more Testing Centres in the state, the richest man in Africa, Alhaji Aliko Dangote is donating Mobile Testing Centre with the capacity of testing 400 people daily. The facility is coming to Kano in the next two days, by Monday.” The Nation reports that Aliko Dangote had earlier donated a 500-bed isolation centre to Kano State situated at Sani Abacha stadium in the metropolis. Ganduje noted that, with the rising cases of positive COVID-19 patients,  “ it is a thing of great concern. Though we are aware that with the reopening of the Aminu Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital Testing Centre with the capacity of 88 samples per day, and the coming up of another Testing Centre at Bayero University, Kano, with the capacity of 20 samples per day, would mean another rise in the identified positive cases.”
