Mrs Ngozi Ozioko, Chairman of Nsukka Main Market Traders Association, has threatened to recommend 14 days isolation for any foodstuff seller who fails to maintain social distancing and wearing of face mask. Ozioko gave the warning in Nsukka while addressing foodstuff traders at different locations in the market. She said that the market security guards had been directed to arrest culprits and hand them over to appropriate government officials for isolation. The market leader said the warning became necessary as the COVID-19 Taskforce in Enugu State had vowed to seal completely any market in the state that fails to comply with directives on social distancing and wearing of face mask. “Any market that the taskforce seals, there will be no selling of foodstuff, vegetables and fruits to the people. “It’s left for you to maintain social distancing, put on your face mask or risk 14 days in COVID-19 Nsukka isolation centre. “These measures of washing of hands regularly, maintaining of social distancing and wearing of face mask are meant to protect us from contracting COVID-19, as well as control the spread of the deadly virus that have killed thousands of people across the world,” she said. She also directed them not to sell any food stuff to buyers without face masks as such people are sabotaging government’s effort toward curbing the spread of coronavirus in the country. On reopening of the entire market, the chairman said that it was only the Enugu State Government that had authority to decide when markets in the state would be reopened. “Government is not happy that markets are closed, but it’s one of the ways to control the spreading of coronavirus pandemic. “What we should know is that, it is only when one is alive that he or she will continue to transact business in the market,” Ozioko said.
