 EXACTLY a year since he last scored for his former club in the Belgian League, Royal Excel Mouscron, Taiwo Awoniyi returned to scoring ways on Sunday when he scored his first goal of the season for Mainz 05 in the German Bundesliga when he notched one in their 2-2 away draw with FC Koln. Awoniyi has found limited game time at Mainz and has only been sparingly used by the German league side playing only seven games from the 26 matches. The Nigerian International has only started a league game (versus Fortuna Dusseldorf on October 19 2019) out of the seven with his last game coming in his team’s 2-1 loss to Augsburg on December 7 2019 before yesterday tie with FC Koln. Awoniyi who was a 56th minute replacement for Dong Won Ji came on when Mainz were 2-0 down to Koln through goals from Mark Hector and Florian Kainz in the sixth minute (penalty kick) and 53rd minute. The Nigerian attacker started his team great comeback almost immediately. He reduced the deficit in the 61st minute through a close range finish after a good cross from the right wing by Bote Baku and Pierre Kunde completed the comeback with the equaliser in the 72nd minute. The Liverpool on loan star thus broke his goal drought dated May 17 2019 when he fired a double for Royal Excel Mouscron in their 4-2 home loss to Waasland Beveren. Awoniyi’s Mainz 05 are now 15th with 27 points from 26 games and they will next play third placed RB Leipzig at home on Sunday.
