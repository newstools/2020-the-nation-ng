 Two persons were on Saturday crushed to death and another injured at Sango, Ogun State, when a truck had a head-on collision with another truck. The accident, which occurred at the Sango Tollgate corridor of the Lagos -Abeokuta expressway, involved a containerised truck marked AAA448XJ, Dangote truck marked GN 7248-16 and a tanker with registration number KSF991XF. It was learnt that the containerised truck had a brake failure and in the diver’s attempts to avoid crashing into vehicles on its track, it veered into the lane of outbound Lagos traffic, colliding head-on with a Dangote truck and one other in the process. The Public Relations Officer of the Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps (TRACE), Babatunde Akinbiyi, who confirmed the accident, said the injured was rescued to the Ota State Hospital while the remains of the dead were taken to Ifo Mortuary – all in Ogun State.
