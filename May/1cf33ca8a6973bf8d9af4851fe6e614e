President Donald Trump on Friday severed the United States’ relationship with the World Health Organization (WHO) because, as he said, China had “total control” over the organization. Beijing, Trump also claimed, pressured the body to “mislead the world” about the COVID-19 pandemic. Trump also said the U.S. would be revoking Hong Kong’s special trade and customs treatment and would be suspending the entry of Chinese citizens who were identified as “potential security risks.” The president did not detail what those “potential security risks” were or how they would be determined, and reporters did not have the opportunity to ask for clarification given that Trump left the podium abruptly after his statement. Thereafter, he left the scheduled press conference without answering any questions. Trump’s announcement – and subsequent departure from the White House’s Rose Garden – comes two days after the U.S. surpassed 100,000 COVID-19 deaths and a day after he tweeted about “shooting” protesters in Minneapolis, writing, “When the looting starts, the shooting starts.”
