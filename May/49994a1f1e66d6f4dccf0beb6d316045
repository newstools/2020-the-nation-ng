The Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) has decried poor health facilities in the Niger Delta region saying the deplorable situation was a major constraint in the fight against the Coronavirus pandemic. The Acting Managing Director of the commission, Prof. Kemebradikumo Pondei, also observed that the ongoing anti-Coronavirus measures, including lockdowns of states contributed in dwindling the economy of the region. Pondei spoke at the weekend in a brief ceremony organised by the NDDC to begin distribution of medical supplies and relief materials to states in the region to contain the spread of the virus. It was gathered that the equipment and materials, including public enlightenment campaigns, were acquired and initiated by the commission as part of its intervention to fight the pandemic in the region. A statement signed by the Commission’s Director, Corporate Affairs, Charles Odili, said the ceremony was held at the NDDC Warehouse, in Trans-Amadi Industrial Layout, Port Harcourt. Pondei said the NDDC needed to complement the efforts of the nine states covered by its mandate in response to the directive of President Muhammadu Buhari. “All the nine NDDC states were supported with funds. In addition, funds were also given to women and youth groups as palliatives”, he said. He said that the funds given to the states were utilized for the procurement of medical equipment such as special diagnostic equipment, critical care equipment, including ventilators and consumables, adding that others were various food items, beverages, sanitary materials and disinfectants. In his remarks, the NDDC Executive Director, Projects, Dr. Cairo Ojougbo, said that covid-19 was the most important issue in the world, noting that the commission came up with programmes to curb the spread of the virus.
