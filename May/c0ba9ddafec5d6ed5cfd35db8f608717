The Police in Lagos on Wednesday arrested a dismissed soldier identified as Okoliko Andrew and one Idowu Adebayo for allegedly smuggling 1,200kgs of Marijuana. The suspects were intercepted around Itowolo in Ikorodu for plying the Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) corridor by men of the Lagos State Taskforce. They were said to have driven two loaded vehicles with illicit drugs on the prohibited BRT lanes and when intercepted, presented themselves as serving military personnel. Not convinced by their defence, policemen attached to the Taskforce were said to have searched the vehicles where the hard substances were allegedly found. According to a witness, the policemen became suspicious when the suspects could not properly identify themselves. It was gathered that 25 bags of 50kg Marijuana were recovered from the suspects. They were said to have confessed that they were offered N50,000 to deliver the Marijuana to someone at Sura Market, Lagos Island. The Nation reports that so many fake and dismissed military personnel have been arrested since the commencement of the COVID-19 occasioned lockdown in Lagos by both the Nigerian Army and the police. Most of the arrested impersonators were caught dressed in military uniform either flouting lockdown orders, escorting contraband or extorting unsuspecting civilians. Confirming the arrest, spokesman Bala Elkana said: “The suspects are in our custody, the vehicle and exhibits are also recovered. We have commenced investigation into the case. Not sure whether they are impersonators, fake or dismissed soldiers as reported but investigation will reveal please.”
