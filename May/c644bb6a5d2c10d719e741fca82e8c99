 AN 82-year-old widow who is also suffering from hypertension has recovered from the coronavirus disease after receiving nine-day treatment at the Isolation and Treatment Centre, Asubiaro, Osogbo, in Osun State. She was confirmed positive and admitted at the state isolation centre on the 13th of May, 2020. The state’s Commissioner for Health, Dr. Rafiu Isamotu, who disclosed this in a statement released in Osogbo yesterday, said the octogenarian’s recovery from the virus beats the odds as elderly people with chronic diseases are the highest risk group because most of the time, they are unable to recover from COVID-19. He noted that the patient, who contracted the disease after coming in contact with an infected person, showed no symptoms of the virus before her sample was collected, except for diarrhoea. Isamotu said: “The story of the 82-year-old widow who recovered from the dreaded coronavirus provides a glimmer of hope, considering that she is a hypertensive patient on medication. “Although when she arrived at our isolation centre on the 13th of May, she had no cough, difficulty in breathing, sore throat, fever or anosmia associated with the virus except for diarrhea, and we successfully treated her for it and she was stable all through the period of hospitalisation. “On her 9th day on admission, we carried out a follow-up Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test on her and the result came back negative. She was subsequently discharged on the 24th of May, 2020. “Furthermore, a follow-up at her home after she was discharged revealed that she was stable,” the commissioner added.
