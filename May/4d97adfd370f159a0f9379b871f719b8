President Muhammadu Buhari, on Tuesday, requested the Senate to confirm Professor Jumai Audi, for appointment as the Chairman of the Nigerian Law Reform Commission. Buhari in a letter read by Senate President Ahmad Lawan at plenary also sought the clearance of Hon. Ebele Bernard Chima, (Commissioner, South East), Barr. Bassey Dan Abia Commissioner, South-South) and Hon. Mohammed Ibraheem, (Commissioner, South-West) in the agency. Buhari’s letter reads in part: “In compliance with the provision of section 2(2) of the Nigerian Law Reform Commission Act No. 7 of 1999, I write to forward to the Senate for confirmation the under-listed (4) names of nominees as Chairman and full-time members of the Nigerian Law Reform Commission.” In a related development, the upper chamber also received a request from President Buhari for the confirmation the appointments of Diana Okonta (South-South) and Ya’ana Talib Yaro (North-East) as Non-Executive Directors of the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC). According to the President, the appointments of the nominees were done “in compliance with the provision of section 5(2)(4) of the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation Act” to fill existing vacancies. The Senate Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi, moved a motion, relying on order 1(b) of the Senate standing rules for the upper chamber to expedite action on the President’s request for the confirmation of the NDIC’s nominees. The Senate President, Lawan, in his ruling, underscored the need for the upper chamber to “fast-track the process” to enable committees to screen the nominees. Senator Lawan, thereafter, referred the request to the Senate Committee on Banking, Insurance, and Other Financial Institutions, chaired by Senator Uba Sani (Kaduna Central) for further legislative work. The Committee was given two weeks to report back to the upper chamber.
