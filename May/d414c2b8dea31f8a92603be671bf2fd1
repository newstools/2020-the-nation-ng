Nigeria- born FC Augsburg winger Noah Bazee was on target less than 20 minutes after stepping in as late substitute against Schalke 04 on Sunday. The 23- year- old was thrown into the match in the 59th minute as replacement for Swiss import Ruben Vargas. Bazee, who is eligible to play for Nigeria, grabbed his first goal for the club in the 76th minute to double the lead for Augsburg who had shot into the lead through homeboy Eduard Löwen. The icing on the cake and third goal for the visitors came from Venezuelan Sergio Duvan in the first minute of added time. Bazee, who has not played for Germany at any level, is born to a Nigerian father and a German mother.
While Bazee sang victor song Sunday, former Nigeria U-23 ace Taiwo Awoniyi was a late substitute as his club Manz05 were hammered 5-0 by visiting RB Leipzig. Awoniyi was in action for 29 minutes after replacing Dutch player Jean-Paul Boëtius. On Saturday Super Eagles left back Jamilu Collins was in action for 90 minutes as Paderborn and Hoffenheim settled for a 1-1 draw. Although all matches are being played behind closed doors as the Bundesliga became the first league to re-start after the massive suspension of sports activities by the coronavirus pandemic, introduction of unique cardboard supporters appear to have added some garnishing to the Bundesliga. In the tie between Borussia Monchengladbach and Bayer Leverkusen, which ended 3-1 in favour of Leverkusen about 13,000 fans had their faces carved in cardboard and stationed in the stadium to provide special effect as social distancing continues. There are strong indications that other leagues will hit the ground running early next month with strong emphasis on social distancing and keeping the fans away for now.
