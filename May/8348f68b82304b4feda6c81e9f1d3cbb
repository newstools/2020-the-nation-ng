Coronavirus deaths in Nigeria have risen to 200. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) made this known on Wednesday via its Twitter handle. Nigeria on Wednesday night, recorded 284 new cases of COVID-19 with the total number of discharged patients as 1840. Meanwhile, few days ago, the Federal Government expressed worries that there might have been a rise in the number of deaths not associated with coronavirus (COVID-19) since the outbreak of the disease in the country. Many of the deaths, it said, could be attributable to the phobia some Nigerians have developed for hospitals where they are supposed to receive qualitative care for fear that they might be diagnosed with COVID-19.
