Controversial popular musician Afeez Fashola aka Naira Marley has listed four reasons why people will be subjected to eternal damnation in hell. He said observing Ramadan alone was not enough to avoid going to hell. Those who fast, according to him, must avoid some habits that easily predispose them to damnation. The ‘Tesumole’ crooner on his verified official Twitter handle on Sunday listed some of the habits as  ‘not feeding the poor, lying, backbiting and speaking without knowledge.” He tweeted: “Four reasons for entering hell fire: 1.  Not offering Salah;  2. Not feeding the poor; 3 Idle talk, backbiting, lying, speaking without knowledge and Denying the day of resurrection” He added: “Stop asking me if I’m fasting. Because it says, if you are sick, pregnant and have problems with your head or mad, those people shouldn’t fast and I don’t fall into that category. “And to all of you that keep sending bum, stop sending to me now. When I wasn’t fasting you weren’t sending me any nudes, stop sending me bum now.”
