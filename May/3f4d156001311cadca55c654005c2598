Oil workers are responsible for 60 per cent of COVID-19 cases recorded in Rivers State, Governor Nyesom Wike, claimed on Wednesday. Blamed the rising COVID-19 cases in the state on unscreened oil workers, the governor noted that 60 per cent of infections in the state came from such employees returning from rigs. As at the time of filing this report, Rivers had 53 positive Coronavirus cases out of which 29 were active and 21 discharged. Three deaths were recorded. Speaking with the management team of Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited at Government House, Port Harcourt, the governor said the development was the reason he insisted that oil workers coming into the state must be tested to know their Coronavirus status. The governor said oil remained the mainstay of the economy and clarified that all his actions were not targeted at anybody or organisation. He recalled that recently the Nigeria Airforce Base, Port Harcourt quarantined 14 oil workers out which three of them tested positive for the virus. He said: “It’s not in anybody’s interest to deny people to carry out their official duties.  Oil is the main stay of the economy of Nigeria and without it, we that is in this part of the country will find it difficult to function. “My concern is that companies should always notify government of workers they are bringing into the state, so that our health officials can monitor them. Tthe Executive Director of the firm, Mr. Udobong Ntia, commended the governor for measures put in place to contain the spread of COVID 19 in the state, particularly the increase in testing.
