Fast-rising musician Oluwaseun Olorunmojo aka Seuncee is set to drop a new Extended Play (EP) titled The Lion Attitude.

According to Seuncee, the EP contains 4 tracks including ‘Don’t Lose,’ ‘Orente’ Ft CDQ and Fioke, ‘Fly’, and ‘Jam’ Ft Wizkid (Refix). Like every other artist, Seuncee explained that pop culture informs his kind of music. “I grew up listening to the music of Kelly, Michael Jackson, the classic foundational rap of 2pac, and then turning it all on its head by enjoying the mastery of tunesmiths like Lionel Richie,” he said. The singer said he joined his church’s children choir at an early age in other to lay the foundation of pursuing a career in music. “Realising all I wanted to do was live, work and breathe music, my professional career started as a singer/songwriter. Then when College beckoned, I moved to Ilorin, in pursuit of a degree but I found more than that as I was exposed to the world of music. Eager to learn and grow, I convinced my mother and she bought me my first laptop to support my passion and talent,” he recalled. After moving to Lagos, Seuncee has been able to showcase his talent and interacted with several creatives in the metropolis before the release of his EP.
