 A MEMBER of the House of Representatives from Rivers State, Dr. Farah Dagogo, has said the Federal Government’s COVID-19 National Home Grown School Feeding Programme (NHGSFP) is a scam and dishonest scheme. Dagogo, who represents Degema/Bonny Federal Constituency, spoke through his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Ibrahim Lawal, in a statement in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital. He said: “Having gauged the pulse of my constituents and those of others from other constituencies, I want to strongly urge the Federal Government to have a re-think on the matter of continuing with the Home Grown School Feeding Programme now that schools are not in session. “Rather than continue with the programme at this time, the funds for the programme should be re-channelled to the Health sector to strengthen and sustain the fight against COVID-19 pandemic. There is no gainsaying the fact that this measure would be more effective and results-oriented than continuing with the school feeding programme with the pupils at home. “The COVID-19 pandemic has not only succeeded in exposing the decay and rot in our Health sector, it has also shown that lies and deceit cannot last forever. How do you justify spending billions of naira on a bogus school feeding programme when schools are in lockdown? “How does it even sound? Is this not part of the corruption we claim we are fighting? According to Abraham Lincoln, you can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time. That’s exactly what is playing out.”
