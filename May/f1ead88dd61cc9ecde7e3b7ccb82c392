Lesotho Prime Minister Thomas Thabane has announced his resignation. This is coming after months of pressure in which he was named as a suspect in the murder of his ex-wife. Meanwhile, his party said a new PM would be sworn in on Tuesday. The 80-year-oldâ€™s current wife, with whom he was living at the time of the murder, was charged in connection with the killing in February. The pair has denied any involvement.
