Tension mounts in two communities in Anambra State following the alleged burning of six houses in renewed hostilities. The houses were razed on Saturday night in Allah-Onugwa in Olumbanasa, Anambra West Local Government Area of State. Allah-Onugwa and Odekpe have been at daggers drawn over land. The latest skirmish came less than three weeks after a bloody clash between both villages which reportedly left seven persons dead and about 153 houses burnt. A source told The Nation on Sunday that the attackers came from Odekpe. He said, “They came near our primary school in the morning and started shouting. “Our people kept quiet, nobody confronted them. They later went back. In the evening around 5pm, they came back again. “Our people went to our primary school and withstood them not knowing that they had divided themselves in groups. Some moved in from the front, some went to the back and invaded our community through the bush. “They started burning the remaining houses; so our people ran away. They pursued us to the village that we ran to for safety. That was what happened. Nobody was killed.” He said that throughout the period the battle lasted, policemen did not come to their village to quell the situation. Efforts to get the Odekpe perspective from a youth leader in the village, Mr Ernest Udoba, proved abortive as his cell phone was switched off. Police spokesman  Mohammed Haruna said that the police command had no information about any fresh crisis between the two villages. Haruna said, “All I know is that joint security forces are there and they are monitoring the situation. And we have not received any information”.
