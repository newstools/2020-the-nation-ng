Former Lagos State Commissioner for Public Transportation Chief Lanre Razak said on Monday that efforts of President Muhammadu Buhari and Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to contain the deadly Covid-19 deserved commendation, not condemnation. Razak, a member of the Lagos State All Progressives Congress (APC) Governor’s Advisory Council (GAC), slammed the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) for blaming the President for the spread of the pandemic. He said the opposition should not politicise the disease. Razak said all hands must be on deck to halt the Coronavirus from spreading, rather than condemning the ruling APC and the Federal Government to score cheap political points. Razak, the Balogun of Epe, hailed the Federal and Lagos State governments over the manner they had handled the pandemic. In a statement in Lagos, he said that steps already taken included the setting up of Presidential Task Force headed by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr. Boss Mustapha, comprising professionals, adding that they were manifestations that Nigeria was on the path of combating the disease. According to him, the committee, which gives daily update on Covid-19, has given Nigerians confidence that the governments will spare no efforts to guarantee their safety and welfare. Praising the Federal Government for its guidelines of easing the five-week lockdown in Lagos and Ogun states, as well as the Federal Capital Territory, which was already causing untold hardship on the people, Razak said the strategy has allowed for saving the national economy from collapse and ensuring financial survival of the people. He commended Sanwo-Olu for his efforts in treating patients at the isolation centres and preventing further spread of the virus.
