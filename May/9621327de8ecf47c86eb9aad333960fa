 Governor of Bauchi State Bala Mohammed has further approved a coastal bus and two cars for Wikki Tourists to ease the club’s transportation worries after the Coronavirus pandemic. Governor Mohammed reportedly met with the head coach of Wikki Tourists, Usman Abd’Allah and the Chairman of the Club, Alhaji Balarabe Yusuf otherwise known as Douglas recently and discussed the way forward for the Giant Elephants and also donated the three vehicles to the team. NationSport source said that the 32-seater coaster is to be used by the players as a replacement for the rickety one they have been managing while the head coach and Chairman of the club were also presented with official vehicles. Our Correspondent confirmed that Governor Mohammed had last month handed another vehicle for the technical crew members and that the Governor is doing all these to ensure that Bauchi becomes the hub of football in Nigeria again. It was further reported that the Governor promised both Abd’Allah and Yusuf that despite the financial challenges occasioned by the Coronavirus pandemic, there won’t be any deductions in the salaries of the Wikki Tourists players and officials and that they will also be paid promptly. Wikki Tourists are 15th on the league table with 31 points from 25 games before the season was suspended because of Coronavirus pandemic.
