 THE Federal Government has pledged to construct 10,000 houses for 9,000 Borno internally displaced persons (IDPs) whose homes were destroyed by fire on Monday. Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development Minister, Hajia Sadiya Farouk, said this would enable the IDPs return home to rebuild their lives. Two persons were killed in the fire which razed 1,913 thatched houses and destroyed other properties at the Muna Albadawi IDP Camp in Maiduguri, the state capital. Speaking during her visit to the camp, Farouk said President Muhammadu Buhari shared in the victims’ pains. The President, she explained, was worried about the frequent fires  at IDP camps and opted for the construction of houses as the way out. According to the minister, the assistance would involve sustainable home-grown models for rehabilitation, recovery and reconstruction. She presented 95 trailer loads of assorted grains, beans, condiments, among others, and non-food items including zinc, wood, mattresses, blankets, buckets, mosquito nets, mats for distribution to 1,913 households comprising 9000 beneficiaries. Earlier, at the Government House, the minister commiserated with Governor Babagana Zulum, while expressing sadness at the tragic loss of life and property. She praised the Borno State Government for its prompt response and thanked the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) for the immediate activation of the Crisis Response Protocol. Zulum, who led the minister to the camp, thanked the Federal Government for its gesture and pledged that the donations would be fairly distributed.
