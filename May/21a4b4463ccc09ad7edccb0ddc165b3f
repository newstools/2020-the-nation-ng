Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare has run the rules on what the Super Eagles head coach, Gernot Rohr must do following the extension of his contract. The Nigeria Football Federation President, Amaju Pinnick had on Wednesday announced that both the federation and the German have reached an agreement on two-year contract extension to as his previous deal lapses in June. The minister said he had no issue with the extension of Rohr’ stay but he insisted that it would not be business as usual. “He must have been world standard. When it comes to world standard coaches too they vary at various levels. With the conditions we are putting, I think it is only fair if he has accepted, let him continue. “But then we are going to hold him to a higher standard of responsibility to a greater depth of technicality in our football and to a greater level of success. Dare further pointed out that Rohr could have his contract reviewed if he is not headed to the direction that had been outlined in the terms of the contract.
