A conglomerate, Simba Group, has donated food items, including hundreds of bags of rice and millet, as well as safety and hygiene products, to villagers in Argungu, Kebbi State. The group is also distributing the items to commercial motorcycle and tricycle (keke) riders across the country to help cushion the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, especially for daily wage earners. The Emir of Argungu, His Royal Highness Sama’ila Mohammadu Mera, said it was vital that relief materials reach the most vulnerable. National Directorate of Employment Director-General, Dr. Nasiru Muhammad Ladan, who was a guest at the event, thanked Simba Group for also giving out facemasks and hand sanitisers to those who need them most. “Millions of people are employed in the motorcycle and tricycle industry and provide a vital service of point to point transportation in all parts of the country. “Kudos to Simba TVS for looking out for them and the larger community who rely on daily fares for earning their livelihoods,” Ladan said.
