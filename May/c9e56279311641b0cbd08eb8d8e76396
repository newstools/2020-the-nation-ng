He noted that since the incidence of the pandemic, state governments have grappled with feeding the vulnerable and the very poor, adding that IDL sees it an obligation to stand with the state government and the rest of the public at this time of distress.” Receiving the donation on behalf of the Ogun state government, the Deputy Governor, Mrs. Noimot Salako-Oyedele commended the management of IDL, saying the donations will help cushion effects which the lockdown has had on the people. In his response, the Commissioner of Agriculture, Lagos state, Mr. Gbolahan Lawal noted that the Lagos state government will put the donated items by IDL into judicious use.
