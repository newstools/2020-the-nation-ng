 The Osun State government has confirmed the newly recorded COVID-19 case in the state is a medical doctor. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), on Sunday, announced new case of COVID-19 in Nigeria, and Osun State recorded one. A statement on Monday by the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Mr Ismail Omipidan, noted that the Commissioner of Health, Dr Rafiu Isamotu, said, “With the new case recorded, it brings to four the number of active cases in the State as at today, Monday, May 11, 2020.” He said: “The State on Sunday recorded another case of the COVID-19. He is a medical doctor based in Lagos who came into the State on Saturday to be with his family and suspected he was having the virus on arrival and checked into our Isolation Centre at Asubiaro rather than going home. His sample was collected and sent for testing. His result came out on Sunday and turned positive. “We are glad that he didn’t have contact with anyone but took the initiative to check himself into our isolation centre immediately he arrived in Osun. That way, the virus was contained”. The Commissioner reminded residents to adhere strictly to the dusk-to-dawn (6 am-5 pm) curfew on Monday to Thursday and the total lockdown on Friday to Sunday put in place by the State government, saying that it was for the benefit of all. Isamotu added: “The cases recorded in the State recently were of those who came into the State and I want to appeal to our people to stop encouraging their relatives or friends to return to Osun as this might endanger the lives of our people. “Let me also urge the residents to adhere strictly to the dusk to dawn curfew and lockdown measures put in place by the State government to contain the spread of the virus. This is for the benefit of all of us.”
