A man, Afobaje Maiyegun, who allegedly battered his wife and was filmed in a viral video boasting about the assault has been arrested by the police in Lagos. Lagos Coordinator of Domestic and Sexual Violence Response Team (DSVRT), Mrs Titilola Vivour-Adeniyi, said he will be charged to court on Friday. Vivour-Adeniyi said on Thursday that Maiyegun dared his bleeding wife to call police on him, saying he was “waiting for her police”. She said a team of DSVRT  reached out to ACP Gbolahan  Odugbemi, Area Commander, Area J Police Station, who arrested Maiyegun. It was gathered that this was not the first time Maiyegun would beat his wife. Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Thursday reminded residents of the state’s zero tolerance for sexual and gender-based violence, warning that perpetrators will face the full weight of the law.
