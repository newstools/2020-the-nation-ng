Governors expecting cash bail out to manage the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic may have to read the body language of President Muhammadu Buhari. One of them was looking for N15billion as asking price before taking action to contain the pandemic. The President refused to look at his side. But the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, who featured on a radio programme ‘As E Dey Hot’ on Wazobia FM, Kano on Thursday, said those expecting free money will never get it. He said: “The Federal Government is moved by what it saw, and say, ah! This state needs help, and then it helped Lagos State. “Any other state that is also doing its work and is not complaining, and is not saying bring money, bring money, bring money, the Federal Government will do all that is necessary to do to assist. “Technical support is very, very important. Lagos State got technical support before it got financial support. Manpower support is very good. Facility support, very good.
