The Abia State Government has declared a suspected COVID-19 patient, Emmanuel Ononiwu, wanted. Ononiwu was said to have tested positive and refused to isolatate himself as requested by appropriate medical protocol. The Commissioner of Information, John Okiyi-Kalu, in a statement yesterday said Ononiwu, residing at Aba, escaped from a temporary holding facility in Aba, prior to his movement to an isolation centre, after he was informed of his status. All subsequent appeals made to him through his phone line; 08033484117, fell on deaf ears, as he insisted that he will not turn himself in. He had switched off his line along with that of his spouse, required to present herself for testing. Okiyi-Kalu stated that the last tracked location of Ononiwu was around Asa Triangle in Aba South Local Government. “If seen anywhere, please report to the nearest security agency or call 0700 2242 362, but do not approach him without full protection to avoid infection. “Enforcement teams all over the state are also advised to be on the look out and take him in as soon as he is found. “All those who had contact with him in the past 14 days are strongly advised to call 0700 2242 362 and submit themselves for testing. “We strongly advise all citizens and residents to be vigilant and take necessary measures to protect themselves. “Do not leave your house without wearing your face mask appropriately and ensure you maintain social distance at all times. “COVID-19 is real and if we take responsibility as individuals we can win the battle against the virus in our state and country.”
