Driving schools are offering life-saving services and should therefore not be a target of the tax authorities and agencies for high rate of taxes and levies. Driving School Association of Nigeria (DSAN) should be engaged in dialogue on regular basis with the Federal and state governments as well as the relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies on issues relating to driving schools, driver education, Transportation and road safety because driving schools are the ultimate executors of the policies and regulations on transportation, driving and safety. Insurance firms in Nigeria should give special premium concessions to the public and private sector organisations that regularly train their drivers. A day should be set aside during the United Nations’ Remembrance of Road Accident victims (Third week of November) to mark the Drivers Day in Nigeria — a day for the promotion of quality driver education, driver motivation and Safety on Nigeria roads. Consequent upon the universally acclaimed fact that over 70 percent of road traffic crashes are attributable to drivers (major Component of the Human Factors), there should be more focus and supports for driver education particularly through driving schools. Driving schools, through the DSAN, should be seen and treated as a major stakeholder in transportation and road safety as it obtains in other countries. It is time for all arms of government (Executive, Legislative and Judiciary), regulatory agencies, employers of drivers and other stakeholders to pay more attention to road transportation and driver education for safer road use in Nigeria.
