 President Muhammadu Buhari has lost one of his nephews, Alhaji Mutari Dauda, to death. Dauda was younger brother to Mallam Mamman Daura, who has been described as one of the strongest influences on Buhari and the administration. The President has sent condolence messages to his extended family and the entire Daura community in Katsina State over the death of Alhaji Dauda. In a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, Buhari charged the family of the deceased as well as the entire extended family, to pray for the repose of the departed. He said: “Let me on behalf of myself and my family convey to you my deepest sympathy for the loss of Mutari Dauda. Death is inevitable and every soul must taste death one day. “What we owe the dead are not tears, because our tears can’t bring them back, but what they deserve are our prayers. In this regard, my heart and prayers go out to all the family members and the Daura community as a whole over this irreparable loss.” “May Allah forgive his gentle soul and reward his goods deeds with aljanna. Amin.”
