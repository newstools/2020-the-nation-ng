You guys don’t know that I’ve actually dropped from 6XL to 4XL but most of you are just getting to know me so you will always see a fat boy.  I love my life I’m taking good care of myself and work is still in progress to drop some more,” he wrote as the caption for his new look. Fans on social media have appraised his efforts with encouraging words. “Amazing, Nigeria Rick Ross finally lost weight,” a fan dildo234 tweeted. Another fan, Olamilyh comments, “You dropped wow. You look amazing.” Big Sheff featured his mother, Queen Salawa, on the remix of one of her hit songs, ‘Gentle Lady’.
