At least a dozen of websites were attacked on Thursday by anti-Israel hackers, who posted a video about the destruction of Israel in place of the sites’ normal content. Israeli media reported that the hacked sites featured a video with the message: “The countdown of Israel destruction has begun since a long time ago”. The message was written in Hebrew and English. The images are of what appeared to be a destroyed Tel Aviv. The Israeli web company uPress said in a statement that the deliberate attack had targeted multiple sites it was hosting and that a security gap was found in a WordPress extension. uPress said it was working with Israel’s National Cyber Directorate to conduct an investigation into the hackers behind the attack. According to Israeli media, citing the directorate, the attack was “superficial” and had only targeted a single web hosting company. Earlier, the directorate had issued a warning about cyber attacks ahead of Al-Quds Day, the last Friday of Ramadan when Iran traditionally protests Israel’s 1967 annexation of East Jerusalem. Meanwhile, the Washington Post reported that Israel was behind a cyber attack that had brought traffic at an Iranian port to a standstill. According to the U.S. newspaper, the cyber attack on the port was reportedly in response to an Iranian attempt in April to hack into Israeli water distribution systems. (dpa/NAN)
