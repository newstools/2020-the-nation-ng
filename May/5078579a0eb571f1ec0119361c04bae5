 AN Igbosere Magistrates’ Court in Lagos on Wednesday sent for psychiatric evaluation a nursing mother, Oluwafunmilola Adisa, suspected of killing her baby. Magistrate (Mrs) K. O. Doja-Ojo remanded Adisa, 22, at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), following an application by the Lagos State Office of the Public Defender (OPD). The OPD is representing the suspect pro bono. Its Director, Dr Babajide Martins, applied that Adisa be sent to and remanded at LASUTH “for psychiatric evaluation to help determine the state of her mental health.” He based his application on Section 217 (3) of Lagos State Administration of Criminal Justice Law (ACJL), 2015. Magistrate Doja-Ojo granted the prayer and adjourned till June 26, for the outcome of the tests. Adisa is suspected by the police to have drowned her one-and-a-half-year old daughter, Oluwanifemi, in a bucket of water. Martins said the OPD is representing Adisa in line with its statutory responsibility of providing free legal service for the indigent and vulnerable. He said OPD came to her rescue by providing free legal representation and ensuring that the suspect was timely moved from the State Criminal Investigation Department, Panti to the Federal Psychiatric Hospital, Oshodi as an out- patient pending her arraignment for further judicial action.
