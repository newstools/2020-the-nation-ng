Residents in Badagry, a border town between Nigeria and the Republic of Benin, have been warned not to flout curfew directives. Chairman of Badagry Local Government, Segun Adeniran Onilude and  his Badagry West Local Council Development Area, counterpart, Henugbe Joseph Gbenu, gave the warning after at joint reinforcement COVID-19 security meeting with security chiefs. Gbenu, who chaired the meeting, said the fulcrum of the meeting was to ensure security of the residents. He said a “Joint Task Force on COVID-19 Curfew” has been inaugurated, to be headed by the Air Force Commander, Air Commodore Morakinyo Anthony Akinode. He urged the people to stay at home and avoid unnecessary movement from 8pm to 6am as directed by the Federal Government. Onilude, who was represented by Vice-Chairman, Andrew Akotome lamented the many illegal police checkpoints at Aroko-Iyayin. This, he said, has turned the place to an extortion centre. Onilude enjoined all security personnel to synergise and intensify efforts towards ensuring a peaceful Badagry. The Joint Local Security Committee immediately went on the inspection visit to Aroko-Iyafin where further corrections were made. The meeting, which lasted for hours, had in attendance representatives of all security agencies.
