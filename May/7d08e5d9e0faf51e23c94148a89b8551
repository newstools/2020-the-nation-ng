 The crisis rocking the Osun State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) continued on Thursday, as the former Deputy Chairman, Sunday Akanfe, was inaugurated as the acting chairman in Akure, the Ondo State capital. Akanfe replaced Mr. Soji Adagunodo, whose suspension was ratified by the National Working Committee of the party, over alleged anti-party activities. But Adagunodo insisted that he remained the Osun PDP chairman. Akanfe was inaugurated at the office of the National Vice Chairman (Southwest) of the party and was accompanied by some state working committee members of the party. In a remark after the inauguration, Akanfe promised to ensure that peace returned to the party.  He said he bore no grudge against Adagunodo. Said he: “We don’t have any grudge against Soji Adagunodo. We will resolve our differences when we get home. “I assure you that the PDP under my leadership will close ranks within the party and move it to a greater height. “The state working committee, in the last couple of days, has started reaching out to the aggrieved members of the party and to the glory of God the move has started yielding positive results.” The National Vice Chairman of the party, Mr. Eddy Olafeso, urged the Osun PDP members to work in unity, to take back the state from the All Progressives Congress (APC).
