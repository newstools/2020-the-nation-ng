The Founder of Real Acts of Kindness (RAK) Foundation, a non-governmental organisation (NGO), Mr. Mobolaji Ogunlende, has hailed Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu for being proactive in curbing the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. Ogunlende, who spoke at the weekend while distributing 250 food items received from Victim Support Fund (VSF), to indigents and widows in Badagry, Lagos, said the government had worked hard to prevent the spread of the pandemic. The RAK Foundation founder, who visited the VSF Covid-19 Task Force Chairperson, Mrs. Toyosi Akerele-Ogunsiji, advised Lagosians to adhere to the regulations made by the government to prevent the spread of Coronavirus by maintaining social distancing and washing their hands regularly with soap under running water. He assured Badagry residents that the NGO would collaborate with more Private Public Partnerships (PPPs) to ensure a better living condition for widows and indigents. Ogunlende said that VSF COVID-19 food relief package distribution had been very effective and transparent. Items comprising 10kg of rice, 10kg of beans, 10kg of garri, 10kg of salt and four litres of vegetable oil were packed in 50kg bags. Ninety bags were distributed in Olorunda Local Council Development Area (LCDA), 50 bags in Badagry West LCDA and 50 bags in Badagry Local Government. “The NGO also distributed 39 bags in riverine communities from Ojo to Badagry, while the remaining 21 bags were given to select widows within the city,” Ogunlende said. He hailed the task force for their timely intervention at a critical time. Mrs. Hannah Azon, one of the beneficiaries, thanked VSF for their support.
