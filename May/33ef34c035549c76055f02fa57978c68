 Organisers of Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL)  are still in dilemma  on how to end the current 2019/2020 which was put on hold in March  following the  outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic. This much was revealed yesterday by the League Management Company (LMC) chairman  Mallam Shehu Dikko during a breakfast TV Sports show as he presented four likely scenarios towards the conclusion of the season. With agitation for the restart of the season or  possible  cancellation by  stakeholders, Dikko  said the  four options have been carefully weighed and one of the options could be adopted after exhaustive deliberation with club managers and other relevant stakeholders. “We have had several private meetings with Government over the last week to sound them out, feel the pulse and determine what could be possible in view of the challenges,” stated Dikko. “Four options were available to be considered towards conclusion of the NPFL subject to government approvals and time permitting .”  According to Dikko, the league maybe called off while the  LMC  would organize a playoff (which would be a one venue event for 7-10 days) to determine the  winner &  CAF slots. He equally said  clubs can be converged  in a one  state venue and play  the remaining matches within three  stadia that  are normally not more than 2 -3hrs apart  and conclude the remaining matches within 5-6 weeks playing  three  games a week and with all the quarantine and testing requirements. But Dikko informed nothing was yet cast in stone as the LMC is in constant discussion with government  and relevant authorities charged with responsibilities of eradicating COVID-19. The NPFL was  suspended after MatchDay 25 but Dikko is optimistic of a possible restart in the coming months.
