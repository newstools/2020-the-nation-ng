The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has demanded the prosecution of the sacked Director-General of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Mustapha Maihaja. The party tasked the Federal Government on the alleged N5.8 billion scandal, reportedly unearthed by an investigative committee of the House of Representatives. In a statement on Monday by the spokesman for the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, the party also tasked the government over N33 billion NEMA funds allegedly embezzled by Maihaja, an engineer. PDP slammed the government for merely sacking Maihaja without investigating and prosecuting him for the alleged financial impropriety and making attempts to recover the alleged funds. The statement said: “The PDP stands with Nigerians in rejecting this unpardonable pat on the wrist and allowing Maihaja to leave office without investigation and prosecution to recover the allegedly embezzled fund. “Our party believes that the failure to prosecute the indicted former NEMA Director-General is a ploy to shield top officials in the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led administration, who are alleged to be involved in the series of scam in NEMA, while the masses, for whom the fund was meant to serve, continue to suffer neglect and untold hardships. “The PDP insists that the sacking of  Maihaja should not be used as an excuse to foreclose an investigation into the huge fraud in NEMA.” The party described the alleged sleaze in NEMA as an indelible smear on the Federal Government and urged the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to probe Maihaja.
