 Following successes recorded in containing COVID-19 in Ondo State, indications have emerged that worship centres in the state might soon be allowed to open. Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu gave the indication yesterday during his weekly briefing on update on COVID-19 in the state. The Ondo Governor said he would meet with religious leaders and other stakeholders within the state to explore ways of returning religious worship to the society. Akeredolu promised to accelerate the consultations and review after which ‘the people will hear from me very soon.’ Governor Akeredolu noted that out of the 20 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 13 have been discharged, one died and six currently receiving treatment. Akeredolu said the data showed Ondo health workers were competent and ready to save lives. He noted that his greatest concerns were interstate importation and community transmission of COVID-19. Governor Akeredolu said massive contact tracing has begun for the 20th case recorded as the patient has been resident in the state. “The implication is that having been infected, she might also have come in contact with others thereby enlarging the circle. This is what community transmission means. It is dangerous, deadly and undesirable. We must therefore all collaborate to stop the threat. “I wish to admonish all residents of Ondo state to remain vigilant and dedicate themselves to community care by reporting all suspicions to our health workers and our rapid response team available on the specially designated toll-free numbers.” Deputy Governor of the state, Ajayi Agboola, on Monday made his first public appearance at the briefing. Many of his aides were also present. This is the first Agboola would be appearing at the same function with Governor Akeredolu after many weeks. The relationship between Governor Akeredolu and his Deputy has since hit the rocks.
