Former Edo State Deputy Governor Pius Odubu has distanced himself from a story in some newspapers accusing the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, APC National Leader Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and businessman Captain Hosa Okunbo of teaming up to endorse one of the governorship aspirants in Edo State. In a statement he signed, Dr. Odubu said: “My attention has been drawn to a misleading story trending on the APC social media platform, casting aspersions on very prominent and highly respected members of our society, trying to connect them with the recent happenings in our party. “I wish to state categorically that I have no hand in this, neither did I authorise such a despicable article. Captain Okunbo, Asiwaju Tinubu and Comrade Oshiomhole are men of impeccable character and I have uttermost respect for all of them. Nobody should under any guise associate me with anything that will cast aspersion on their hard-earned reputations.” Continuing, he said: “For the embarrassment this might have caused them, I offer my sincere apologies. Please let it be known that the writer is not known to me, neither does he have my authority to do what he did. I wish to state categorically that I did not authorise this piece directly or through any of my agents that was intended to cast aspersions on the integrity and highly earned reputations of the leaders under reference. “No doubt this article, which is clearly false, is another attempt to paint me in bad light before these very eminent persons. May I, therefore,  reassure our leaders of my maximum respect always.”
