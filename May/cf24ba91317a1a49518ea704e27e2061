 More tributes are being showered on the former Pro-Chancellor/Chairman of Lagos State University (LASU) Justice Isiaka Oluwa. Frontline lawyer and former Federal Commissioner for Works under General Yakubu Gowon Alhaji Lateef Olufemi Okunnu (SAN), said the late Oluwa would be remembered for ensuring Lagos State University (LASU) Faculty of Law had the distinction as the best in Criminal Law nationwide during his time in the saddle. The late justice passed on Saturday 9th of this month.He was 102.Until his death, he was Pro-Chancellor/Chairman of Council of LASU between 1988 and 1990. “During his term as LASU Pro-Chancellor, the university had the best programme in Criminal Law nationwide.  He had that distinction and maintained it until he relinquished the office. Incidentally Isale-Eko Descendants Union of which he also formerly chaired, was to later institute an annual ‘Justice Oluwa prize for best student in Criminal Law’ in LASU,” Okunnu said.  Oluwa, Okunnu explained, also ensured that as the third chairman of the then Isale Eko Descendants Scholarship Committee, many students of Isale Eko origin had the opportunity of scholarships that made them realise their ambition. Going down memory lane, Okunnu recounted how Isale Eko Descendants Scholarship Committee was birthed in 1972 by the late Justice Teslim Elias who was a one time President of the World Court in the Hague, and with the sole purpose of facilitating scholarships for natives of Isale-Eko. “He (Elias) gathered some of us to donate to fund to educate children of Isale Eko origin. As we grew older and older, generation passed on, we assumed full ownership of IDU. “Justice Oluwa was the third chairman of the scholarship committee. I must say he served IDU and Lagos State very well. “Besides, he had always wanted governments to govern justly. “He had the welfare of his people at heart.He always emphasised that once you had an opportunity to be in any high position, always think about the masses.”
