Nigeria striker Odion Ighalo said on Friday that he hopes his loan deal at Manchester United is extended until the Premier League season is completed following the coronavirus lockdown. The 30-year-old moved to Old Trafford from Chinese side Shanghai Shenhua in January and has a contract until May 31. Premier League bosses hope to resume the season in June but China’s Super League is also edging towards the start of their season after it was delayed by COVID-19. “I would like to finish the season if it’s possible,” Ighalo told BBC Sport. I was in good form, good shape, scoring goals and now we’ve stopped now for over a month. I’ve given it my best and hopefully we’ll come back to play. “The team had a good momentum before the pandemic started. At the moment I’m on loan, and this will cut short my time at the club.” Read Also: Man United delay Ighalo’s decision United are reportedly keen to extend Ighalo’s contract even though their attacking worries have eased during the lockdown.
