 GOSPEL reggae singer Chevelle Franklyn has released two new singles amidst the coronavirus pandemic to inspire hope in people across the globe. The two songs released by Franklyn to uplift the spirit are ‘Go In Your Strength,’ and ‘iPrevail.’ The singles, Celebrity Watch gathered, is off Franklyn’s upcoming album entitled ‘South Wind: Vol.1.’ The singer says though the second song, ‘iPrevail,’ was recorded way ahead of its time, it fit into the current situation across the globe.  She says: “iPrevail was written four years ago, and recorded in South Africa. God was ahead of us. We were all set to release our Anthem of the Ages, “Go in Your Strength,” yet God is pushing with this as well. Coronavirus will not take us because of the blood of Jesus prevails.” Speaking about her style of music, Franklyn says: “My versatility is my extra spice. I can bring good fusion in my music. I started out doing secular music such as Dancehall, Reggae, and R&B music, and then when I got saved, I totally committed to doing gospel and spreading the word of God through my music.” Franklyn is a multi-award winning Caribbean worship minister. She has on several editions, graced the stage of Africa’s biggest gospel concert, ‘The Experience’ Lagos, and remains a respected voice in the worship music ministry.
