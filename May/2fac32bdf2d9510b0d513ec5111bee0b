Duku JOEL, Damaturu  Yobe House of Assembly member, Lawan Sani Inua popularly known as Mr. LAS, suspected to have tested positive for coronavirus has denied he refused to be isolated. Inua represents Nguru Central at the Assembly. He is the only Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) opposition member at the Assembly. He denied he was ever asked by anybody to move to any isolation facility, stating the COVID 19 Committee has not inform him of his COVID-19 status. The lawmaker told our correspondent he was not rushed to the hospital as media reports claimed. Inua said he was the one who requested to be tested, wondering why he would refuse to be isolated if positive “What I don’t understand is that nobody has told me that my result of the COVID test has come out positive. “What I am surprised is to hear from people from town that I am positive. I called the Commissioner of Health and spoke with him about it the issue. “To the best of my knowledge, my health status is my prerogative but I am surprised that people are saying I am positive without me being aware. “Again, the allegations that I was asked to go for isolation is very strange to me because nobody has told me from the hospital or any member of the committee to go to isolation. “If I voluntarily requested for a test, why should I refuse to be isolated? I am a leader and I cannot put the live of my people in danger,” he informed. He said he was feeling much better, stating, “As we speak now, I am not feeling anything in my body. “If you and I enter the field to play ball now, I am very sure I could dribble you and score a goal against you.” On whether he will reveal his status if he tests positive,  the lawmaker said: “Why not? If I see my result today, I will tell everybody even if I am positive. “This COVID is not a death sentence. I am a young man and I can recover from this. But if Allah says this is the way my life will end, I cannot change that.”
