Executive Secretary of the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) Simbi Wabote has urged companies handling trainings in the Oil and Gas industry to reposition themselves and redesign their training modules. This, he said, is so they can overcome the challenges created by the Coronavirus pandemic and crash of crude oil price. Wabote spoke at the weekend during a webinar organised by the Oil and Gas Trainers Association of Nigeria (OGTAN), titled “Challenges, Opportunities and New Realities for O&G Trainers”. Warning that the twin challenges of COVID-19 pandemic and low price of crude oil might remain for a considerable time, Wabote said oil and gas training would be negatively impacted because most face to face programmes will no longer hold, and there will be delayed learning interventions, loss of businesses, revenue and jobs. According to him, most oil and gas trainings would likely hold in virtual classrooms and will require virtual machines, simulators and dongles. He added that such trainings would demand high cost of set up, but the operational cost would be lower over time and learning costs would become cheaper. Wabote admitted that virtual learning models might lead to lower assimilation by the trainees and reduced profits for the companies at the onset. He listed critical requirements for training in this regime to include expanded spaces, reduced number of students per classroom, increased cost of instructors, face masks, sanitisers, gloves, soaps and water.
