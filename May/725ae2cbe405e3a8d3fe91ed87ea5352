Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki has said the Federal College of Education at Ekiadolor will boost technical education. The institution is one of the six approved by President Muhammadu Buhari. Obaseki yesterday inspected work at the Tayo Apkata University of Education, where the new college would be sited. He noted that the institution would boost training of Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) teachers. He noted that the institution would specialise in training TVET teachers to complement his administration’s focus on technical education. “We applied to President Buhari to have one of the planned six federal colleges of Education sited here, and the President approved it. “The government has additional capacity to drive TVET with establishment of this institution. We would have a college …that specialises in training teachers for technical and vocational subjects …” The governor said Federal Government officials would visit the state to inspect the institution ahead of academic activities. Obaseki noted that workers of the former institution would be redeployed to the state College of Education with three campuses once the bill establishing the institution was passed.
