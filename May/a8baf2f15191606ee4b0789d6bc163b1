 THERE are currently 5,324 beds located in 112 treatment and isolation centres across the country, Minister of State for Health Adeleke Mamora said yesterday. He noted that only five states including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) have met the requirement of at least 300 beds for treatment and isolation centres. Twenty-one states still have less than 100 bed spaces, he said. He spoke at the daily briefing of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 in Abuja. Mamora said: “At present, we have a total of 112 treatment and isolation centres in all the 36 states and FCT with 5,324 beds. While only five states including the FCT have at least 300 beds as prescribed for isolation and treatment, 21 states have less than 100 bed spaces. “As the number of confirmed cases increases, there is an urgent need to expand our treatment centres across the country. I therefore call on state Governors and philanthropists to take active and deliberate steps to scale up the number of beds for isolation and treatment of confirmed cases in their states.”  Mamora said there had been an improvement in the number of recoveries from COVID-19 and number of deaths has generally reduced. “There is general reduction in mortality trend and continuous improvement in recoveries as shown in discharges compared to the increase in number of confirmed cases. “Though not surprising, we are concerned about the increasing number of confirmed cases. This is because very high cases could seriously exceed the capacity of our health system to cope. Routine cases may also suffer as a result. Therefore, non-pharmaceutical preventive approach is still our best strategy.” “While most of those who die are associated with co-morbidities, we find that 3 out of 4 of those who have been discharged were without co-morbidities. This is consistent with the fact that risks are higher for those with other illnesses such as hypertension, diabetes and other chronic non- communicable diseases,” he said.
