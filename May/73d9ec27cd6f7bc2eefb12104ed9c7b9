 EDO State All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship aspirant Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu on Wednesday said that he will beat Governor Godwin Obaseki at the primary. But, the governor said he was confident of winning re-election because “power comes from God.” He said the governor cannot get the second term ticket because he has alienated party members in his first term. Ize-Iyamu recalled that Obaseki was more or less imposed on the state, stressing that he has disappointed the party and those that supported his first term bid. Speaking on a television programme after collecting his nomination form in Abuja, he said the direct primary being proposed by the party’s national leadership was in order. Ize-Iyamu accused the governor of chasing shadows and oppressing party members instead of focusing on governance. He maintained that he will beat the governor at the primary, stressing: “I am an Edo person. The governor has not done well. The criticism would have been louder if we are not in the same party with him. “Primaries are done by political parties. Political parties are about members. You said the members are not important, the party members you insulted and disgraced. In a free and fair primary, Obaseki cannot emerge.” But, Obaseki, in an earlier interview with the station, said he was confident that the way he got into power is the same way he would return. “God gave me power. If he wants me to return I will continue. No man can stop me. Power comes from God,” he said. Obaseki said he believes an election should not lead to bloodshed. The governor said he was not distracted, adding that his focus is on developing Edo State. “Our concern is to use the resources of the people to develop the state. “This shouldn’t lead to bloodshed. We will not accept to be cowed and intimidated because some people think that they can manipulate rules and cut corners,” he added.
