 The Peace and Reconciliation Committee of the Zamfara State government headed by the state Commissioner of Police, Usman Nagogo, has secured the release of twelve kidnapped victims. The victims were abducted two weeks ago and rescued when by repentant bandits.. Usman Nagogo said the rescue of the victims was a fulfilment of the pledge made by the repentant bandits to fight their kinsmen who refused to embrace peace and reconciliation offered by the state government. He applauded the repentant bandits for “the confidence they repose in the state government and security agencies, especially the police in ensuring the success of the peace process.”  He called on them to sustain the tempo, while “the security agencies will continue to partner them to ensure peace and security in the state”. In his response, the Commissioner for Security and  Home Affairs, Alhaji Mohammed Abubakar Dauran, who represented the governor praised the security agencies for their  commitment in the restoration of peace in Zamfara State. Dauran stated that the state government would continue to adopt dialogue and engagement as a way of overcoming its security challenges while  recalcitrant bandits would be dealt with squarely . Dauran urged citizens of the state and the rescued victims to be prayerful for the sustenance of peace in Zamfara and Nigeria in general.
