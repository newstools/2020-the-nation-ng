 The German Football League has announced that the Bundesliga season will resume play on Saturday May 16. Politicians backed the league to continue their season behind closed doors, and the football authorities confirmed that next weekend will see games return.  German chancellor Angela Merkel told regional authorities on Wednesday that the competition could restart in the second half of May.  The 36 clubs held a conference call on Thursday to finalise a resumption date which was later announced by DFL managing director Christian Seifert.
