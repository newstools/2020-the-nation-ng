 Council of Yoruba Chiefs and Obas in the 19 Northern States and Abuja on Monday hailed President Muhammadu Buhari over the appointment of Professor Ibrahim Agboola Gambari as his new Chief of Staff. The Council said the appointment of Gambari, a diplomat and scholar was apt, especially at a time Nigeria is struggling to defeat the dreaded Coronavirus pandemic. Chairman of the Council, Ambassador Mohammed Arigbabuwo in a statement made available to newsmen in Kaduna on Sunday said, Professor Gambari possesses the credentials to help coordinate office of the President to confront the challenges facing the nation. According to Arigbabuwo, Gambari’s appointment, was coming at a time the country was grappling with the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome known as coronavirus, disease which has created new challenges for both lives and livelihoods in Nigeria and worldwide. “COVID: 19 is a major challenge in Nigeria not only to life, but to our economy. We believe Professor Gambari would assist the President to upscale the good work of the Presidential Task Force in coordinating and overseeing Nigeria’s multi-sectoral inter-governmental efforts to contain the spreading of the disease and propel our economy to a proper place. As former United Nations Under-Secretary General and Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Africa (1999-2005), former Chairman of the United Nations Special Committee Against Apartheid (1990-1994) and on Peace-Keeping Operations (1990—1999) and Head of the United Nations Department of Political Affairs (2005-2007) and UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy on Cyprus, Zimbabwe and Myanmar and Special Representative in Angola, the labour leader said, Professor Gambari is better positioned to mobilize important material and policy resources to deliver on his assigned duties,” he said. The Northern Yoruba Obas however congratulated the Kwara State Government and the Emir of Ilorin on the appointment of one of their illustrious sons as the Chief of Staff to the President.
