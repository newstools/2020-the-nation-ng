 THE Federal Government on Tuesday explained why it is being cautious in lifting restrictions on the gradual reopening of the economy. It is to avoid dragging the nation back to the beginning of the pandemic. The government said that although the country moving towards further relaxation of the lockdown, the government said it was not convinced that the time has come in terms of the impact of the pandemic to further relax those restrictions. National Coordinator of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19, Dr. Aliyu Sani disclosed this at the briefing of the PTF on Tuesday. On Monday, the PTF announced the extension of the easing of lockdown to allow a gradual reopening of the economy in six weeks. Dr. Sani said: “The PTF certainly appreciates the adverse impact this is having on people’s livelihood but as I keep on saying, we are trying to balance saving lives with saving livelihood. We are in the process of moving towards further relaxation of the lockdown but as far as the next two weeks are concerned nothing has changed. “We have been given approval by Mr. President to extend those same conditions we had two weeks ago for very good reasons. One, being that we are not convinced that the time has come in terms of the impact of the pandemic to further relax those restrictions. “As we all know, the level of compliance with some of those guidelines we have provided has been limited at best in some areas and we have to make sure that whatever we do in terms of taking actions or decisions we do not drag ourselves back to the beginning of the pandemic again. We do appreciate this. It is one of the things we will continue to consider as we monitor the next two weeks.”
