The Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital (NAUTH), Nnewi, Anambra State has refuted a report that the hospital recorded one coronavirus death last Sunday. The Chief Medical Director, Prof. Anthony Igwegbe who disclosed this in Nnewi in a chat with reporters, yesterday, described the report as false, saying the hospital had never recorded any single positive case for COVID-19 since the pandemic started let alone death as all tests so far had returned negative. He said the hospital under the coordination of Anambra State team of epidemiologists and the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) had been running tests on suspected patients all this while with none of the samples returning positive. He wondered why a case of death of a Coronavirus victim would be reported on the hospital without verification from the hospital management.
