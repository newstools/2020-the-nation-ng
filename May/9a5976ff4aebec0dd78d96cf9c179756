 River Hoopers coach, Ogoh Odaudu, has commended organisers of Basketball Africa League (BAL) for their optimism towards hosting the tournament post  Coronavirus pandemic. Odaudu  who doubles a  D’Tigers assistant coach, said that the organisers have continued to liaise with his team despite a halt to sporting activities due to the pandemic. “Everything is at a standstill but they are just being hopeful that this situation will ease out soon and since it is the inaugural edition, they want it to hold no matter how small they do it,” he said. “Nobody knows what the situation is right now but I can tell you that we are not training because we cannot gather in large numbers.  At least let’s play some basketball even if it is in the later part of the year when everything has calm down but safety is first.” and I know they will not take any decision until they know that they are not endangering the health of the players and officials,” the former D’Tigers point guard added. To ensure his players stay fit, Odaudu said that a training programme has been sent to them (the players) and they are expected to send videos of their training to the coaching crew as evidence, noting that he doesn’t want the players to come back rusty.
