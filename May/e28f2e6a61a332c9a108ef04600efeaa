A mob on Saturday night killed three members of a popular gang, Shila boys, in Yola, capital of Adamawa State.
The boys, whose trademark is dispossessing people of their belongings in streets, had operated successfully in the Jimeta area of the capital city. But a group of angry residents mobilised to pursue and deal with them. The crowd attacked and killed the three Shila boys, who had snatched a phone from a resident around Nasarawo, a sprawling residential community in Jimeta, Yola North local government area. The gang, which frequently operates in Keke NAPEP rob passengers or ride in same vehicle and snatch valuables. It ‘works’ usually in Yola North and Yola South LGAs and to a smaller extent in neighbouring Girei LGA.
The Adamawa State Police Public Relations officer (PPRO), Suleiman Nguroje, confirmed the incident, explaining how unlucky the Shila Boys were this time. Nguroje said: “Normally, the Shila Boys go out in a group of three or four to attack citizens. They took advantage of somebody whom they followed, injured and took away his handset. People around there who saw what happened ran after the Shila Boys and lynched them.” He lamented that the incident happened at 9 pm on Saturday despite the 8pm to 6 am curfew imposed by Governor Ahmadu Fintiri about a week ago. According to him, the boys were still alive when the police arrived the scene. “When the attention of the police was drawn, some officers rushed to the scene and found the Shila Boys unconscious,” he said, adding that they were rushed to hospital for treatment but they were later confirmed dead.
