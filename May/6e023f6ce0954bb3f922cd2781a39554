Nigerian Football Ambassador and former  Super Eagles striker Daniel Amokachi has  reportedly donated  food items and other provisions  to thousands of Kaduna residents as per  COVID-19 palliatives. The distribution was presented under the umbrella of Amokachi Foundation with over 1,100 families getting food items and provisions. According to Ex-Everton of England marksman: “This is my little contribution to help the needy in this COVID-19 period. I consider it a special honour and privilege by God to assist the less-privilege in our society.” He said the gesture was extended mostly to women as mothers are responsible for the catering of the family. The beneficiaries thanked Amokachi for the gesture, declaring it as timely and special. Amokachi was earlier this year named football Ambassador by the Federal Government and the ceremonial role is expected to motivate young Nigerians.
