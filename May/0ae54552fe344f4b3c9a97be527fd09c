 NOLLYWOOD actress Chacha Eke Faani took some time to share her thoughts on how parents should bond with their wards. The actress, in a long post on her Instagram page, noted that some parents’ harsh treatment towards their kids is why they lack good relationships. According to her, if children lie too often to their parents “it is because you over-react too harshly to their inappropriate behaviour”. Faani opined that children suffer low self-esteem when parents advise them more than they encourage. She wrote “If your children are not taught to confide in you about their mistakes, you’ve lost them, If your children do not stand up for themselves, it is because from a young age you have disciplined them regularly in public, If your children take things that do not belong to them, it is because when you buy them things, you don’t let them chose what they want.  She continued; “If your children are cowardly, it is because you help them too quickly if your children do not respect other people’s feelings, it is because instead of speaking, your order and command them, If your children are too quick to anger, it is because you give too much attention to misbehaviour & you give little attention to good behaviour, if your children are excessively jealous, it is because you congratulate them only when they successfully complete something and not when they improve at something even if they don’t successfully complete it, if your children intentionally disturb you, it is because you are not physically affectionate enough. “If your children are openly defiant, it is because you openly threaten to do something but don’t follow through, If your child is secretive, it is because they are sure that you would blow things out of proportion, If your children back-answer to you, it is because they watch you do it to others & think its normal behaviour, if your children don’t listen to you but listen to others, it is because you are too quick to jump to conclusions If your children rebel it is because they know you care more about what others think than what is right”.
