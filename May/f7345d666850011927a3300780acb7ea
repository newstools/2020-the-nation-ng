As the Muslim Ummah in the country celebrate this year’s Eid el-Fitr, the Inspector-General of Police, IGP Mohammed Adamu, has said that socio-religious gatherings remain prohibited. While congratulating Nigerians on the celebration, Adamu said the successful conclusion of the Ramadan, a period of self-denial geared towards attaining wholesomeness, reinforces his belief that with the citizens’ collective perseverance and voluntary compliance with the prevention regulations emplaced by Governments at all levels, the nation will surely overcome the COVID-19 pandemic. In a statement by the Force Public Relations Officer, Force Headquarters, Abuja, DCP Frank Mba, on Friday, Adamu assured the nation of adequate security during and after the Eid el-Fitr celebrations. He said proactive and robust anti-crime measures, including the deployments of tactical and intelligence assets of the Force are already in place to prevent any untoward incidents in the country. “The Force however reminds the citizens that the COVID-19 prevention regulation orders including the inter-state movement restriction orders, national curfew and the prohibition of mass socio-religious gatherings by the Federal Government in Lagos, Ogun, Kano States and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), and restriction orders by Governments in some States of the Federation, are still in force. “It therefore enjoins the citizens to observe the Eid celebrations bearing in mind the unusual times occasioned by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic as the Force will leave no stone unturned towards the due enforcement of the orders,” the statement read.
