 A telecoms service provider, 9mobile, has provided free access to educational and health websites for its customers. The pre-selected websites on this service include Schoolgate, MobileClassroom, (in partnership with Federal Ministry of Education) National Open University, KhanAcademy and Seesaw. Others are health-related sites such as Mobihealth, World Health Organisation (WHO), Nigeria Health Watch, HealthLine, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), amongst others.  Executive Director, Regulatory and Corporate Affairs, Abdulrahman Ado, said health and education are two out of the three pillars of the company’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programmes. He said: “The decision to focus on these two areas at this time is borne out of a desire to provide access to health and educational information and services, a critical requirement during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. “As a responsible organisation, we felt the need to support the increasing recourse to online learning by a growing number of academic institutions during this period of lockdown.”
