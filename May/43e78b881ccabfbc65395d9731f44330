The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Ministerial Task team on the Enforcement of COVID-19 restrictions has arrested eight persons, some impersonators of army officers, who violated the curfew. The violators who were arrested at Kubwa and Dutse Alhaji Districts of the FCT would be arraigned at the mobile courts. Some of those arrested were at drinking bars and gardens, while a tricycle operator and a commercial motorcyclist were arrested for operating during the curfew hours. At Second Gate, Dutse-Alhaji, the team accosted the operator of a drinking bar who claimed to be a soldier but upon interrogation he admitted that he lied in order to evade arrest. At Dutse Makaranta, the team shut a pub operating after 10pm. The manager of the place  claimed the facility was owned by a major in the army, saying they decided to operate into the curfew hours because of the occupation of the owner. Addressing journalists after the night operation, chairman of the task team, Ikharo Attah, noted that the compliance level in Kubwa and Dutse area was very high.
