Super Eagles forward Alex Iwobi and his Everton teammates will face title chasing Liverpool on a neutral ground as part of arrangements aimed at ending the coronavirus arrested season. Stakeholders have been working hand in gloves with a view to successfully concluding the season. South Yorkshire Police recommended that games in which Liverpool are involved be played on a neutral ground. The police did not stop there but underlined matches they would like to be played at neutral venues which could include Liverpool matches where the title could be won. Deputy Chief Constable Mark Roberts of South Yorkshire Police, the UK’s football policing lead, said in a statement issued to the PA news agency: “Our discussions with the Premier League throughout this process have been positive, with a shared focus on the priority of public health.  “As such we have reached a consensus that balances the needs of football, while also minimising the demand on policing. “The majority of remaining matches will be played, at home and away as scheduled, with a small number of fixtures taking place at neutral venues, which, contrary to some reports, have yet to be agreed.” Jurgen Klopp’s side need two more wins or one if Manchester City lose their game in hand against Arsenal to reach points total which City would be unable to overtake.
