The Road Transport Employers’ Association of Nigeria (RTEAN) has urged commuters in Lagos to stop boarding overloaded commercial buses. Alhaji Mohammed Musa, Lagos State Chairman of RTEAN, made the plea in Lagos while assessing compliance level of members, a week after the lockdown ease. Musa said commuters could also help in ensuring compliance to the social distancing in public transportation in the state. “We have urged our members to adhere strictly to the Lagos State Government new transport guidelines of carrying only eight in 14-seater commercial buses to forestall the spread of COVID-19. “We have set up task force to ensure compliance among our members but we think commuters also have some roles to play to ensure compliance by avoiding erring operators and reporting any driver flouting government’s directive. “We advise passengers to stop boarding any 14-seater commercial vehicle that has more than eight passengers already in it. Passengers must also support us,’’ the RTEAN boss said. According to him, commuters should stop entering buses once they are loaded up to 60 per cent capacity at parks and bus stops.
