  A POPULAR news blogger and owner of Naijalivetv.com, Mienpamo Saint, has been abducted at his home in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State by hooded gunmen. It was gathered that the incident occurred at about 1:00am on Saturday. The gunmen reportedly whisked the victim to an unknown destination after seizing his phones and those of his relatives. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) spokesperson Asinim Butswat, said he was yet to be briefed on the matter. But the incident has generated uproar among journalists especially social media practitioners, who condemned the development and called for his unconstitutional release. A media rights activist and Convener of Yenagoa Media Forum (YMF), Agidee Theophilus, described the incident as outrageous. He said: “This is another, in a series of calamitous events that have befallen men and women of the besieged fourth estate of the realm in the state. “The Yenagoa Media Forum joins other members of the pen fraternity to condemn the abduction of the media practitioner who in recent times has published scathing reports about key political actors in the Bayelsa State government. “While the painful memory of the unresolved murder of Famous Giobaro is still fresh in our minds, we urged  the Bayelsa State Police Command to do everything within its powers to resolve the matter within the shortest possible time. “Our work as journalists in the state is almost a thankless job while dissenting voices are treated as pariahs. For those who have instigated this shameful act,  let’s be reminded of the very insightful statement by the late US, President John F. Kennedy on  freedom of the press”.
