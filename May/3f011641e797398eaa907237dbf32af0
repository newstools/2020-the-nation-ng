 THE Osun State government has confirmed that the latest COVID-19 case in the state is a medical doctor. Its Jigawa State counterpart on Monday debunked report that some infected medical personnel in the state refused to go into isolation for proper treatment. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), on Sunday, released COVID-19 new cases with Osun State having one. In a statement on Monday in Osogbo, the state capital, by the governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Mr Ismail Omipidan, Health Commissioner Dr Rafiu Isamotu said: “With the new case recorded, it brings to four the number of active cases in the state as at today (Monday, May 11, 2020). “The state, yesterday (Sunday), recorded another case of the COVID-19. He is a medical doctor based in Lagos who came into the state on Saturday to be with his family and suspected he was having the virus on arrival and checked into our isolation centre at Asubiaro rather than going home. His sample was collected and sent for testing. His result came out on Sunday and turned positive. “We are glad that he didn’t have contact with anyone but took the initiative to check himself into our isolation centre immediately he arrived in Osun. That way, the virus was contained.” Also, some medical personnel who tested positive for COVID-19 in Jigawa State have reportedly refused to be admitted into any of the three isolation centres in the state. It was learnt that some of the medical workers, mainly those of the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) in Birninkudu and Rasheed Shekoni Specialist Hospital, last week, tested positive for COVID-19. Contacted on phone on Monday, Health Commissioner and the state Chairman of thje Task Force on COVID-19, Dr. Abba Zakari Umar, confirmed the development. “Yes, some health workers tested positive for COVID-19 in the state. But it is not true that they refused to be admitted into the isolation centre. This is not true.”
