 AFTER 11 days of staying in an Abuja isolation centre, the 253 Nigerians evacuated from the United Kingdom (UK) by the Federal Government were, on Tuesday, subjected to the mandatory COVID-19 test. The test is a critical and perhaps the most important aspect of the 14-day isolation. A negative result sets an individual free to reunite with his family, while testing positive sees the person being relocated to a treatment centre. The Nation reports that at 7:30 a.m, officials of the Nigerian Centre for Decease Control (NCDC) arrived at the centre to begin the test, while the actual testing began at 9:20 a.m. Social distancing was observed during the process. After undergoing his test, one of the returnees, Vincent Uzowulu, expressed satisfaction with the process. “These people are good. I didn’t feel any pain while my sample was taken, though it was a bit discomforting for me,” he said. An elderly man among the returnees, who declined to reveal his identity, said it was a painful process for him when compared to a similar test he did in the UK. “The guy here was just rolling the swab roughly inside my nostrils and throat, and that made it painful for me. The one I did in UK was not painful at all,” he added.
