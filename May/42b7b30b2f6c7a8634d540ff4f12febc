Osun State Chief Judge, Justice Adepele Ojo on Thursday released 13 inmates from Ile-Ife Correctional Centre. She also assured other inmates of accelerated hearing. She said 13 awaiting trial inmates were considered for release out of 19 presented to a committee that evaluated them. “Three out of them were released on health grounds, two granted bail, while others were pardoned because they had overstayed when compared to the number of years of the offence committed.”
