 Former Vice President of Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) Mazi Amanze Uchegbulam has urged sporting authorities  to stop meddling in the day-to-day running of football. Speaking on the second anniversary of the landmark judgement by Justice Peter Olabisi Ige of the Federal Court of Appeal on the alleged  embezzlement of  2010 FIFA World Cup fund, Uchegbulam said his acquittal along with the then NFF President Sani Lulu, Secretary Bolaji Ojo-Oba and late Taiwo Ogunjobi was a triumph of good over evil. “The problem in our own case, had to do with Lulu and the so-called Presidential Task Force (PTF) set up to oversee the 2010 World Cup and they reportedly told then President Good luck Jonathan after our loss to Argentina that we embezzled about 900 Million USD from FIFA,” the former Vice President of Confederation of African Football (CAF) Board of Appeal told NationSport.  “It was clearly untrue and in fact, the NFF was using its sponsorship fund to prosecute the World Cup when the allocation from government was not available even after our third match in South Africa. “Of course, they can’t defend such lies in court and later they alleged undue process in procurement of two Marcoplo buses for the Super Eagles but we showed  in court the approval duly endorsed to the tender board by Dr. Patrick Ekeji who was our chief prosecutor.” Though the court process leading to final acquittal by Justice Ige (on May 8 2018) lasted almost a decade, the Imo State Football Association chairman said he was happy that all the four accused persons were alive to see that justice was well served. “ For instance,  I won’t have been happier today if the late Taiwo Ogunjobi was not alive to see the end of the trial,” he noted.“ I want to use this opportunity, therefore, to remember Ogunjobi and  thank our colleagues and friends who morally supported us throughout the trial.”
