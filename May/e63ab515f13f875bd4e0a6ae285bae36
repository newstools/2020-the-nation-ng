The long arm of the law on Saturday caught Rwanda’s genocide suspect Felicien Kabuga, 25 years after he went on the run. The 84-year old who is accused of funding militias that massacred about 800,000 people, was arrested near Paris by French gendarmes, according to the French justice ministry. He is Rwanda’s most-wanted man with a $5 million U.S. bounty on his head. He had been living under a false identity in a flat in Asnieres-Sur-Seine, the French authorities said. His son-in-law was arrested in Germany in 2007. A top United Nations prosecutor welcomed the arrest. “The arrest of Felicien Kabuga today is a reminder that those responsible for genocide can be brought to account, even 26 years after their crimes,” said Serge Brammertz, chief prosecutor of the Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals in The Hague. The Hutu businessman is believed to have funded the militias that massacred some 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus over a span of 100 days in 1994. The US Department of Justice Archive says Kabuga “has been indicted for genocide, crimes against humanity, and other serious violations of international humanitarian law. “Kabuga is alleged to be the main financier and backer of the political and militia groups that committed the Rwandan genocide. “Kabuga was co-founder and chairman of the Fonds de Défense Nationale (FDN). Through this organization, Kabuga is alleged to have provided funds to the interim Rwandan government for the purposes of executing the 1994 genocide. “Moreover, Kabuga is alleged to have given logistical support to the Interahamwe militiamen by issuing them weapons and uniforms and by providing them transport in his company’s vehicles. “To bring Kabuga to justice, the United States Government is offering a reward to individuals who furnish information leading to his arrest, transfer, or conviction. All information regarding the identity of any informant will be kept strictly confidential.”
