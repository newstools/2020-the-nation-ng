The West African College of Physicians (WACP) has called for establishment of more diagnostic centres and reagents for testing of suspected coronavirus cases. This, it said, will help to fight the virus in the sub-region. The body also commended corporate bodies as well as national governments of sub regions for steps that they have taken to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. “The protection of healthcare workers, need for the development of a common framework for the guidance of further response to the pandemic in the sub region, the need to build on the opportunities offered by the pandemic, and resulting good will, to strengthen the public health capacity and infrastructure in chapter countries,” they said. Dr Albert Akpalu, FWACP Secretary-General, also asked countries to build on the opportunities offered by the pandemic for development of surveillance and research infrastructure and capacity, which are in dire need for effective public health response to outbreaks in the sub region. “There is also a need for national governments to be aware of the ready availability of Chapter Members and Fellows to draw on for national and sub regional services in meeting the medical manpower needs of the response to the pandemic in potential and actual areas of want in countries of the sub region,” he said. He added there was an urgent need for countries to accelerate and expand testing including community testing for a more accurate understanding of the pandemic in the region and providing reliable evidence for the prioritisation of next actions.
