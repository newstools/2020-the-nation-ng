In a circular to its customers on Monday, the terminal said: “We, at Grimaldi and PTML, are mindful of difficulties faced by our customers during the lock down in many states and cities for last four weeks due to COVlD-19 pandemic. “Our national and state governments have started to open the economy since Monday. “Thus, to assist our valued customers with their cash flow, PTML is announcing a special storage waiver palliative with immediate effect as below. “PTML will freeze (stop) storage charges to a maximum of 60 days from the discharge date for all vehicles for next couple of weeks.
