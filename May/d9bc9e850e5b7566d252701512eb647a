NIGERIA’S top wrestler Odunayo Adekuroye has denied granting an interview to a national newspaper on the COVID-19 palliative given out by the ministry of sports. Adekuroye who spoke via telephone conversation said, “I have never granted any interview to the said journalist. This is mischievous, this is unprofessional. I had to put a call through to the said journalist and he was apologetic. Yes, you can apologise but one’s name must have been dragged through the mud. How do you redeem that”?  According to another athlete Enoch Adegoke who also denied granting any interview to the journalist, “This is unacceptable. I never granted any interview. The person just sat down and fabricated stories. This can land him in a lawsuit you know”. The said publication dated 7th May, 2020,on punchng.com, titled, “Athletes grumble over exclusion from ministry’s N50,000 palliative,” alleged that some athletes were excluded from the N50,000 palliative being part of the relief fund to cushion the effect of COVID-19 on Nigerian athletes floated by the Sports Minister Sunday Dare.
