Outgoing President of Chartered Institute of Stockbrokers (CIS), Mr Adedapo Adekoje said his administration recorded several milestones that have placed the institute on a firm path of recovery and growth. In his valedictory speech, Adekoje, who assumed office as the President in April 2018, expressed satisfaction that his administration was able to achieve landmark projects despite the inclement operating environment. He attributed the successes to divine intervention and unflinching support of every member of the institute, urging members to rally round the in-coming administration for sustainable achievements. According to him, the operating environment was, and still is, very challenging for members, as a result of which only about 25 per cent of them were able to pay their annual subscriptions to the institute. On top of this, the general macro-economic situation of the country also meant that getting grants from benevolent institutions became very difficult. He noted that the executives tasked themselves, financially and otherwise; while sacrificing a whole lot of normal privileges to lead the charge from the front, thereby giving inspiration to other members who came out to serve in various committees and others who expressed their supports in various other ways.
