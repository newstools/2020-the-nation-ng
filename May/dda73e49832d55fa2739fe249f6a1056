For the first time, OPPO has added Ultra Night Mode algorithm in the front cameras. As taking selfie at night is a popular scenario for young explorers, Ultra Night Selfie Mode guarantees them to capture the facial clarity and brightness in dim light. Moreover, the Ultra Dark Mode on rear camera makes photo taking in the dark so much easier. When ambient lighting is lower than 1 lux, Ultra Dark Mode will automatically turn on to help you capture the scenes that human eyes could not see. Using NPU, the Ultra Dark Mode realizes AI algorithm acceleration, challenging scenarios such as pubs and streets at night, which will be perfectly captured. Notably, Reno3 Series is another strong proof of OPPO’s consistent endeavor to bring lab technology such as Lossless Zoom to everyday use cases.
