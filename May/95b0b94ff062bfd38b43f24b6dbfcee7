Ekiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi has revealed how his life was shaped by the virtues he learnt as a pupil from the Afenifere leader, Pa Reuben Fasoranti. Dr. Fayemi, in a congratulatory letter to Pa Fasoranti on his 94th birthday, said the life of the Afenifere leader was an inspiration to him and other pupils of Christ’s School, Ado-Ekiti, where the elder statesman served as a head teacher. He described Pa Fasoranti as “not just a dedicated teacher, but also a seasoned school administrator and a moral compass” to the younger generation. The governor, in the letter, which he signed, showered encomiums on Pa Fasoranti, whom he described as a man of “unimpeachable moral conviction.” Fayemi said: “Baba, your life has been an inspiration to many of us who had the rare privilege of passing through our pupillage under your guidance. ”Yours is an epitome of hard work, simplicity, contentment, honesty and strong character. ”I recall with fond memory your lasting impressions on me as our head teacher at Christ’s School, Ado-Ekiti. ”You were not just a dedicated teacher, a seasoned school administrator, but also a moral compass to all of us.” One cannot but be proud of your record of impeccable service to the old Ondo State as the Commissioner for Finance in the administration of Chief Adekunle Ajasin during which you were reputed for your probity, frugality and judicious use of public fund, which partly accounted for the historic successes of the administration. ”It is to be noted that in and out of government and politics, one thing has continued to define your character; and that is, unimpeachable moral conviction.”
