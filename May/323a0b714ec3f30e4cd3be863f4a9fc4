A woman identified as Shade Moke, 41, has been arrested by policemen in Bariga, Lagos for allegedly contracting three men to beat up her maid Halimot, 17. The teenager died from the beating, it was gathered. Also arrested were the suspects John Okpara, Issac Gboyelade and one Akinseye alleged to have committed the offence on February 28. It was gathered that the woman accused the girl of stealing N2,000 she gave her for daily contribution (Ajoo) but the deceased was said to have claimed the money got missing. In anger, the woman allegedly beat up the girl and also allegedly hired the three men to torture her in order to get her to say where the money was. It was gathered that the three hired men “tortured the girl until she collapsed”. On being told on the phone by the contracted men  that the maid had fainted, Moke hurried back from the market and rushed the girl from one health facility to another  before she was confirmed dead at Gbagada General Hospital. She was buried on February 29. It was gathered that Advocates for Children and Vulnerable Persons Network (ACVPN), an NGO, filed a formal complaint at the police division leading to the arrest of the suspects. The woman denied the allegation, insisting that the girl’s parents were duly notified of her death and attended her burial at Atan cemetery. Police spokesman Bala Elkana confirmed the arrest of the suspects, saying that the male suspects “claimed that the girl went into convulsion after drinking water. Commissioner  of Police  Hakeem Odumosu has ordered the transfer of the case to the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (SCIID) Yaba for discreet investigation and diligent prosecution. The suspects will soon be charged to court,” said Elkana.
