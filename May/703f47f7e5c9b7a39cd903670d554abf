  Governor Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa State has asked that people with frail health and the elderly who are 65 years or older should stay at home as part of measures to curb the spread of COVID-19. The governor Â also banned social and religious gatherings but grants that wedding ceremonies and burials can hold provided they will not be attended by more than 15 people. All the foregoing and more are part of the contents of an executive order which the governor signed on Tuesday as guidelines for public conduct in light of a relaxed lockdown which the governor granted with effect from Monday, May 4. The order, made available to newsmen Tuesday evening by Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr Humwashi Wonosikou, backs the resumption of work by Civil Servants on grade level 12 and above while those on lower grade levels are to be divided into two groups for reporting to duty between the hours of 8am and 2 pm on weekdays. The order further stipulates that officers on essential duty are however to carry on with their assigned responsibilities while maintaining safe distancing protocol, wearing face mask at all times, and observing temperature checks and hand sanitizing protocols. The Order also gives legal backing to the indefinite closure of main and cattle markets in Mubi, Ganye, Maiha and other major towns across the state. Tricycle operators are by the order only allowed to carry a maximum of three persons, including the rider, taxis/cars are to carry only four persons at a time including the driver, while Buses/SUVs are to reduce occupants at any time to 50% percent installed capacity. The order says only vehicles conveying goods such as Agro-products, Petroleum products, Medical supplies, Relief and Construction materials as well as Courier and Security services would be allowed entry into the State, but the state government will enforce strictly the ban on interstate travels. The order also says schools across the State would remain closed until further notice, but are encouraged to continue with e-learning and virtual teachings.
