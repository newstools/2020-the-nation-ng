Nicholas Ogunde, Yenagoa The senatorial ambition of the immediate past Governor of Bayelsa State, Mr Seriake Dickson, on Wednesday got a further boost following the endorsement of his aspiration by youths of Ekeremor Local Government Area – one of the two LGAs that make up the zone. Before the recent endorsement by Ekeremor youths, prominent Ijaw leaders, including Asari Dokubo and chieftains of the Ijaw National Congress and the Ijaw Youth Congress have endorsed Dickson as their candidate for the election Bayelsa West seat was vacated by Lawrence Ewruhjakpo when he became Deputy Governor. Rising from a meeting in Ekeremor on Wednesday, the youth leaders said they had consulted widely and critically assessed the credentials and antecedents of everyone jostling to represent Bayelsa West in the Senate and had decided to endorse former Governor Seriake Dickson. In a communiqué signed by 42 leaders, among whom were Morris Eyilade, Livingstone Egbemor, Mike Ebiasuode, Soukeme Bekekeme and Ebikabowei Omoro, they contended that Dickson represented a true and audible voice to push for the interest of the Ijaw in the red chamber. They stated: “We are confident that he (Dickson) will as always be a true and audible voice to push our people’s interest and by extension the Ijaw nation as he is tested and trusted in the House of Representatives. “We, therefore, call on every progressive minds in Sagbama/Ekeremor to support this noble course in our collective interest. “Let us show our appreciation for the Sagbama/Ekeremor road, Bayelsa State Polytechnic, Aleibiri, health and education facilities among many other things he did for our zone when he was governor.”
