 Jose Mourinho says Gareth Bale will “probably” make his second Tottenham debut against West Ham on Sunday. The winger, who rejoined Spurs from Real Madrid on loan last month, arrived back in north London with a knee injury but has been training throughout the international break, with sessions having a “big focus” on the Wales international. Mourinho added that no decision had been made on whether the 31-year-old would start or not, but hinted he would be involved against their London rivals. “We don’t want him to be rushed,” said Mourinho. “We want him to feel comfortable, we want him to make the decision of ‘yes I’m ready, yes I’m ready to go’. “It’s more about that, but he’s working so well. It’s just evolution in every thing, every data and every aspect of his condition. He’s there, he’s there. Probably he plays Sunday, if he doesn’t he will on Thursday, but he’s there, he’s very, very close.”
