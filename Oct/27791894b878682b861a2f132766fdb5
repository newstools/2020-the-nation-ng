JAMES Rodriguez scored a brace as Everton dismantled Brighton 4-2 to go top of the Premier League table. Dominic Calvert-Lewin scored his ninth goal of the season and James Rodriguez netted twice as Everton beat Brighton to make it four Premier League wins from four for the impressive table-topping Toffees. However, it was another game that will prompt questions about the quality of goalkeeper Jordan Pickford for both club and country. All was going well for the home side after Calvert-Lewin rose highest to head in at the back post to cap another excellent week that saw him score his second hat-trick of the season and earn a first call-up to the senior England squad.  But in the closing stages of a first half in which he had barely been tested, England keeper Pickford dropped a tame bouncing ball at the feet of Neal Maupay, who then slotted the ball in on the turn. The heavy rain during the match was undoubtedly a contributing factor but the poor error comes not long after the shocking mistake he made in the Carabao Cup win at Fleetwood. Thankfully for the home side, they were able to reclaim the lead before the break when Rodriguez picked out fellow Colombian Yerry Mina, who headed in following a corner.
