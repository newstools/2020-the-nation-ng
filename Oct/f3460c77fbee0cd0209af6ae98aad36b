 Following the ongoing #ENDSARS protest in the country, particularly in the south-west region, Ondo State Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu(SAN) and his Lagos State counterpart,  Babajide Sanwo-Olu, have rallied their colleague to restore normalcy in the Southwest. Already, governors of Lagos,  Ekiti, Ogun, Ondo, Osun and Oyo have all declared a 24 hour curfew in their respective states as the EndSARS  protests degenerated into riots. Akeredolu, who is also the Chairman of the Southwest Governors’ Forum, have  spoken to his Ogun, Oyo, Ekiti and Osun counterparts, shortly  after Sanwo-Olu declared a 24 hour curfew, following the escalation of conflict in Lagos. Also, Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde had directed security operatives with the tagged name: “Operation Burst” to takeover various hotspots in Ibadan, the state capital, to restore normalcy.  Southwest States have been the epic centres of #Endsars protests in the country. A commissioner in Oyo State, who spoke in confidence, said the deployment of security men was to restore or and not to intimidate the protesters. “You know Akeredolu is the Chairman of Southwest Governors Forum and he is working assiduously to ensure that this protest does not lead to anarchy. So we are also following the advice of the chairman to ensure we restore normalcy as already spearheaded by Lagos. “So, the issue of drafting soldiers to the streets of Ibadan is not intimidate the protesters, but to ensure peace was sustained and we are declaring a 24 hour curfew after our conversation with the Southwest Governors’ Forum chairman.”
