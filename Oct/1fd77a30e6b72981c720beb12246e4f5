Zamfara Governor Bello Matawalle has insisted that scrapped Special Anti-Robbery Squad(SARS) was vital to maintenance of peace in the state. Speaking after arrival from a meeting of Northern Governors in Kaduna, Matawalle urged the Federal Government to deploy the scrapped operatives to Zamfara. He said: “We have recorded tremendous development in the area of peace building the Zamfara date with the commitment and professional contribution and supporf of the FSARS of the Nigeria Police.” He said the unit has helped a lot in bringing down the level of banditry and hooliganism in communities in the state and described the sudden scrapping of the unit as amounting to throwing away the baby along with the dirty water. “I will personally seek audience with Mr President on this issue. We need the FSARS or its equivalent in Zamfara state because we have seen their positive impact in spite their alleged excesses,” Matawalle stressed. The Northern Governors meeting, which was attended by about 12 Governors and seven Deputies, reviewed the ongoing #ENDSARS agitations across the country and called for peaceful protests. The meeting reiterated the indivisibility of Nigeria and said its unity was not negotiable and must be protected by all.
