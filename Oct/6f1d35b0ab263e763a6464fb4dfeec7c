Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq at the weekend announced a donation of N500 million to some owners of businesses looted last Friday by suspected hoodlums in parts of Ilorin, the state capital. The governor, who said it was part of the administration’s efforts to bring them back on their feet, has again condemned “the mindless looting” of people’s businesses in the state capital. He insisted that there could be no justification for such criminal behaviour. He commiserated with owners of the businesses affected. During a visit to the Kwara Mall and Agro Mall on Saturday evening, the governor said the incident may bring businesses to their knees, and cause massive loss of jobs and a surge in poverty rate – implications he said were clearly lost on the “hoodlums”. “We are, therefore, not going to leave the business owners like that. We are setting up a N500 million fund for those that were affected to access. The application form is live and active on the state government’s website and can now be filled by interested parties. We are going to get them back as soon as possible,” he said. He added that claims that government was hoarding palliatives were false as it was not the owner of those materials, AbdulRazaq added, explaining that the food stuffs stolen at the Cargo Terminal were donated to specific vulnerable households and were being distributed across the state for the private sector-led CACOVID Foundation. He added that the ones carted away from Agro-Mall were relief materials donated to specific victims of the recent rainstorms and floods in eight local government areas of the state by the Federal Government. He said the NEMA had already distributed the materials to at least four local governments while consignments for the remaining council areas were due for dispatch when the hoodlums struck.
