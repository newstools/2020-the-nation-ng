 SUPER Eagles coach Gernot Rohr  said he was not unmindful  of the criticisms  that  have trailed his side’s 1-0 to Algeria at the Worthersee Stadion in Klagenfurt, Austria. Defender  Ramy Bensebaini scored the only goal of the match in the sixth minute for the Fennecs while the Super Eagles struggled  throughout  without getting  the desired equalizer. But looking forward to the next friendly tie against  Tunisia tomorrow in Austria, the German coach said it was important to test new players  with the absence of some key players. “When you miss your complete midfield (absence of Wilfred Ndidi, Joe Aribo and Oghenekaro Etebo)  it is necessary to test or to “experiment”,” Rohr said . “Friendly matches are made for that; it will be the last opportunity against Tunisia to do it because the next matches will all be for competition.” Yet  Rohr said he was impressed  with the team’s overall performance  despite the loss to the African champions in a game that  he handed out international debuts to  the quartet of  Frank Onyeka,  Zaidu Sanusi, Kevin Akpoguma and Samson Tijani. “The first positive is that we could play a high level game in good  conditions after such a long time,” noted the 67-year-old  former Bayern Munich defender. “Some players on crucial positions give us satisfaction, goalkeeper, full backs. After a difficult start we came back into the match playing better despite the absence of our best midfielders and goal scorer.
