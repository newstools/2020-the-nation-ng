 THE Nigerian Army has praised the Kogi State Government for its support to fight banditry and other forms of criminality. Commissioner for Information and Communication, Kingsley Fanwo, said in a statement that the commendation followed “the opening up of a road, from Kogi State leading to the notorious Uttu forest, a den of criminal armed bandits terrorising the people of Nasarawa and Kogi states.” He said the Army’s letter of appreciation which was signed by the Acting Director, Army Public Relations, Col. Sagir Musa, was issued on Monday. “Nasarawa State had similarly opened up a road from its side, to access the forest which is located in Toto LG, that borders both Kogi and Nasarawa states, he added. “The Nigerian Army (NA) wishes to appreciate and commend the Kogi State government for heeding its advice conveyed through the Commander, 4 Special Forces Command, Doma, to construct an access road from Kpokpolobi to Uttu Forest. “The opening of the road will no doubt minimise, if not eradicate incessant banditry, kidnapping and armed robbery incidences committed by fleeing terrorists and armed bandits in the general area.
