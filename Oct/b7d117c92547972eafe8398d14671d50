Hundreds of youths on Wednesday marched through Computer village in Ikeja to Force Headquarters, Ikeja to protest alleged brutality and extra-judicial killings by Special Anti-Robbery Squad(SARS) unit. They vowed the protest will continue for the next two days across the economic capital of Nigeria. The youths bore placards with inscriptions such as “Say no to brutal injustice”; “Dreadlocks are no crimes”; “Protect not exploit’ and “Nigeria police stop killing us’ among others. Calling for complete disbandment of SARS, they said in a petition to the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu: “In spite of several reforms announced by the Inspector General of Police, cases of abuse of citizens by operatives of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad have increased without any steps taken by the high command of the Nigeria Police Force to address the fundamental problem of impunity of operatives of SARS. “While we continue to witness the unpleasant consequences of the crime-fighting strategy of the force that promotes extra-judicial and extralegal measures, extortion for self-enrichment and lawlessness, the non-adherence to the prescription of the law poses greater consequences for ordinary citizens who are the victims of the brutality of SARS Squad. “We hereby demand total disbandment of SARS and the identification of cases of extrajudicial execution, torture, and ill-treatment that have caused death or severe injury to be subjected to independent, prompt, impartial, and thorough investigation, and officers reasonably suspected of criminal responsibility be brought to justice. “This must include superior officers who knew or should have known of officials under their command resorting to the unlawful use of force and firearms, if they did not take all measures in their power to prevent, suppress or report such use.”
