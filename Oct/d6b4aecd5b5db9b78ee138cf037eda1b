A Yoruba socio-political cultural group, Osun State Branch of Afenifere, has condemned the attack on Osun State Governor Adegboyega Oyetola by armed thugs after addressing #EndSARS protesters in Osogbo. The group urged the police to bring the perpetrators to book. Also, the Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdulrosheed Akanbi, on Sunday described the attack as barbaric, calling on protesting youths to be law-abiding. A statement jointly signed the leaders of the group in Osogbo, Adeleke Adewoyin and Lekan Usman, which was made available by its Publicity Secretary, Mr. Adebayo Temitope, said: “The protests have been hijacked by the hoodlums. We urged the police to bring the perpetrators to book and plead with protesters to calm down.” In a statement by his Press Secretary, Alli Ibraheem, the Oluwo said: “The attack on Governor Gboyega Oyetola is undeserving and barbaric. In all sincerity, he is a leader by merit. He is a political material that should be encouraged. His intention for Osun is superb. The protesters should avoid impersonation and drive out touts amongst them. If they are to be taken seriously, they should stay focused. I can see derailment.”
