The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Police Command has deployed men to check the vandalisation and looting of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) camp in Kubwa, Abuja. Police Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Mariam Yusuf, said in compliance with the directive of the Inspector General of Police, men had been adequately deployed across the city to maintain law and order. Hoodlums, who have been looting warehouses in Abuja in the past days, on Tuesday morning stormed the camp located in Kubwa where it is believed some palliatives are stored. The situation caused pandemonium in the area. There is also traffic jam across Kubwa as drivers tried to avoid the scene of the incident. Yusuf said: “We are doing our work. We are acting everywhere to forestall possible breakdown (of law and order).”
