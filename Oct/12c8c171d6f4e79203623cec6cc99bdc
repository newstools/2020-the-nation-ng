The former governor lamented over the fatal accident saying, “it was one tragedy too many”, adding that “these young stars and future leaders cut down in their primes is sad and regrettable. My heart goes out to the Governor, parents and guardians of these pupils”.

He urged the government of Enugu State to immortalize the deceased with an educational monument to ensure that they did not die in vain.
