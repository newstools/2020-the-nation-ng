 A 100-LEVEL student of University of Uyo-turned fish seller, Destiny Abraham Nelson, has won the September edition of the Hard Worker competition sponsored by Princewill Trust. Miss Nelson, who said she resorted to selling fish to raise money for her school fees, was presented with a cash price of N100,000 by the founder of a non-governmental organisation (NGO), Princewill Trust, Prince Tonye Princewill. Princewill, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State, said the aim of the trust was to contribute to the economic development of Rivers State by encouraging hard working residents. He advised the winner to make judicious use of the money and inspire others like her to upgrade their businesses too. The “Help the Hard Worker” monthly competition is organised by The Princewill’s Trust for entrepreneurs, youths and other Rivers State residents engaged in micro businesses and all forms of hard work across the state. Princewill said the trust has a special place for the voiceless and encouraged more women, more youths and the disabled to enter the contest. “The more the merrier,” he adde. Miss Nelson said she needed funds to upgrade her business but was helpless. The UNIUYO student said it had always been her dream and desire to work hard to succeed in life. She urged fellow youths in the state to be creative and engage in productive activities.
