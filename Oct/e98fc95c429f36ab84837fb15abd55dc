Officials of the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) have rescued a suicidal man at Lekki who attempted to jump into the lagoon. The incident occurred on Saturday around 10:35pm after motorists sighted the young man and raised the alarm which attracted the attention of LASEMA officials in Lekki. It was gathered that emergency workers, police and motorists managed to talk the unnamed name out of his bid. A source quoted the victim as saying he attempted to take his life because he was tired of life. “He said his lives in Ejigbo and was tired of the hardship. We were able to counsel him to understand that whatever he was going through was a phase,” said the source. Confirming the incident, the Director-General, LASEMA, Dr. Femi Oke-Osanyintolu said he was examined by paramedics and handed over to two Good Samaritans committed to ensuring adequate therapy and psychological counseling for him. Oke-Osanyintolu also confirmed that a woman sustained injuries in a lone accident on the Lekki-Ikoyi Bridge on Sunday morning. He said a vehicle with registration number AAA708GC was found upturned after running into a broken down vehicle on the bridge. He said while the woman was rushed to hospital, the overturned vehicle was evacuated from the road to ensure free flow of vehicular activities
