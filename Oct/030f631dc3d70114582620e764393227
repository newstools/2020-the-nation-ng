The Delta State University, Abraka (DELSU) has honoured  Hon. Ned Nwoko, a member of the House of Representatives from 1999-2003, for his dedication to humanitarian endeavours, education and malaria eradication in Africa. At the event, which held  in Abraka, Delta State, Nwoko, was lauded by the Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Andy Egwunyenga, for his  support for  a multi-million dollar research for the development of an anti-malaria vaccine. The VC noted that the university must be innovative in its approach to solving problems. The awardee expressed gratitude for the honour, noting that he was inspired by such recognitions and pledged that the malaria eradication campaign would succeed. “I believe that malaria is an African problem and it must be addressed by Africans,”he said. Citing  the World Health Organisation (WHO) , the former lawmaker noted  that malaria claims about half a million lives yearly, much higher than the dreaded COVID- 19 could claim in Africa within the same period. He said malaria eradication campaign took him to the Antarctica, which he described as the most difficult part of the world because of the cold weather of the region. He noted that dirty environment encourages the breeding of mosquitoes which are carriers of the disease. He has, therefore, decided to take the campaign further by embarking on a clean Nigeria advocacy, with the value chain that would create about three million jobs.
