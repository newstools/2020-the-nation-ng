Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige has called for peace, unity and understanding amongst Nigerians as the nation celebrates 60th Independence Anniversary. The former Anambra Governor made the call in an Independence anniversary message to Nigerians, titled: Nigeria at 60: “We must imbibe the Spirit of peace, unity and understanding.” In a statement by the Deputy Director, Press and Public Relations, Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment, Charles Akpan, the Minister congratulated President Muhammadu Buhari and all Nigerians “on this remarkable October 1 anniversary.” He appealed to Nigerians to see the 60th Independence Day celebration as an opportunity to bury all their differences and “focus on the things that unite us as a nation.” He urged Nigerians to live in peace as brothers and sisters, irrespective of ethnic and religious differences, understanding one another as citizens of one big, strong and united country. “On behalf of the Ministry of Labour and Employment, I send my felicitations to Nigerians as we mark the 60th anniversary of our existence as a nation. At this auspicious moment, we should be thankful to God for the milestones reached so far. “In spite of all odds, we all are still living together as one nation with a common vision to maintain our enviable position as the giant of Africa and most populous black nation on the earth. “Yes, we have many challenges facing us as a nation today, but they are not insurmountable. For us to overcome, we must engage in nation-building, promote peace and live in unity. There must be an understanding amongst us as a people with a common destiny. “We must bury our differences and focus on the things that unite us as a nation. We must bridge all ethnic cleavages in all its ramifications. It is high time we see ourselves as one people tied together by a common destiny, not as Igbo, Yoruba, Hausa-Fulani, Efik, Ibibio, Kanuri, Kalabari, Ijaw, Tiv, Jukun, to mention but a few,” Ngige said.
