 ALIMOSHO area of Lagos was recently agog with dance, music, comedy, poetry, and art exhibitions as creatives took over the area during the youth carnival tagged D’Gathering. ‘D’Gathering: The Independence Edition,’ organisers says was put together to showcase, celebrate, and connect young people of passion and creativity. According to the convener, Adeojo Oluwaseun the mission is to have a platform where youth are free to express themselves in their own chosen way of life. Oluwaseun who is the CEO of Desoji Arts said the second edition of the exhibition is to celebrate Alimosho and Nigerian Independence. “This year’s edition of the event is to put Egbeda and Alimosho area of Lagos on the world map. We also want to celebrate Alimosho and Nigerian Independence,” the visual artist said. Continuing he said, “Youth should wake up and make things happen rather than wait for things to happen. Youth need to discover greatness in themselves.” While speaking on his passion for art, he said, “Growing up, art has always been part of me. Even while I was in school to study Law at the Houdegbe North America University Republic of Benin, I managed to develop my craft in art and it has been a journey that I have no regret. “A musician has to sing. A comedian has to crack jokes, art is my way of expressing myself. Without moving an inch I can travel all over the universe. It has opened my imagination as you can reach out to the general yet unborn and you can also speak to the future and remind people of what has passed. Art is a way of life.” The exhibition has over 60 artworks of paintings, graphic illustrations, hyper-realistic drawings, and collage from young artists across the states.
