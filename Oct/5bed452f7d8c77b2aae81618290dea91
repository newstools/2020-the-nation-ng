 THE National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) in Anambra State on Wednesday celebrated 12 of its serving corps members who got married in the state. The couples, all of 2019 Batch ‘C’ set, including those redeployed to the state, said they met at the orientation camp. The couples include Eze Obinna and Oluchi Peace, Henry Nwachoko and Charles Ruth, Oluchukwu Davis and Ahedo Etiosa. Others are Nsofor Obianuju and Ohale Nkemakolam, Ogburie Collins and Nwokearu Chinyeremaka, Bernard Faith Amarachi and Okafor Chukwudi. NYSC State Coordinator Kehinde Aremu described the event as unique, saying there had never been an assemblage of marriage in the history of the scheme. He attributed the success story to a conducive environment and the friendly disposition of the people of the state and the government. The Assistant Director, Corps Welfare and Health Services, Mrs. Ify Nwafor, said one of the reasons for establishing the scheme was for integration, including chances for corps members to meet the love of their lives. One of the couples, Onyema Nwachoko, said he met his wife while praying at the Family House of the Christian Corpers Fellowship. He thanked Almighty God and the government for creating the NYSC platform. “Without NYSC, I wouldn’t have met my wife,” Nwachoko said.
