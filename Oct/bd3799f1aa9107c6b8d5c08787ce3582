The 60 sports icons  unveiled by the Ministry of Youth and Sports Development in Abuja last Friday  in celebration of Nigeria’s most outstanding 60 sports persons in the last 60 years have been greeted with mixed feelings. Foremost  journalist  and former chairman of  Vanguard’s  editorial board , Ikeddy Isiguzo, said the list does not represent the true sporting icons in Nigeria with the absence of notable names like Ruth Ogbeifo and Glory Alozie. “Anyone who remembers the stories of Ruth Ogbeifo and Glory Alozie will see how injurious this icon injustice is,” he said. “Ruth possibly could have won the gold but for an injury she was treating months to the games. An NGO, HOPE Worldwide Nigeria, not the NSC, assisted with funds for her medicals. “She lifted 245kg, the same as Colombian Maria Urrutia who won the gold medal because of her lower body weight. Now her medal is treated with indifference. “Glory almost didn’t compete in Sydney after her fiancé Hyginus Anugo died in a car accident in Sydney. She won a silver drenched in tears and sorrow, the medal was an addition to a silver at the 1999 World Championships. She is not an icon?” he asked rhetorically. Another administrator who craved anonymity said if some people’s name could make the list, then it is injustice for some to have missed out. Where’s Osimhen, record scorer at U-17 World Cup and winner? “If  Israel Adesanya is there, why isn’t Anthony Joshua? Why is Adokiye not there and other 1980 AFCON squad members? Where is Amodu? I did not see Victor Ikpeba the crown prince of Monaco on the list, a former African footballer of the year.” “Joseph Yobo who captained the Eagles for over 10 years and recorded over 100 caps as well as Vincent Enyeama, who also recorded over 100 caps was excluded,” he lamented.
