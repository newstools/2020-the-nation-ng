 LEWIS Hamilton equalled Michael Schumacher’s record of 91 Formula One wins yesterday when he guided his Mercedes to a narrow, if measured, victory at a frantic Eifel Grand Prix. Taking full advantage of team-mate and pole-sitter Valtteri Bottas’ early retirement with engine problems, the runaway series leader and six-time champion drove a well-judged race to claim his seventh victory from 11 contests this year. “What a result,” he said on the Mercedes team radio after taking the chequered flag clear of Max Verstappen for Red Bull with Renault’s Daniel Ricciardo in third. In a touching tribute Mick Schumacher presented Hamilton with one of his father’s race helmets. Seeing Michael’s dominance for so long I don’t think anyone especially me could ever think of getting near Michael in terms of records,” said Hamilton.
