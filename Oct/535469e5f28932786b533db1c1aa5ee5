 THE Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC) yesterday expressed optimism that the reappointment of Prof. Mahmood Yabuku as Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) will reinforce the commission’s efforts at conducting more credible elections in the country. In a statement on Wednesday by its spokesman Kola Ologbondiyan, the PDP said: “We consider this reappointment by President Muhammadu Buhari as an impetus to demonstrate a readiness for a free fair and credible election, which Mr. President had always promised to bequeath at the end of his second and final term in office in 2023. “In the light of this five-year extension, our party hopes that the failures, disappointments and miscarriages that characterised the first five-year tenure of Yakubu will have no place in the new order.” IPAC congratulated Yakubu on his re-appointment, urging him to continue with the electoral reforms he initiated. In a statement in Abuja by its National Chairman, Dr. Leonard Nzenwa, IPAC said: “The smooth conduct of Edo and Ondo states’ governorship elections is clear example of the positive technology and digitisation trajectory which Yakubu’s first tenure gave to Nigeria. “We urge him to continue with the strident effort to help in reformation of the electoral process, even as we urge the chairman to put his foot down to ensure that Nigerians votes count in all elections in the country going forward.”
