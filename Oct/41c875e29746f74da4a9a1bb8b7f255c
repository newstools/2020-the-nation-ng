 Project 60:60:60, an initiative designed to engage unemployed youths, has commenced screening of young entrepreneurs in the Southwest. Speaking at the Southwest Project 60:60:60 pre-booth camp screening tagged, ”Investing in the future today”,  the facilitator, Project 60:60:60, Hon. Bimbo Daramola, explained that the initiative was a post COVID-19 national agenda for young entrepreneurs to signpost the attainment of the milestone of 60th Independence anniversary of Nigeria and in line with President Muhammadu Buhari’s vision to engage  unemployed youths. According to him, one of its goals of the scheme is the establishment of 37 entrepreneur labs in each state. “This vision starts this year as part of our 60th year independence anniversary with the selection of 60 young people with workable creative ideas, skills, vision from the six geo-political zones, on the basis of their entries. The successful ones will attend the 60th independence anniversary booth camp and thereafter will be given start-up capitals or business support funds to take off under guided application of the funds and operational supervision,” Daramola said.  According to him, prospective entrepreneurs will pitch business ideas and will be mentored by other established entrepreneurs in the country, they will also be given start-up capital and guidance. He said the decade-long programme is similar to the economic sustainability plan of President Buhari aimed at creating jobs for millions of unemployed youths in the country. One of the assessors, Barrister Winifred Kwentua-Aboderin said the primary objective is to create new 360 entrepreneurs nationwide every year for the next ten years. Kwentua-Aboderin pointed out that the dearth of medium and small scale enterprises was not only caused by paucity of funding but lack of knowledge, coaching and mentorship, which the project is meant to provide.
