The World Development Finance Forum in Germany has accredited Development Bank of Nigeria (DBN) with Sustainable Standards and Certification Initiatives (SSCI). The Sustainability Standards and Certification Initiative (SSCI) is a global initiative for developing and maintaining the first holistic, universally accepted, and an executable set of across-the-board sustainability standards. A statement from DBN said: “The standards are established by consensus among stakeholders and adopted voluntarily by the value-driven financial institutions”. The certificate was received on behalf of DBN by Nigeria’s Ambassador to Germany, Yusuf Maitama Tuggar, represented by Mrs. Mobolaji Sakirat Ogundaro, Deputy Chief of Mission of Nigeria to Germany. Ogundaro, while receiving the certificate, said: “This accreditation demonstrates the level of commitment by the Development Bank of Nigeria in integrating sustainability standards in its operations and also advocating for the adoption of principles of sustainability in the financial ecosystem in Nigeria.” The Bank’s Managing Director, Tony Okpanachi appreciated the World Development Finance Forum for the accreditation, assuring that the DBN will not relent in efforts aimed at deepening its investments in the area of sustainability. He said: “The award shows that we’re doing something right and the international community has acknowledged that. As part of our strategy to deepen the impact on the Nigerian economy, we have equipped our Bank with additional expertise and structures in the area of sustainability”. He added that the DBN recognises “the benefits of acceptance into an elite accreditation forum such as the Sustainability Standards and Certification Initiative (SSCI) and we do not take it for granted.”
