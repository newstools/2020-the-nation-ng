 Super Eagles defender William Troost-Ekong said he was  getting used to the speed of the game in England after making his third appearance for Watford in the English Championship. Troost-Ekong  who featured  in Watford’s 1-1 draw against Bournemouth, hailed Head Coach Vladimir Ivic’s Midas touch  in managing the squad. “I managed to hang on,” he said. “I felt my hamstring a bit; I’m still adjusting to the speed of the game as my last game with my [former] club was the third of August. “I’m still working on my match fitness so I’m happy to get 90 minutes in my legs. The Championship is a different type of football.  It’s more direct and you don’t have so much time with the ball. It’s good quality, from what I’ve seen, and I’m looking forward to the next game,” the Nigerian said. Troost-Ekong took was rock solid at the heart of a back three against Bournemouth with  his stand-out moments being an excellently-timed challenge on Dominic Solanke in the first half and then a muscular one on Josh King in the second. “The coach has made it clear what he expects from us,” said the defender on Hive Live Extra. “That’s the biggest thing. He also talks to the players. People see him as a serious person, but he speaks to the players and he keeps everyone in the loop about what he’s doing. “If you’ve played well and yet are rotated, he gives you the heads up and that helps so there are no surprises. We have lots of competition and everyone is fighting to do well when they get the chance.”
