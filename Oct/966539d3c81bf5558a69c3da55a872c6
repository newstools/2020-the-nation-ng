Nigerian Football Federation (NFF) President, Amaju Pinnick has confirmed FiFA’s approval of Kevin Akpoguma to switch allegiance to Nigeria. The defender was born to a German mother and a Nigerian father and has represented Germany at various youth levels. Akpoguma is, however, still eligible to feature for the Super Eagles since he is yet to play for the European country’s senior team. The centre-back has been delivering consistent performances for Bundesliga side Hoffenheim since joining the club in 2015.  Last season, he made 18 league appearances for the Kraichgauer to help his side finish sixth in the campaign. Ahead of the West Africans’ friendlies against Algeria and Tunisia on October 9 and 13 respectively, Pinnick revealed the 25-year-old has been given the green light to play for Nigeria. “I’m extremely happy to announce that FIFA has just granted Hoffenheim defender and former German U20 national team skipper Kevin Ufuoma Akpoguma permission to make his switch to Nigeria with immediate effect,” Pinnick tweeted. Akpoguma has already linked up with Gernot Rohr’s men in Austria, who are preparing for their games against the Desert Foxes and the Carthage Eagles  and could play a part in Super the  friendlies having been cleared by FIFA.
