Victor Moses scored his first goal for his new club Spartak Moscow on Saturday and remembered his compatriots who are going through tough times in Nigeria. The former Super Eagles star joined the Russian club on loan from Chelsea in October and was making his second appearance on Saturday in a Russian Premier League fixture against FC Krasnodar. Spartak Moscow won 3-1 with Moses scoring their second goal in the 33rd minute. ”Brilliant win today and delighted to get my first goal for the club,” Moses tweeted on Saturday night. ”I dedicate my goal to the people of Nigeria. Enough is enough. Nigerians have the right to protest and not be killed for it. #PrayForNigeria.” The #EndSARS movement has drawn global coverage with high-profile Nigerian entertainers and sports stars joining in the call to disband the notorious Special Anti-Robbery Squad of the police and to thoroughly reform the entire police force. Moses retired from international football after the Russia 2018 World Cup.
