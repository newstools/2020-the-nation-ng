The Lead Organizing Director, AIMS LOC, and Special Assistant to Governor Ben Ayade on Entertainment, Effiom ‘Trombone’ Bassey, said the music summit will educate music artistes. Bassey disclosed to journalists after the tour that the conference, which will be beamed live across various media channels, will only host about 200 guests in the 2, 500 – capacity hall. Speakers and guests will participate remotely from their locations. The initially planned 3-day music summit was supposed to be held in July 2020 at three different locations in Cross River but for the outbreak of the COVID 19 pandemic.
