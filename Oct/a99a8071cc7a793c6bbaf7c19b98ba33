MADRID suffered an early scare with Alvaro Negredo playing against the club where he first broke through almost scored in the second minute. His hooked shot, after a mistake from Toni Kroos, would have crossed the line but Ramos slid in to clear off the line.  Negredo was not the only Cadiz player back on familiar ground. Alex Fernandez was playing at the club where he played as a youngster and, operating on the left wing, he was directly up against his brother Nacho Fernandez, playing right back for Madrid.
