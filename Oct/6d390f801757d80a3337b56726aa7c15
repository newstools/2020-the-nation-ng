Ogolo also noted that the book also covers fashion, culture, sight, and sounds of Nigeria and Africa as well as health tips and some food recommendations saying it’s a holistic book for everyone. In her words, “For me, this book and the magazine at large is my little way of trying to re-orientate Nigerians first of all and then our upcoming generation that you need to understand who you are first of all and what is your value system, what is your relationship with mother earth, how conscious are you of the environment. So, this is my own way of saying you know, Human beings stop, pulse, be respectful of one another and the earth. Secondly, where are you from, everything black is not bad as the western world has painted it so this is me also speaking the African narrative from an African perspective.”
