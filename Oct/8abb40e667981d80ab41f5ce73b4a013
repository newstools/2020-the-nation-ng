 THE Minister of State, Budget and National Planning, Clem Agba has stated that the Federal Government’s effort to mitigate the shocks and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on citizens and the rural economy had reached an advanced stage. Agba  spoke in Lagos at the weekend. It was at the retreat organised by the Federal Steering Committee of the proposed Nigeria COVID-19 Action Recovery and Economic Stimulus (N-CARES). The Chairman, Federal Steering Committee N-CARES, said the implementation instrument of the N-CARES Performance for Result would promote transparency and accountability, adding that the three result areas of the programme have 11 Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs to be used for benchmark achievement. He said the 750 million US dollars loan would benefit states tremendously and complement other economic stimulant programmes of the Federal government. “The Federal Government will use the existing structures of successful World Bank assisted projects, the Community and Social Development Project (CSDP), FADAMA, YESSO and other social investment programmes of government.” Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Otunba Adeniyi Adebayo said the N-CARES programme is a major booster to President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration’s goal of lifting one hundred million Nigerians out of poverty within a decade. He said the ministry would support the implementation of the N-CARES programme. “I will like to mention that the Federal Ministry of Justice, Trade and Investment is well-positioned to ensure the success of this noble initiative especially in the Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) space. The ministry is implementing excellent programmes such as the Nigeria Industrial Revolution Plan (NIRP) and the National Enterprise Development Programme (NEDEP) which can be deployed to support the downtrodden and vulnerable in the society.
