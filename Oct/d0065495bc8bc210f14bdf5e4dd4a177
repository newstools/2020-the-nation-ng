Management of Federal Polytechnic, Mubi, has postponed the reopening of the institution scheduled for Oct. 26 till further notice. This is contained in a statement issued by Medan Ndodi, a Deputy Registrar, and made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Friday in Yola. Ndodi said that the postponement was because of the insecurity posed by the #EndSARS protests. “The commencement of the academic activities is hereby postponed and a new date for resumption will be announced. “The Academic Board of the polytechnic regrets the inconveniences the new decision might have on staff and students,’’ Ndodi said. He said that the decision was necessary to ensure the safety of the students who might likely move from different parts of the country to the polytechnic. (NAN)
