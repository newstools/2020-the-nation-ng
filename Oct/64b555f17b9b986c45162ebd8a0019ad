 AFTER several months of endless wait to be paid their salaries, the Imo State Government yesterday began the disbursement of cheques of four-month salary  arrears to Heartland FC players and officials. The Imo State Commissioner for Youth, Sports and Social Development, Dan Chike Ogu conducted the exercise at the State Secretariat, Owerri with seven players issued cheques for the payment of four months salaries while the remaining players and officials will collect theirs today. One of the Heartland players, Chidiebere Ajoku confirmed the news to our correspondent. “Yes, I can confirm to you that they have started paying us four months out of the debt they are owing us. “It is a big relief because we can’t recount what we had passed through in the last few months, it was only by God’s grace that we are still alive to tell the story.” Heartland players and officials have been in dire strait for several months after the leadership crisis meant debt owed the players and officials continued to accumulate with no recourse to when it would be paid until the Governor of the State, Senator Hope Uzodinma inaugurated a new Interim Management Committee of the club last week.
