 There will be no lack of respect between Pep Guardiola and his old friend and assistant Mikel Arteta when Manchester City hosts Arsenal on Saturday. The pair’s relationship stretches back over two decades, when Guardiola was winding down his playing career at boyhood club Barcelona and Arteta was following in his footsteps and emerging through the youth set-up, before the duo reunited as manager and assistant manager at Manchester City. City cruised to a 3-0 victory in Arteta’s first visit back to the Etihad since being appointed Arsenal manager last December, but he got his revenge with a 2-0 victory in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley in August. Arteta’s Arsenal is in the rather unusual position of leading the big-six clubs in the table right now, despite sitting fourth, with only Everton, Aston Villa and Leicester City ahead. But Pep Guardiola’s side (14th) will want to fix that as soon as possible. The Gunners have won three out of four in the Premier League, losing only to champions Liverpool, while also winning the Community Shield and reaching the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup.’  FIXTURES  ENGLAND Today Everton v Liverpool Chelsea v Southampton Man City v Arsenal Newcastle v  Man Utd Tomorrow Sheffield v Fulham C/Palace v Brighton Tottenham v West Ham Leicester v Aston Villa  GERMANY Today Augsburg v RB Leipzig Freiburg v Werder Bremen Hertha Berlin v  Stuttgart Hoffenheim v  Dortmund Mainz v B Leverkusen Bielefeld v Bayern Mon’bach v Wolfsburg Tomorrow FC Koln  v  Frankfurt Schalke v Union Berlin  ITALY Today Napoli v Atalanta Inter v AC Milan Sampdoria v Lazio Crotone v Juventus Tomorrow Bologna v Sassuolo Spezia v Fiorentina Torino v Cagliari Udinese v Parma Roma v Benevento  SPAIN Today Granada v Sevilla Celta Vigo v A.
