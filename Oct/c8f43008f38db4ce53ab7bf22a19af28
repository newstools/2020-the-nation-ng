 THE gale of defections rocking the All Progressives Congress continued on Friday as more core grassroots leaders and supporters of the party  defected to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)  ahead of the Bayelsa West Senatorial bye elections scheduled for October 31, 2020. Hundreds of APC members from Ward 6 of Sagbama Local Government Area led by Hon Mentor Bob abandoned the APC for the PDP during a major protest rally at the Toru Orua country home of ex-Governor Dickson.

Bernard Kenebai, and other officials of the party.
