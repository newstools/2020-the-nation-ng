Former Minister of Aviation Femi Fani-Kayode has alleged he caught Precious Chikwendu, his estranged wife, with a married man in bed. He stated this while reacting to a viral video claiming that he physically abused Chikwendu. The couple has been reportedly separated over unresolved issues despite having four kids, including a triplet. In the 21-second video, released by Sahara Reporters, the two could be seen engaging in a heated exchange. While reacting in a series of tweets on Saturday, he said the short clip was nothing but a “mere propaganda.” Fani-Kayode said he was only trying to prevent her from filming him during the face-off which happened days after he caught her engaging in the alleged unholy act. He tweeted, “@SaharaReporters posted a video which supposedly depicts me abusing my estranged wife. This is nothing but a propaganda video, “There was no physical abuse. I simply took the phone from her to stop her from recording me after catching her in bed with a married man days earlier. “I repeat there was no physical abuse whatsoever and she had been insulting and subjecting everybody, including family members, staff and children, to physical and verbal abuse the whole day. As usual, it was a nightmare!”  “My words in the video are self-explanatory. I urge those that watched it to listen to those words carefully. I told her that everyone wanted peace except for her and all she did was indulge in scandal after scandal. I have never physically abused my estranged wife,” he added.
