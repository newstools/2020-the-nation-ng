 Nigeria  international Aruna Quadri  was yet the cynosure of all eyes  on Sunday as  he inspired TTC RhönSprudel Fulda-Maberzell second win in the Table Tennis Bundesliga (TTBL) against champions FC Saarbrücken. It was a great relief for TTC against the star-studded Saarbrücken as they recovered from the initial  2-0  loss to  a remarkable 3-2 win in the energy-sapping match. TTC lost the opening two matches after both Ruwen Filus and Fan Bo Meng both fell respectively to Patrick Franziska  and Shang Kun.But Quadri started his side’s revival  when he dismissed Darko Jorgic 3- 0 (11- 5, 11- 9, 11- 2)  and this seemingly motivated Filus to record his first league win as the German international played his heart out against Shang Kun with a convincing 3-1 (11- 8, 11- 5, 8-11, 11- 7) win to put the tie at 2-2. The hope of TTC now rests on the shoulders of thereafter, Quadri and Meng  partnered in the deciding doubles match against Franziska and Jorgic  and stunned the visitors 3-0 (11-5, 15-13, 11- 7) to the admiration of the home fans.  Quipped TTC’s  president Stefan Frauenholz: “Quadri Aruna initiated the turnaround in the third duel of the day, the 3-0 win over Darko Jorgic a clear sign of the qualities that lie dormant in the Nigerian. Especially in the first (11: 5) and third set (11: 2). “ Aruna didn’t give Jorgic a chance and was able to go into the doubles with Meng with confidence,”  stated Frauenholz . “When you win against the reigning German champions, that’s something special.” TTC will now  go into a relaxed five-week break, with the home game against TTC OE Bad Homburg on November 27th.
