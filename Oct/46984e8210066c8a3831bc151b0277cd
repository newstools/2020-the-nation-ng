Juventus vice president Pavel Nedved has revealed he is looking forward to seeing Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi face each other in the Champions League, and insists the pair are “still the best in the world”. “It’ll be a huge clash with Barcelona and a fascinating encounter, because it allows what in my view are still today the two best players in the world – Ronaldo and Messi – to face off against each other,” vice-president Nedved told the club’s official website. “Along with that, we are also seeing Miralem Pjanic and Arthur meeting, so that is another match within the match.” Meanwhile, beaten 2020 finalists Paris Saint-Germain will have a chance for revenge against Manchester United, who ousted the French club in the last 16 two seasons ago.  PSG will also come up against RB Leipzig in Group H. The sides met in last season’s semi-finals in Lisbon in August, with Paris winning 3-0 before losing to Bayern Munich in their first ever final appearance. English Premier League champions Liverpool, who won the Champions League in 2019, will face Ajax as well as Atalanta in Group D. Holders Bayern will face Atletico Madrid and will also have a short trip across the border to Austria to take on Salzburg in Group A. The group stage starts on October 20, and all six rounds of games will be crammed into eight weeks in a schedule that is even more packed than usual because of the coronavirus pandemic.
