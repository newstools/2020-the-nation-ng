The Police Service Commission (PSC) said it would soon meet to decide the fate of the ongoing recruitment of constables invalidated by a judgement of the Court of Appeal last Wednesday. Its Head, Press and Public Relations of the Commission, Ikechukwu Ani, the commission was getting calls from people that took part in the 2019 recruitment and others currently taking part in this year’s exercise to know their fate. He said a way forward would be taken at the meeting when it holds. The Commission described the judgment as a victory for the rule of law, adding that they will continue to work with the Nigeria Police for the collective good of the nation. The statement reads: “The Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja on Wednesday, September 30th 2020, returned the Constitutional powers of the Police Service Commission to appoint persons into the Nigeria Police Force, setting aside an earlier Federal High Court ruling to the contrary. “The Commission sees the judgment as victory for the rule of law and has always believed in the supremacy of the law. The Commission is happy with the judgment and will continue to work with the Nigeria Police Force for the collective good of the nation. “Meanwhile the Commission has continued to receive several calls on the fate of the 2019 and the on-going 2020 recruitment into the Constable cadre of the Nigeria Police Force already declared null and void by the judgment. “The Commission will soon meet to take a decision on the implications of the judgment and the way forward. It will continue to ensure that its operations are guided by established laws.”
