A vigilante has strangled the attendant of a POS shop in Adamawa and stolen the valuables, including the POS machine and cash received from customers. The vigilante, 28-year-old Nuhu Dauda, allegedly strangled the attendant, 12-year-old Jemima Reuben at the POS shop in New Badirisa, a growing community in Girei local government area. Dauda, who is said to be a regular customer at the POS shop, allegedly carried out the crime on Saturday. Our correspondent gathered the suspect went to the shop, strangled the female attendant, and took all the available money and the POS machine. Confirming the incident, the Adamawa State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Sulaiman Nguroje, said the suspect had been arrested and the investigation started. He said he could confirm already that the suspect is a member of a vigilante group operating in Badirisa. “The victim’s family members are helping the police with useful information for a wider investigation,” Nguroje said. The late Reuben, it has been established, is a student of First Baptist Academy, Yola. She had been preparing to resume school on Monday, October 12 when all schools in Adamawa State are scheduled to reopen after the COVID-19 lockdown. Girei, a town and local government area bordering Yola North, the heart of Adamawa State capital, is home to vital institutions, including the Modibbo Adama University of Technology (MAUTECH). The area is increasingly becoming a hotbed of crime, with kidnapping, rape, and armed robbery quite rampant.
