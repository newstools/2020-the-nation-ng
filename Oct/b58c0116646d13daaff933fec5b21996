Police in Kano have taken a woman into custody for allegedly killing her two children. Hauwa’u Habibu, 26, attacked her son Irfan, six, and daughter, Zuhura, three, with a machete and pestle, police said. Habibu, who lives in Diso Quarters in Gwale Local Government Area of the state, was said to have confessed to the crime. The suspect also severely wounded her 10-year-old nephew before fleeing the house, police told The Nation on Sunday.

Police spokesman, Abdullahi Haruna, in a statement said a team of detectives rushed to the scene and took the victims to Murtala Mohammed Specialist Hospital Kano, where a medical doctor confirmed them dead. Aisha Sadiq, the suspect’s nephew, survived the attack and was transferred to Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, where she was treated and discharged. The survivor said she heard the suspect threatening to kill the children and the newly married wife.
