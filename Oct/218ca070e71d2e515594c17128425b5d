Daughters of President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo have thrown their weights to the growing #EndSARS campaign. Zahra Buhari-Indimi posted a clenched fist on her Instagram status with the #EndPoliceBrutality hashtag.  Osinbajo’s daughter, Kiki Osinbajo, posted the same photo on Instagram with the caption: “Police Brutality Must End Now… #EndPoliceBrutality #EndSARS.”  Thousands of youths have since Wednesday taken to the streets in protest against alleged harassment and extrajudicial killing of #SARS operatives.
