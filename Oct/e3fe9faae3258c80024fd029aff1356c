 THE Coalition for a Better Nigeria has warned anarchists hiding under the guise of #EndSARS protests not to plunge the country into anarchy. In a statement by its National Coordinator, Comrade Awa Bamiji, the sociopolitical group said although peaceful protests is a part of democracy, it must not be allowed to cause civil unrest. He said: “Peaceful protests is an integral part of democracy, and that is why the Federal and State Governments in the last 12 days have treated the protesters in a civilised manner. But we must be cognizant of the fact that it has taken a different dimension and has been hijacked by hoodlums and people with ulterior motive. “With the latest attacks on the convoys of the two sitting governors-Gboyega Oyetola and Kayode Fayemi of Osun State and Ekiti States respectively; attack on the Palace of Soun of Ogbomoso, Oba Jimoh Oyewumi, Ajagungbade III; attack on the public and private facilities; killing of Mr Yohanna Shankuku, the driver of the Honourable Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Barrister Festus Keyamo (SAN); blocking Governor Udom Gabriel Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom State till he smartly escaped the mob action with Okada man while his security aides guided him on both sides; killings of protesters in Ogun, Ondo, Osun, Lagos, Edo and other parts of the country by unknown and yet to be identified gunmen or through road accidents. We saw a viral video that showed some hoodlums walking naked in public procession among the genuine protesters, it is obvious that the original conveners of the protests, who might have meant well are no longer in control of this volatile situation that can lead to anarchy, if government does not take firm and urgent steps to protect the lives and livelihood of innocent Nigerians.”
