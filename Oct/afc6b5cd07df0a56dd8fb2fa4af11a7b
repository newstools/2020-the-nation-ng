 ACCESS to financial services and mortgage finance have been growing rapidly in many advanced economies. However, many developing economies  like Nigeria have witnessed poor access to mortgage loans and easy funding plans, especially by the low income earners. To address this challenge, Adron Homes has offered 40 per cent discount to its customers who are interested in investing in  its properties. The company says it is offering up to 40 per cent off land and properties and taht customers can subscribe to any of its products with initial deposits as low as N25,000. The promotion, it said, was line with its commitment to empower Nigerians and provide them with decent and affordable housing solution. Its Group Managing Director, Adetola Emmanuel King, stressed the importance of building the nation right and living in peaceful communities just as the company guarantees in all of its estates. “During this critical period, when everyone across the nation, is striving to survive the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, this serves as our own way of celebrating the achievements of this great country, while concurrently empowering young and ambitious Nigerians by making the incredible affordable to  Nigerians across board,” he said.
