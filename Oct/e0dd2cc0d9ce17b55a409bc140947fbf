SEBASTIAN Osigwe, a newly invited Super Eagles goalkeeper, has tested positive for the novel coronavirus. FC Lugano of Switzerland confirmed Osigwe’s COVID-19 status in a statement on their official website. The 26-year-old was named in Gernot Rohr’s 24-man list for Sierra Leone’s two-legged qualification games for the 2022 Africa Cup Nations (AFCON) on Thursday. In the statement, the club said seven other of its players also tested positive for coronavirus. “The management of FC Lugano announces that the tests carried out following the positivity of Mattia Bottani also highlighted the positivity of the goalkeeper Sebastian Osigwe,” the statement read.  “Following the above and the reconstruction of the contacts at risk, the cantonal doctor has also decided to quarantine Jens Odgaard, Jonathan Sabbatini, Noam Baumann and Marcis Oss, and this despite full compliance with the “COVID-19” protection concept of the SFL for training and matches. “In addition, two other players (Noah De Queiroz and David Jovanovic), aggregated to the first team but who took part in last weekend’s match of Team Ticino U21 have also been quarantined.” Osigwe is expected to self-isolate for ten days after which another test will be carried out on him to ascertain his state of health.
