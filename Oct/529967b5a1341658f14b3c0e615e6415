  SIFAX Group has opened a new container terminal in Lagos as response to the difficulties experienced by stakeholders in accessing Lagos ports. Speaking at the inauguration of the facility situated along the Ebute Metta Creek, Ijora, Lagos, its  Group Executive Vice Chairman, Dr. Taiwo Afolabi, said the company decided to invest in the facility to make the process of cargo clearing a wonderful experience as opposed to what is obtainable currently. Represented by Group Managing Director, Mr. Adekunle Oyinloye, he said the new terminal, which would be a model and sits on an 11 acres of land, will leverage on technology and innovations to deliver an unparalleled customer experience as well as cutting-edge inland container services. He said: “The SIFAX Container Terminal, Ijora, Lagos is our modest response to a major issue in the maritime industry – access to Lagos ports.” He said the logistics nightmare in Apapa occasioned by the traffic congestion experienced by port users compelled the group to look for a solution that addresses thus seemingly intractable problem. “With this terminal, agents, truckers and consignees don’t have to go to the ports before getting their consignments cleared,” he said.
