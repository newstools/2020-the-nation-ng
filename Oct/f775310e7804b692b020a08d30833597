Ahead of the Bayelsa West Senatorial by-election, kinsmen of former Deputy Governor and All Progressives Congress(APC) candidate, Chief Peremobowei Ebebi, have reaffirmed support for Chief Seriake Dickson, the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party. Former Governor Seriake Dickson is from Sagbama Local Government Area of the district while his major contender, Ebebi, is from Ekeremor LGA. In a statement on Friday by leader of Concerned Youths of Ekeremor LGA, Comrade Kennedy Olorogun, the people said Dickson is the best thing that has happened to Bayelsa West since the creation of the State. Olorogun reiterated in the political history of Sagbama and Ekeremor, no one had done a quarter of what Dickson had done for them, ranging from unprecedented infrastructural development and youths engagement in strategic positions of governance. Olorogun, who is the immediate past Chairman of the Ijaw Youth Council, Central Zone, further acknowledged the confidence, dexterity and intellectual capacity of Dickson. He said: “Ex-Governor Seriake Dickson is an experienced, tested and trusted leader, hence our choice of him to epresent us at the red hallowed chamber of the National Assembly. “His representation will have direct positive impact on Bayelsa State and Ijaw nation at large.” He said Ebebi should, as a humble leader, adhere strictly to his earlier echoes of zoning formula, adding the former Speaker was one of those that flauted the gentleman zoning agreement between the two LGAs. Olorogun also argued the APC had goofed by picking their senatorial candidate from Ekeremor when they already have a serving House of Representative member in person of Mr Fredrick Agbedi. He said for fairness and equal opportunities, Sagbama is to produce the Senator for the district this time in conformity with the alleged resolved zoning formula.
