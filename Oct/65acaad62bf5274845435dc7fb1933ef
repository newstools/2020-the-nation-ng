 NOLLYWOOD veteran, Akin Lewis, revealed his professional bond with leading actresses like Joke Silva, Shaffy Bello, Jaiyte Kuti as mutual respect and art connection. In an interview, Lewis revealed that these actresses already know their onions in the industry, hence, they step up to match his brilliance anytime they are paired on the same set as a couple. “I have a kind of bond with some women in the film industry and that is because they are good. I am easily the best in my class and I am good if I have to say it myself. So, if you work with me, any of these ladies, they step up. The chemistry is just there, I have that kind of connection, Joke Silva, Jaiye Kuti, Omotola Jalade and even Funke Akindele-Bello.”  On his plan to retire after serenading fans for almost five decades, Lewis says he doesn’t see himself retire as long as he has the grace of good health and strength. “I have been acting for like 47 years and I see another 20 something years. Actually, you never retire, God gives me the strength and the grace, I will keep going till I no longer can,” he says.
