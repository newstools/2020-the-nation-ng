She said this was another moment to celebrate their customers. “We will always celebrate you. You are the reason why we are in business. We seize the opportunity of this event to re-affirming our commitment to providing excellence in customer experience in all our interactions with you. The theme reflects the importance of teamwork in consistently providing outstanding service at all our touch points. This is what we represent in Ecobank. Your dream team celebrates you.

They included digital promo where customers doubled their recharge by buying airtime via the mobile app or USSD code between 5pm and 6pm; appreciated a back office colleague, team or department who  displayed exceptional customer service attributes; standard greetings by staff members and security personnel at the bank’s locations to customers.
