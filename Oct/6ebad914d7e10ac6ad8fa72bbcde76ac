Business and social activities in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja were almost grounded to a halt on Sunday as the #ENDSARS protests heated up in the nationâ€™s capital. The protesters in their numbers blocked major roads in Abuja, causing massive gridlocks across the city and forcing many to wrongly drive against their lanes as they frantically looked for routes to be on their way. The protesters blocked major areas including Banex, Wuse Market, Kubwa Expressway, Gudu Junction. The city was almost like a ghost town as many people who were not part of the protests rather suspended activities they had to attend to for the day. A group of the protesters on Sunday held Church Service on the road in front of the Ministry of Finance headquarters. The protesters in their numbers who left various locations in the city were to converge in the central area of Abuja, where the Force Headquarters is located. Meanwhile, it was observed that dozens of well- armed policemen had been deployed around the police headquarters, as major surrounding roads were cordoned off. Many residents on Friday kept vigil at the Airport Road in Abuja to push home their demands. The protesters, who had been there since morning, caused traffic gridlocks that stretched for kilometres.
