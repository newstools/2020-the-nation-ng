Two women have been inflicted with severe skin burns in separate kerosene explosions in Abakaliki, Ebonyi. The incident, which involved 70- year-old Mrs. Elizabeth Igwe and 21- year-old Chinenye Ezekwenna, has thrown residents into apprehension over the possibility of adulterated kerosene in circulation in the state. Igwe resides at 3 Jemeni Street in the capital city while Ezekwenna resides at 40 Jemeni Street. Narrating her ordeal, Elizabeth said the kerosene exploded when she was refilling her hurricane lamp in the night. According to her, the suspected adulterated kerosene was purchased by a little boy from a roadside vendor. Ezekwenna said the kerosene exploded when she poured it on smouldering firewood as she was cooking. The victim, who said she suffered burn on her legs, arm, and jaw, explained that she purchased the suspected adulterated kerosene from a retail shop. Ezekwanna was seen using ordinary water to clean the severe burn on her body while the septuagenarian victim said she had been treated at a hospital and managed by a nurse at home. The Special Assistant to Ebonyi Governor on Petroleum, Bassey Chima, promised to get back to our correspondent when contacted. He however failed to do so at press time despite several reminders.
