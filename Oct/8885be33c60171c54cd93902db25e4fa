About 20 fire incidents have so far been recorded in the private and public sector this year, the Federal Government, has said. The government blamed the large numbers of causalities recorded from fire outbreaks to panic, fear, stampede, smoke inhalation than the inferno itself. Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Umar Farouq, disclosed this in Abuja at an event to mark the 2020 International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction. She said: “In 2020 alone we have witnessed more than 20 fire incidents in both public and private buildings. Experience and research have shown that panic, stampede, and smoke inhalation rather the burns from the fire have been responsible for the loss of life in the major fire disaster history.” The minister assured Nigerians that the government would continue to champion campaigns against fire disaster reduction across the country. She explained that the theme for this year which is ‘Disaster Risk Governance’, “is a reflection of the Ministry’s focus on strengthening the existing strategies for disaster risk reduction and to facilitate the development of new ones where there are gaps in line with international best practices as contained in the Sendai the Disaster Risk Reduction in 2015.” On his part, Assistant Controller of Fire Service, Samson Karebo, urged Nigerians to be careful when burning bushes, especially during the dry season. Karebo said the Federal Government would continue to collaborate with state governments to minimise fire disasters in the country.
