President of the World Confederation of Productivity Science (WCPS), Mike Dillon, has stressed the need for stakeholders in the productivity space in Nigeria and across the continent to sustain the drive towards  improved productivity. He spoke recently at the first ever virtual graduation of the Institute of Productivity and Business Innovation Management (IPBIM). Dillon proposed a collaborative platform where Africa can discuss the way forward and work relentlessly on  improved productivity with Nigeria  at the forefront. He said: “In as much as there is a future for the continent, Africa is almost known as the sleeping giant and there is need for stakeholders in the productivity space across the continent to work to improve her productivity. There should be a collaborative platform where Africa can discuss the way forward for her productivity and Nigeria can champion this cause. Thus, the National Productivity Center Abuja, should collaborate with the IPBIM to make such a reality as the WCPS will support such initiative.” President of the institute, Mr Remi Dairo, while congratulating the graduands, said the institute is poised to raise practitioners in the productivity and innovation ecosystem in Nigeria. He said the institute will not relent in her efforts to produce more change agents that will transform the continent of Africa starting from Nigeria. He therefore urged the federal government to create an enabling environment for private bodies who drive the reality of productivity and innovative enterprise among Nigerians.
