The NECCI Public Relations will be holding its annual conference on Thursday, October 29, 2020 at the prestigious Eko Hotel & Suites, Lagos. This year marks the 20th edition and due to the ongoing social distancing, the event will be held both physically and live-streamed across various digital platforms. The theme of this 20th edition is ‘RAISING THE VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDING CLARION – The Role of Public Relations in Growing the Enterprise Base through Venture Capital Funding.” According to the Convener Nkechi Ali-Balogun, Principal Consultant/CEO, the theme will expand the new frontier of enterprise development through venture capital funding, especially with a focus on the part of Nigeria’s demography that has the least access to funding from the capital market, namely women and youth. “The NECCI PR Roundtable, a not-for-profit event, designed to foster global competence using strategic communication has evolved over the years to become an epoch event where communicators deliberate on topical issues to bring about a paradigm shift in governance and economic reforms.”
