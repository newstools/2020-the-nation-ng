Suspected hoodlums have looted the Agricultural Development Project (ADP) fertiliser warehouse in Kogi State. The hoodlums were said to have overpowered the security-men attached to the warehouse in the Felele area, Lokoja, carting away unspecified bags of fertilisers. Commissioner for Information and Communication, Kingsley Fanwo, in a statement on Monday attributed the development to the handiwork of armed robbers, who according to him, brandished “dangerous weapons” to overpower the security-men on duty.” He however said that some of the looters have been arrested and were making useful statements to the police. “They stole bags of fertilisers and agrochemicals, dangling dangerous weapons to scare the security operatives on duty at the ADP. “This is considered an attack on the economy of the state as Government has positioned agriculture to drive the state out of the global economic gloom. He added: “The ever gallant security operatives in the state swiftly moved to the scene of the crime to ensure prompt arrest of the robbers and recovered all the stolen fertilizers and agrochemicals belonging to the Kogi farmers. “The fertilisers in the warehouse were reserved for dry season farming across the Confluence state.” He said those arrested were already making confessional statements at the police station, while others who fled the scene, leaving their tricycles already loaded with fertilisers, are being trailed by security agencies.
