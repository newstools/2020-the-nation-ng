Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has lifted the sanction imposed on Mali following the removal of President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita in August. ECOWAS, in a statement, said: “Heads of state and government have decided to lift sanctions” in order to “support” the handover to civilian rule. “It noted the publication of a transition roadmap and the status alloted to the military leader in the interim government.”
