Barring any unforeseen hitches, all schools – private and public – in Nigeria are expected to reopen from October 12. Announcing this last Friday, the Federal Government said the decision to reopen schools, which have been closed since March, was taken after consultations with stakeholders, including the Presidential Task Force on Covid-19. At a news conference in Abuja, Education Minister Adamu Adamu said pupils of all classes should start returning to schools nationwide. Even without mentioning it, it was obvious that stakeholders must have been encouraged by lowering figures in new cases of Covid-19 and high rates of recoveries in the country lately. Throughout last week (from Sunday, September 27 to Saturday, October 3), 1,089 new cases, 996 recoveries, and seven deaths were recorded in Nigeria.
