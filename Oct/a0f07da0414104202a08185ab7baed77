 KADUNA State Governor Nasir El-Rufai has attributed the growing momentum for peace in Southern Kaduna, to the peace-building initiatives of groups like the Southern Kaduna Peace Summit. El Rufai also praised the Executive Secretary of the Nigerian Christian Pilgrims Commission (NCPC), Rev. Yakubu Pam, the Agwatyap HRH Dominic Gambo Yahaya and community leaders from the area, for complementing security efforts with an ongoing peace process. This was as Governor El-Rufai while welcoming the progress made so far to restore peace in the area, said the fact that violence which had lingered in the area for decades, makes it urgent to put conflict entrepreneurs out of work and widen the constituency for enduring peace. The governor, who made this known when members of the Southern Kaduna Peace Summit submitted their report to him on Wednesday, thanked them for investing their time and resources to peace-building.
