Hundreds of traders, artisans and students on Wednesday trooped out on Ondo town streets to woo voters for the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu. The walk, led by the Special Adviser to Minister of Interior Rauf Aregbesola, Mr. Bola Ilori, took off from the APC secretariat in Ondo town. Campaign fliers were distributed to motorists, passers-by and shop owners. Youths engaged drivers on the need to come out en masse and vote for the APC. Akeredoluâ€™s running mate, Mr. Lucky Aiyedatiwa, addressing the crowd, thanked them for supporting Aketi/datiwa movement. He urged them to mobilise their relatives and friends to their polling units to secure majority votes. Aiyedatiwa told the supporters that elections are won at the polling units and not collation centres. He enjoined people to defend their votes by waiting for the votes to be counted and results uploaded.
