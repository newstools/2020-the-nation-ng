Hoodlums suspected to be members of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) yesterday launched an attack on the Central Police Station in Abakaliki, the Ebonyi State capital.. The station is located along the Abakaliki-Enugu Highway  close to the International Market. The hoodlums also set ablaze cars, tricycles and motorcycles at the station. IPOB leader Nnamdi Kanu had called on his members to embark on a cleanup exercise protest in major cities in the Southeast and Southsouth zones Tuesday. The exercise, was peaceful in Ikwo Local Government Area, where security agencies allowed them to move around without any confrontation. But in Abakaliki, the proscribed group members, who clearly identified themselves as members of the group, launched an attack on the police station around 3pm. They claimed that some of their members were killed by the police during last week’s disturbances in front of the station. The Nation could not independently verify their claims. As reports of the incident filtered in, residents ran back to their houses for fear of being caught in crossfire. Many shops and businesses closed down abruptly. The governor, David Umahi left a function at Old Government House and returned to the New government as reports of the incident got to him. Police Commissioner in the state, Philip Maku confirmed the attack on the station. He said no casualty was recorded. The CP also vehemently denied that any of the attackers was killed in last week’s clashes. He instead said that it was the Police who later lost one of its Police Officers who was injured during last week’s disturbances. “We are the ones being brutalised. One of the two Policemen that were wounded last week later died,” he said. IPOB spokesman Emma Powerful said the attackers are not members of the secessionist group.
