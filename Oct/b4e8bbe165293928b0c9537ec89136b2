 Lorient Chairman Loïc Fery has said that he doesn’t think he took a risk signing Terem Moffi, adding that he believes in the potential of the Nigerian. Moffi, who cost Lorient a record eight million Euros from Belgian club KV Kortrijk, is expected to make his Ligue 1 debut for FC Lorient at Stade Reims tomorrow and help the North France side move up the table where they are currently lying in 17th place with four points from six matches. The 21-year-old joined Kortrijk in a $150,000; three and a half year deal in January from Lithuanian first division side FK Riteriai and scored five goals in nine league matches before football in Belgium was cancelled due to coronavirus pandemic.  He was recently named in the Belgian club’s Team of the Season despite being in the club for only two months. Moffi was on for an hour in Lorient’s 2-0 away loss to league leaders Rennes in a club friendly game last weekend. “Terem Moffi is a very powerful and effective striker who we have been following for a long time,” Fery told. “We believe a lot in his potential, and it is not just a bet on the future that FC Lorient made by recruiting him, but he will have to adapt to Ligue 1”
