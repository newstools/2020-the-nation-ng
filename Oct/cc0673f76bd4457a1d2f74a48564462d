The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has shared N2.495,241,552.54 billion to the six Area Councils in the FCT and other stakeholders as its share of statutory allocation for September. Of this figure, N867,586,819.11 was made available for distribution to the six councils, while N1, 627, 654, 733.43, was made available for other stakeholders, bringing the total to N2.495,241,552.54 billion. Minister of State, Dr Ramatu Aliyu, urged members of FCT Joint Area Councils Allocation Committee (JAAC), to make disbursed figures public for accountability and transparency in governance. Dr Aliyu, who made the call at the 146th JAAC meeting, also stated that such move to make public the figures distributed to the six Area Councils at the end of every JAAC meeting, would not only promote transparency but also douse the tension and suspicion among residents of the territory. The figure also shows that Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), received N194,908,566.24 million, while Gwagwalada got N183,615,439.22 million and Kuje received N115,354,553.64 million. Similarly, Bwari Area Council received N117,260,424.14 million, Abaji got N136, 062, 102.45 million and Kwali received N120,385,733.42 million. A statement by her Special Assistant Media, Austine Elemue, yesterday, maintained it was the obligation of government at all levels to explain how funds were being disbursed and expended in line with the agenda of President Muhammadu Buhariâ€™s administration. She stated that it has been the tradition of the Federal Government to publish all funds allocated to states and local governments, adding that the FCT Administration would not deviate from such exemplary leadership set by the federal government.
