The Southern Africa region is the most COVID-19 affected region both in terms of the number of confirmed positive cases and the number of deaths, it was noted. The Northern Africa region is the second most COVID-19-affected African region. So far, only three African countries have confirmed COVID-19 cases in excess of 100,000.
