 FIFA match agent and stadiums facility expert, Ebi Egbe said  there is nothing to worry over Super Eagles Friday’s  1-0  loss to African champions Algeria in Austria. The CEO of leading stadium construction outfit, Monimichelle Group, said international friendlies are played ostensibly to make a team see her weaknesses and how to work on them. He noted that the game against Algeria would definitely have given Rohr an insight into what to do ahead of the AFCON and World Cup qualifiers, even as he said coming hard on the team would make the players lose confidence in themselves. “We need to encourage the team and this is not the time to write them off as it would not help us,” explained Egbe.“ Rohr and his boys need the support and encouragement of Nigerians. “The NFF has on its part done well by putting quality friendlies together for Rohr to test out new players. I’m m happy the era when Nigeria was not part of the action during FIFA international break is gone.” Egbe further said  he was   confident Nigerians would see the real Super Eagles when Nigeria faces Sierra Leone next month in the home and away AFCON qualifiers. Meanwhile, the Super Eagles are billed to take on Tunisia tomorrow  in another friendly during this 10-day FIFA approved international break.
