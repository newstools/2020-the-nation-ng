 FRANK Onyeka has been listed as doubtful for FC Midtjylland UEFA Champions League Group D clash at home against Atalanta tomorrow, according to uefa.com. Reasons that Onyeka may not feature were not given, but it would be recalled that he suffered a knock around the knee in training with the Super Eagles in Austria. The box-to-box midfielder, who flopped on his long-awaited Super Eagles debut last week, did not feature in his Danish clubâ€™s league win over OB at the weekend. For the recent friendlies against Algeria and Tunisia, Onyeka was widely expected to stake a serious claim for a major Super Eagles role in the absence of Wilfred Ndidi, Joe Aribo and Oghenekaro Etebo. But after he hugely impressed in training with the team, he bombed against Algeria that he had to be hauled off after the first half.
