The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has called on the Federal Government to put in place recovery and resilience plans, which prioritise jobs, secure employment, protect income and ensure minimum living wages. Labour also called for a new social contract, given the negative impact of COVID-19 pandemic on health, economies and the world of work. NLC President Comrade Ayuba Wabba said this in his address to mark the 2020 World Decent Work Day with the theme: “A New Social Contract for Recovery and Resilience,” on Wednesday in Abuja. He noted that there was a need to offer hope to workers and restore economic growth, while building a people and planet-oriented global economy. The labour leader said the new contract should be anchored on shared prosperity and social justice that are central to charting the path to recovery from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Wabba, who said the current global economic model was flawed due to inequality and insecurity for workers and their families, stressed the need to promote inclusion and reduce the inequality gap. He said an adequately-funded universal public health, education care, climate and technology transitions be central in economic planning and policy framing.
