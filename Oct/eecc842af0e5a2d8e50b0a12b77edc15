LUIS SUÁREZ claims he was reduced to tears by Barcelona’s treatment of him in his final weeks at the club, which included not being allowed to take part in training matches. Suárez joined Atlético Madrid last month having become Barcelona’s third all-time top scorer with 198 goals during a glittering six-year spell at the club. He was forced out with one year left on his contract during what was, and continues to be, a messy period for the Spanish giants.  “Those days were very difficult. I cried because of what I had to go through,” said Suárez after Uruguay’s 2-1 World Cup qualifying victory over Chile on Thursday. “I didn’t take the club’s message that they were looking for a solution for me in order to mix things up very well. I was hurt most of all by the way they did things, because one has to accept it when a cycle comes to an end.”
