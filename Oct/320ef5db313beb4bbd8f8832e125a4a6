Imo State chapter of the deregistered United Progressive Party (UPP) has collapsed its structures at the state, local government and ward levels into the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The former Deputy National Chairman of the party, Chief Chris Uche, told The Nation on Thursday in Owerri that UPP fused into PDP because of its stability. “We had options because other parties approached us, but we decided to defect to PDP because of its stability. “This is the first time in the history of the country when the entire party will collapse its structures into another party,” he said.
