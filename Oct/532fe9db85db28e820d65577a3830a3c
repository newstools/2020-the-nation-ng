 THE people of Ukpo community in Njikoka Local Government Area of Anambra State have apologised to the Assistant Inspector-General of Police, Zone 13, Mohammed Danmallam, over impersonation by a member of the community’s cabinet. The member of Ukpo royal cabinet had allegedly defrauded other prominent members of the public in Anambra State, including an Anglican Bishop, of millions of Naira, using the AIG’s name. Chief Okwuchukwu Ezeaku, a member of the cabinet of the monarch of Ukpo Kingdom, Igwe Robert Eze, who led a delegation of other members of the cabinet to the AIG, said the community had removed the suspect as a member of the royal council, after investigation. The Nation gathered that the suspect was still standing trial after being arrested and paraded by the police in September.
