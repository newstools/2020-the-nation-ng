A family has refuted the story making the rounds on social media that their son Femi Abogun was an operative of the disbanded police outfit, Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), notorious for visiting brutality on innocent people. At a press briefing held in Lagos, spokesman of the family, Ola Adewunmi said that Abogun’s vehicle was only hired by SARS men during their recent operations before they were disbanded. The statement read: “Our attention has been drawn to a story by some bloggers headlined ‘faces of killer SARS (operatives) accused of killing innocent Nigerians. Abogun’s photograph was attached alongside some policemen; but we want to explicitly say that Abogun is not a policeman and has no link whatsoever with the dreaded police squad. Speaking shortly after the briefing, Abogun said: “I am a law abiding citizen, I was never a policeman and I do not have SARS identity card.”
