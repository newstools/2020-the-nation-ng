 The Senate will on October 20, debate the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) recently transmitted to the National Assembly by President Muhammadu Buhari. Senate President Ahmad Lawan, made the announcement moments before the upper chamber adjourned plenary on yesterday. According to Lawan, early debate on the Bill is expected to avert any delay in consideration, resulting from the upper chamber’s decision to suspend plenary for one month to enable Ministries, Departments and Agencies of Government defend their respective budgets for the year 2021. Lawan added that the critical piece of legislation, after the debate on the floor by lawmakers, would then pass for second reading and be referred to the Joint Committees on Petroleum; and Gas for further legislative work.  “For the PIB, we need to get the document to our Joint Committee before we suspend plenary, otherwise, the document will remain unattended to throughout the time that we would be handling the budget; and that means we can only come back to it around November or December, and that would be late. “Everybody is waiting for the PIB to be attended to, but we will take sufficient time to work on it because it is a very sensitive document. “So, while we are working on the budget, they can keep work on the PIB warm. We are not going to rush on it since we have the budget before us. “Our Joint Committee must do everything possible for us to have a document or report that we would work with in the Senate and something that Nigerians and investors will be happy with,” the Senate President said.
