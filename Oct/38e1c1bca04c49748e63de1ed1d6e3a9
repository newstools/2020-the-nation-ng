Self-acclaimed African giant, Burna Boy, has opened up on why he took a while before identifing with #ENDSARS protesters. The “Odogwu” singer had received backlash from fans for being silent while other celebrities held protests in support of campaign for disbandment of Special Anti Robbery Squared (SARS) by youths. Burna, who is in London, later took to his Twitter page to disclose his mother, who doubles as his manager, had a serious surgery which they decided to keep private. “I was dealing with a personal family issues at the beginning of these protests. My mum had serious surgery last week! We were all invested in making sure she recovers! I am not about that “put it all out on social media” life.We decided the focus must solely be on this protest,” he tweeted. However, Burna has been able to influence American rapper and music mogul Diddy to support Nigerians in the ongoing protest by lending his voice via Twitter. Burna Boy also made put up billboards around the country with the #ENDSARS inscription.
