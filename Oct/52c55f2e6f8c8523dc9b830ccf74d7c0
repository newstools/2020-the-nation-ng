English clubs made it three wins out of three games in the first round of matchdays in the Europa League and are looking towards continuing that run today as  Europe second tier club competition airs exclusively on StarTimes. The Europa League has  offered some respite for Arsenal coach Mikel Arteta after  a difficult start in their domestic league as the Gunners  got three points in the Europa League after coming from behind in Vienna to beat Rapid Wien 2-1 in their opening Group B fixture last week. Today, they will  face  Irish side Dundalk, who are participating in the group stage of the competition for the second time in their history. Another English club, Tottenham Hotspur, will be away against Belgian side, Antwerp. Both Spurs and Antwerp won their opening Group J matches and a win for either side today  will take them a giant step towards the knock-out stages, for which the top two teams from each group qualify.  Meanwhile, Leicester City are away at AEK Athens in their Europa League Group G tie. Leicester beat Ukrainian club Zorya Luhansk 3-0 in the first matchday, while AEK lost in Braga by the same score. With plenty of Europa League action to look forward to, African football fans can see all the games on their StarTimes, with the matches spread across all bouquets including NOVA bouquet which is N90 daily or N900 monthly.
