Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje has signed the Kano State Emirates Council Amendment Law, 2020, making the Kano Emir permanent chairman of the council of emirs in the state. In the former arrangement, the position used to rotate across the five first class emirs in the state. With the signing of the amended law, the Emir of Kano, Aminu Ado Bayero, remains permanent chairman of the council. His successor will also head the council. Ganduje gave assent to the new law during the State Executive Council (SEC) meeting at Africa House of Government House, Kano. “Before the signing of this Amended Law, we had four king makers from each of the five emirates. But we now have five kingmakers from each of the five emirates in the state. “We have done this to avert any unwanted situation (a tally) in an event of appointing an emir. We need to have an odd number, not even number, when voting for an emir,” Ganduje said. The governor explained that the emir of Kano being the 4th in the ranking of emirs in the country, and the fact that the Kano emir attends engagements at the national level, the Kano emir should be a permanent chairman of the State Council of Emirs, to avoid contradictions. A statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Abba Anwar, said: “very soon, the Emir of Kano (Aminu Ado Bayero) will be inaugurated as the Chairman of the State Council of Emirs.” The statement added that the Secretariat, located at Gidan Shettima, is being renovated in preparation for the inauguration.
