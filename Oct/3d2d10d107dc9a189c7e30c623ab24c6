 WORLD number one golfer  Dustin Johnson has tested positive for Covid-19, the PGA Tour said in a statement . The 36-year-old American has withdrawn from the CJ Cup at Shadow Creek after testing positive for Covid-19. Experiencing symptoms, Johnson notified PGA Tour officials and was administered a test. The positive result forced his withdrawal from the CJ Cup event. Johnson, who last competed at the US Open, will have the PGA Tour’s full support throughout his self-isolation period under CDC guidelines. “Obviously, I am very disappointed,” said Johnson. “I was really looking forward to competing this week, but will do everything I can to return as quickly as possible.” “I have already had a few calls with the TOUR’s medical team and appreciate all the support and guidance they have given me.”
