 THREE men on Monday appeared before an Ado-Ekiti Chief Magistrates’ Court chaarged with exhuming of bodies at a cemetery in Ekiti State. The defendants, Kola Fatoye, 40, Abimbola Fatoye, 35, and Ahmed Ojo, 56, committed the offence between March and September 2020, in Orun-Ekiti, prosecutor Monica Ikebuilo said. She said the defendants dug up graves and severed heads of corpses at St. Paul Anglican Church Cemetery in Orun-Ekiti. Ikebuilo said that the severed bodies were those of Philip Akintayo, Moreani Ajayi and eight others, alleging that the suspects used the extracted parts of the bodies for ritual. “The charms from the ritual were found with the defendants,” she claimed. The plea of the defendants was not taken, and were remand in a correctional centre, as Chief Magistrate, Mrs Adefumike Anoma adjourned the case until November 6.
