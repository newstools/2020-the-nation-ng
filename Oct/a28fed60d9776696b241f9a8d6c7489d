Ademola Lookman ended a three-year Premier League goal drought in Fulhamâ€™s 1-1 draw against Sheffield United. The forward arrived at Craven Cottage on a season-long loan from Bundesliga side RB Leipzig this summer and has been delivering impressive showings. Lookman had previously starred for Charlton Athletic and Everton before leaving for Germany to continue his development. The 22-year-old was handed his first Premier League start for the Cottagers at Bramall Lane following his stand-out performance against Wolverhampton Wanderers last time out. The Nigerian attacker made the most of the opportunity when he scored his first goal for the newly-promoted Premier League side against Sheffield.= The first-half produced few goal-mouth actions, with both sides missing a number of goal-scoring opportunities. After the restart, a glorious opportunity fell in the way of Aleksandar Mitrovic to open the scoring for Fulham but he missed his strike from the penalty spot. Lookman then put his side in front with a spectacular strike past goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale in the 77th minute. The 22-year-old twisted and turned past his markers before firing home a beauty into the roof of the net. The effort is his first in the Premier League since January 2017 when he made a goalscoring debut for Everton against Manchester City. Billy Sharp then levelled proceedings for Sheffield United with five minutes left to play to deny the Craven Cottage outfit all three points. Lookman featured for the duration of the game along with Nigeria international Ola Aina, who is also another summer recruit and Tosin Adarabioyo. The forward will hope to continue his impressive performances and help Fulham end their four-game winless run across all competitions when they take on Crystal Palace on October 24. Goal
