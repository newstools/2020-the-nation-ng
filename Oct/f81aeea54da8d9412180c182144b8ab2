The Super Eagles on Friday night were defeated by African champions Algeria. The encounter was the first match for the Gernot Rohr-led Eagles in 2020. They failed to end the unbeaten run of the reigning African champions Algeria. Ramy Bensebainiâ€™s fifth minute strike settle score as the Super Eagles slumped to a third straight defeat to African champions Algeria 1-0 in an international friendly at the Worthesee Stadium, Klagenfurt, Austria. Bensebaini poked home from close range after the Eagles defence failed to clear their lines from a corner kick.
