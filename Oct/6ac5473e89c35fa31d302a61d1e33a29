 THE Federal Government on Tuesday told the international community that  it was not  repressive in dealing with issues affecting Nigerians. It also assured that it would continue to obey the rule of law and allow democracy to grow in the country. The government however expressed displeasure that in spite of having met the demands of the protesters, some misguided elements had introduced mayhem. Information and Culture  Lai Mohammed, Foreign Affairs Minister,  Geoffrey Onyeama and Aviation Minister,  Hadi Sirika,  made these known to the members of the diplomatic corps in Abuja. The briefing which was at the instance of the government was aimed at keeping the international community abreast of happenings in the country and  what it  was  doing  to prevent total breakdown of law and order. The International community had been disturbed by the turn of event in the country following the two-week protests which have turned violence. Mohammed described  protests such as #EndSARS as an  integral part of democracy but pointed that no responsible government would wait and watch anarchy to happen before acting. He said,“We are not a repressive regime. For the past 12 or 13 days, protesters have been allowed to express themselves provided they don’t get violent. The police have conducted themselves very admirably, even under provocation, they remained very restrained. “But like I said at several fora, no responsible government will fold its arms and allow the country to go into anarchy. We owe all Nigerians responsibility to protect their lives and their sources of livelihood. “In the last 12 or 13  days, many Nigerians have been prevented, especially in Lagos, from going to work. Police have been attacked in several states and even some members of the movement have admitted that the protests have  been hijacked.”
