Vice Presidential candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), in 2019 elections, Mr. Peter Obi, has explained to the Christian faithful that being a bishop in any religious denomination or being in any position of authority is not a title we cling unto, but a call to duty and service to God and humanity. Obi, who made this known at Arondizuogu during the installation of Rt Revd Henry Okechukwu Okeke, as the 3rd Bishop of Ideato Diocese, Anglican Communion, explained that people, Christians included, are often carried away by vain titles given among men, leaving off the main substance, which is the call to service, behind such names. He said that being a Bishop should not be seen as a mere title, but as a higher platform to render services to God and the people of God. Obi praised Bishop Henry Okeke for what he described as ‘his extra-ordinary level of commitment to his ministry in God’. He said he had known and admired Bishop Okeke’s style of spiritual leadership and zeal for progress during the Bishop’s days as the Former Bishop of Mbamili, Anambra State. He prayed to God to sustain Bishop Okeke in His abundant grace. Advising other leaders and Christians to follow after the leadership style of Bishop Okeke, Obi blamed the country’s political and economic woes on leadership failure in the country. Obi said Nigeria would begin to witness substantial progress if her leaders lived above their greed and began to use public funds for public service.
