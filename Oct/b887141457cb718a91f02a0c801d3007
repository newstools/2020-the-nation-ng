 Nigeria Breweries Plc has set aside N40million to support over 200 small businesses in its Life Lager “Chop Life” Experience initiative. The campaign will see Life Lager empower its consumers with cash to support their businesses. This will be done through in-bar activations that will span across southeastern cities such as Enugu, Aba, Uyo, Warri, Onitsha, and Port Harcourt between September 27 and October 25, 2020. Its National Trade Marketing Manager, Funso Ayeni, expressed delight at the launch of the initiative. He said: “As a brand, Life Lager believes in progress, and the Chop Life Experience is our way of empowering our consumers. We recognise that sometimes all we need is financial support to get our dreams off the ground, and help us progress. We share this sentiment, and we are humbled to have the opportunity to support businesses across the southeast.” He explained that Life Lager had a good year with remarkable initiatives such as its brand relaunch, as well as the widely acclaimed lighting of the Niger Bridge and the release of its theme song titled “Chop Life” featuring Phyno and Flavour.  Unveiled on August 1, the Niger Bridge lights further established Life Lager as a truly progressive brand, while its timely message of self preservation; “Ndu Ka” was praised for its relevance and significance, particularly during the lockdown period of the pandemic. The Chop Life Experience, which started on September 27, has run through Enugu, Ikom, Makurdi, Port Harcourt, Onitsha, Aba and Warri and to proceed to Owerri, Fegge, Oji, Otukpo, Asaba, Nkpor, Okigwe, Agbani, Aba, Nsukka, Festac and Nnewi  in the coming weeks. Life Lager Beer was first brewed in Onitsha, Anambra State in 1981 and has since grown from a regional beer brand to becoming one of the leading lager brands in the country. The brand is best known for its rich taste and its optimistic theme of progress.
