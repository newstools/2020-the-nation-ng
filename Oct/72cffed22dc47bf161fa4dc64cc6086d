 Coach Gernot Rohr said the Super Eagles would expectedly miss the experiences of its midfield lynchpins in the two upcoming friendly matches against Algeria and Tunisia in Austria; with the unavailability of the injured trio of Wilfred Ndidi, Oghenekaro Etebo and Jo Aribo. Short of lamenting the absence of his tried and trusted lieutenants, the German further told NationSport that the friendlies against the two North African sides would be a good opportunity of testing new players. “Unfortunately, we don’t have these players including Osimhen,” the 67-year-old Rohr told NationSport.  “We are going to miss our three defensive midfielders Etebo, Ndidi and Aribo. “Don’t forget Aribo has also been important for us and apart from the three   of them, we still don’t have our key goalkeepers here and that is Francis Uzoho and Daniel Akpeyi.  “We are going to be complicated in three midfield because of the injuries of Etebo, Ndidi and Aribo. “ Yet Rohr said he was excited  with the plethora of new  Super Eagles invitees, adding  his priority is recruiting  new players to help the cause of the national team. “Of course, it’s is good all the time  to see new players  because we are not playing only for the results but  to  see new compositions and complexities ,” affirmed Rohr.“ Altogether, we  have eight new players   who are coming for the first time. “It is a lot but it’s a good opportunity for us to test these new players because serious competition will start in November,” added the former Bayern Munich defender.
