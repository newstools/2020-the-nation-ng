A 21-year-old man Onyeamachi Mmaju has been arrested for allegedly stabbing his landlord to death in Ogidi, Ani-Etiti in Idemili North Local Government Area of Anambra State. The suspect was said to have stabbed and killed Nonso Umeadi Oyiboko, who reportedly challenged him for womanising. The Nation gathered that the suspect was fond of bringing women into the apartment, a development the landlord was not comfortable with. “The landlord could not believe his eyes when he saw Onyeamachi approach him with a knife. Before people could come to his rescue, the landlord was already on the floor with blood all over his body,” a neighbour said. Police spokesman Haruna Mohammed confirmed the incident, saying the suspect has been arrested.
