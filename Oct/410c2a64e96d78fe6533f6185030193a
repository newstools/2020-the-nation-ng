The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) caucus in the House of Representatives has called on the Federal Government and the Police High Command to immediately begin the prosecution of security agents involved in the killing of defenceless Nigerians over the years. The PDP lawmakers also commiserated with Oyo state Governor, Seyi Makinde, over the death of his mother, Abigail Makinde and the killing of #ENDSARS protesters in the state. In a statement in Abuja, Leader of the Caucus, Kingsley Chinda, said  the decision of the governor to compensate the families of Isiaka Jimoh, Ganiyu Moshood Alabi and Adeoye Taiwo, who died in the hands of security agents during the anti-SARS protest in the state was commendable. Chinda asked other state governors to emulate Makinde’s kind gesture towards the anti-SARS victims in their states. The caucus said: “Governor Makinde deserves the accolades of well-meaning Nigerians. We call on other governors to emulate him on this issue. It is not enough for the government to say they would prosecute those behind the killings of innocent Nigerians. “We want to see this commitment in practical terms. One week is a long time to bring the culprits to face the wrath of the law. It is our view that the government must demonstrate its willingness to stop police brutality by arraigning those behind the murder of innocent Nigerians in court. “We will also want the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Mohammed Adamu to take punitive measures against the culprits. In sane societies, they should have been dismissed from the police force by now even before bringing them to face justice over their brutal acts.”
