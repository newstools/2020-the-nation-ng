 FORMER U-23 international, David Okereke made his long awaited comeback for Club Brugge yesterday against Anderlecht after he recovered from Coronavirus. Club Brugge stuned Anderlecht 3-0 through the goals of Keeping Diatta, Hans Vanaken and Ruud Corner in the 23rd, 48th and 90th minutes with Vanaken strike coming from the penalty spot. Okereke last month was reported to have contracted the Coronavirus but he had since recovered and was introduced by Club Brugge head coach Phillipe Clement in the 86th minute for Krepin Diatta for his fifth game of the season. The former Spezia of Italy winger scored his first goal of the season on September 12 in their 4-1 home win over Waasland Beveren.
