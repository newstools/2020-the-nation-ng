In furtherance of the efforts in alleviating suffering occasioned by the Covid-19 pandemic, a non-governmental organisation, United Way Greater Nigeria (UWGN) in collaboration with 3M, an international organisation has stated that over 6,000 persons benefited from the recently concluded palliative distribution exercise in Lagos. According to the statement made available to the press, Kamil Bakare, Executive Director, UWGN, the duo concluded the distribution of palliatives in Lagos with 2000 care packages containing staple food items and cooking ingredients to vulnerable families and individuals affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in Epe and Badagry areas of the state. Bakare stated the Covid-19 pandemic has been unparalleled health and socio-economic crisis that has incommensurately affected the Nation’s most vulnerable, adding that UWGN is fighting tirelessly to bridge the gap between vulnerable Nigerians, corporate organisations, and businesses willing to deliver meaningful and measurable change that can advance sustainable development in Nigeria. “With the financial support of 3M, we implemented a Covid-19 relief outreach that supported about 10 communities in the 5 administrative zones in Lagos State with 6,000 beneficiaries and will be expanding to other geopolitical zones of Nigeria. We have worked with the tireless support of local partners including the government, NGOs and religious organizations, and community representatives. “The Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting lockdown has led to businesses closing down and individuals losing their sources of income; although the lockdown has gradually been eased, and things are going back to normal, United Way Greater Nigeria understands that there is still a growing need for these basic amenities as some of these vulnerable families hardest hit financial, by the pandemic are still trying hard to make ends meet. We appreciate our donors, sponsors, and volunteers for their unwavering support to fight for our cause and we are looking forward to reaching more lives during these trying times.” Bakare stressed.
