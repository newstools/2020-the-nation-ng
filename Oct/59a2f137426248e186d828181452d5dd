A network has been launched in three communities in Yaba, Lagos to help fight sexual and gender-based violence in the state. The African Centre for Leadership, Strategy and Development (Centre LSD) inaugurated the network and also trained men to coordinate its activities in Iwaya, Makoko and Adekunle areas of Yaba. Traditional and religious leaders, youth groups, and security personnel attended the event. Project Coordinator of Centre LSD Vincent Dania said the network would serve as an advocacy platform to promote gender-equitable norms, attitudes and behaviour, in relation to women and girlsâ€™ sexuality and reproduction at the community level. He noted that the organisation has done a baseline studies and have found that there is a prevalence of gender-based violence in the three communities which are caused by illiteracy and poverty. Dania said that the focus area of the project would be to address sexual and gender-based violence, harmful practices and sexual and reproductive health and rights.
