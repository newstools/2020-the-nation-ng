 THE Federal Government has announced October 12 as the date for full reopening of the 104 unity schools across the country. Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, made the announcement at a briefing. The Federal Government announced the closure of schools in March to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Adamu said the decision was taken after due consultation with the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19. The minister said states and private school owners were at liberty to work out modalities for the reopening of schools under their purview. He urged school owners to put in place systems that meet social distancing procedures and other COVID-19 guidelines developed for safe reopening of schools. The minister warned that any school owner who does not comply with the guidelines risk closure if an outbreak of the virus occurs in the learning facilities. He said: “Consequently, after due consultation with the Presidential Committee on Covid-19, we have decided that all our 104 unity colleges should reopen on the 12 of October, 2020. “States and private school owners will work out modalities for the opening of schools under their purview. “As we all work towards the reopening of learning facilities nationwide, I strongly urge school owners to put in place systems that meet safe distancing procedures and others. “Let me warn that any school owner that doesn’t comply with these guidelines and an outbreak occurs in the school due to negligence, risks closure. “Be vigilant, strict and rigid in the implementation of Covid-19 protocols for the safety of our children and ourselves as we reopen schools. Nothing should be taken for granted.”
