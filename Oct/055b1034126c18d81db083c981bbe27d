  ALHAJI Taoreed Faronbi has been rocking the Lagos social scene for over three decades and he doesn’t look like he’s ready to retire soon. Also known as Baba Alado and Baba Oba of Itoriland, the popular Lagos socialite was one of the faces who honoured Olu of Itori, Oba Abdulfatai Akorede Akamo on his 60th birthday. But he didn’t come alone as he was in the company of his new wife, Alhaja Modinat, and they looked perfect for each other. Faronbi, who is head of Alagbeji Royal family in Papa Ajao, Mushin, Lagos, rocked a white cotton Swiss lace while his entourage were dressed in royal blue T-shirts. When the Baba Oba of Itoriland moved to the stage to dance to King Wasiu Ayinde’s music and spray money on him, his wife joined him also.
