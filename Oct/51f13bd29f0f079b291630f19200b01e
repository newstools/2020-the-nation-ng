 Ahead of the 2023 general election, the opposition All Progressives Congress (APC) in Taraba State is working hard to put its house in order and go into the election united. Sentry recalls that infighting among its members, leading to the exit of some leading lights from its fold, cost the party the governorship in 2019. It appears the party is now desirous of winning come 2023. Moves towards uniting the various camps started last month with a meeting of major stakeholders held in Abuja to discuss how peace can return to the party. The successful parley led to four subsequent meetings within and outside the state, where far-reaching decisions were taken and agreements reached. Sources say state chairman, Tukur El-Sudi, is now the rallying point for all interest groups. “The agreement is that everybody should regard him as the party leader for now and listen to him. Gradually, we will resuscitate all other organs of the party in Taraba State in such ways that everybody will submit to just one leadership,” a source said. Another meeting of the party’s stakeholders is scheduled to hold early in October in Abuja to put finishing touches to the memorandum of understanding to guide APC operations in Taraba as it prepares to challenge the ruling Peoples’ Democratic Party’s (PDP) dominance.
