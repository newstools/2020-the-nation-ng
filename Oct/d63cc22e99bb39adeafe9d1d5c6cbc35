Mrs. Tola Oyediaran that I commiserate with the family, friends and associates of the deceased.” “Reverend Oyediran undoubtedly touched many people’s lives while she was alive. She was a true compatriot, a passionate leader, loving mother and an embodiment of humility.” “Oyediran used her God-given talents, resources and media platforms to emancipate the Yoruba race and Nigerian as a whole.” “The late Oyediran’s tenure as chairman of the Board of Directors of African Newspapers Plc (publishers of Tribune newspaper), which just began after serving her first tenure witnessed growth in the organization.” “On behalf of my family and the good people Lagos State, I hereby express my heartfelt condolences to the Oyediran and Awolowo over the loss of Rev.
