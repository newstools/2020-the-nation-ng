 POOR service delivery, inefficiency, and perennial gridlock in Apapa are affecting the revenue of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) and other government agencies at the sea-ports, it was learnt. The country, it was gathered, lost a total of 56 million tonnes of cargoes to Benin, Ghana, Togo, and Cote D’Ivoire in the last four years. Sources at the Federal Ministry of Transportation (FMoT) told The Nation that the neighbouring ports have become the new transit corridors for cargoes going to the landlocked countries based on the provision of better services and routes for moving goods to Niger, Chad, Mali and Burkina, among others. The senior official, who craved anonymity said NPA, NIMASA and other agencies are losing huge revenue on about four million metric tonnes of transit cargoes to the neighbouring ports yearly, because the two Lagos ports are known for its perennial traffic congestion and poor service deliveries. The senior FMoT official lamented that some containers transiting the Port of Lome had increased geometrically and reaching 1.19million TEUs in recent times. He berated a situation where the size of ships that are berthing at Lome, Togo, are more than double the size of the vessels that are calling at the Lagos ports. The Vice President, Association of Nigerian Licensed Customs Agents (ANLCA) Dr Kayode Farinto, corroborated the FMoT official. Farinto said Senegal, Togo and some other neighbouring are offering better efficient services than the two Lagos ports, saying this had attributed to a downward trend of traffic at the ports. The data from NPA has shown that the ships and cargoes coming into the port have reduced seriously. For instance, in the last one year, the number of ships, which called at the country’s ports, dropped to 953 from 1, 066 and 1,077 in the second quarter of last year and first quarter of the year, indicating a decline 10.6 per cent and 11.6 per cent.

Also, the NPA data explained that Tin Can Island Port recorded a decrease of 24.2 per cent, while Lagos Port Complex recorded a decline of 17.3 per cent. It noted that the overall cargoes traffic witnessed a negative variance from  the second quarter of last year and first quarter of the year as cargo throughput decreased to 18.5million  tonnes from 20.07million tonnes and 20.6milliontonnes, leading to a decline of eight per cent and 10.6 per cent from second quarter of last year and first quarter of this year. “An analysis of the cargo throughput in comparison with the second quarter of 2019 revealed that inward cargoes recorded a decrease of 14.4 per cent, while outward cargoes increased by 4.9 per cent. When compared with the first quarter of 2020, inward cargoes decreased by 10.6 per cent, while outward cargoes declined by 10.5 per cent. The decrease in outward cargoes over the second quarter 2019 was due to 17.4 per cent increase in LNG shipment during the period. “A total 367, 088 Twenty Equivalent Units (TEUs) was handled at the port in the second quarter of 2020, showing a decline of 29 per cent and 5 per cent from 517, 263 TEUS and 386, 422 TEUs handled in the second quarter of 2019 and first quarter of 2020 respectively,” the data explained. A breakdown of container traffic revealed that laden containers stood at 220, 823 TEUs representing 61 per cent of the total container traffic and decrease of 35.3 per cent from 341, 472 TEUs laden containers handled in the second quarter of 2019. Although,  the data explained that LNG shipment and dry bulk cargoes had a positive variance at 17.4 per cent and 13.4 per cent growth respectively noting that refined petroleum cargo dropped by 9.6 per cent, while other general cargoes dropped by 20.9 per cent. But it added that further breakdown of container traffic indicated  that Tincan Island Port handled 42 per cent of the container traffic, while Lagos Port Complex and Onne Port handled 40 per cent and 17 per cent respectively. Investigation also revealed that the total vehicle traffic stood at 54, 458 units, a decrease of 25.1 per cent and 28.4 per cent  from 72,691 units and 76, 034 units handled in second quarter and first quarter of 2020 respectively, adding that the Tincan Island Port handled 99.4 per cent of the total vehicle traffic.
