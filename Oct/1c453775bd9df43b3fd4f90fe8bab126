The Chinese community in Lagos has organised a cultural show to celebrate the 60th Independence Anniversary of Nigeria. The celebration on October 1 coincides with the commemoration of the establishment of the People’s Republic of China on October 1, 1949. The cultural show is designed to celebrate the rich diversities of the two countries as well as donate cheques to local communities. Chief Matthew Uwaekwe, who received the cheques on behalf of the communities, described the gesture as important in building the relationship between Nigeria and China. Some Chinese cultural dance such as The Lion Dance, The Dragon Dance, The Street Dance, The Flower Drum Lamp, and Nigeria Traditional Dance were on a display by the Huaxing Art Troupe in Nigeria. A Chinese community leader in Lagos, who also is the leader of the Nigeria Huaxing Art Troupe, Eric Ni, said: “China and Nigeria share a lot in common, this is not the first time we will be giving financial support to students in Nigeria, we chose to do this to appreciate the good relationship between both countries”. The events, which held behind closed doors due to the COVID- 19 protocols in the country, will be streamed on national televisions in Nigeria and China.
