The rivalry between supporters of Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun and loyalists of his predecessor and senator representing Ogun Central at the National Assembly, Ibikunle Amosun, is not abating. If anything, the gulf between the two prominent blocs within the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the Gateway State is deepening. Recently, the intra-party grudges heightened after Amosun’s loyalists went to town with allegations that Abiodun may have quietly embarked on a move to probe the former governor’s administration. Sentry gathered that the crux of the disagreement is than action taken by Ogun State House of Assembly. During the week, the assembly through its Committee on Public Account and Anti-Corruption called on the immediate past Managing Director, Ogun State Property and Investment Corporations (OPIC), Jide Odusolu, to explain the finances of the corporation under his watch – especially in relation to the running of its investments. Hardly had the assembly issued the directive before tongues started wagging that Amosun was the target of the alleged probe. For their part, Abiodun’s supporters wondered why the senator and his men were disturbed if they had no skeleton in their cupboard. “Abiodun hasn’t got time to chase shadows. They are just afraid of their handiwork. Otherwise, must they interpret everything as being targeted at them,” a party leader asked on Wednesday. Reminding Sentry that Committee Chairman, Musefiu Lamidi, also directed the management of OPIC to furnish it with more documents on how the corporation was ran under Odusolu, a known ally of Amosun, a former commissioner in the state challenged the governor to come out openly with his intentions. “If he wants to probe his predecessor, he should say it and stop using ideas,” he told Sentry. As we speak, the rumbling continues.
