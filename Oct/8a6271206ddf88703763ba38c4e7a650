 NAPOLI striker Victor Osimhen will not be part of the Super Eagles team that will play against Algeria and Tunisia in Austria in an international friendly scheduled for October 9 and 13 following COVID-19 restrictions put in place by his Italian club. Osimhen has been replaced by Belgium-based Paul Onuachu who has been in scoring form for Genk this season having scored seven goals so far in seven league matches. The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) made this disclosure in its twitter handle yesterday. “@victorosimhen9 has been excused from @NGSuperEagles’ games against Algeria and Tunisia. His replacement is Paul Onuachu. #Team9jaStrong #SoarSuperEagles.” Napoli announced on Saturday that COVID-19 tests were carried out on all their players, with Macedonian midfielder Elif Elmas being the only player tested positive. However, Italian Minister of Health Roberto Speranza has insisted that it was unsafe for the Napoli squad to travel and the team has been prevented from travelling outside the region to Turin for their Serie A clash at the Allianz Stadium. Napoli had also announced through their coach Rino Gattuso that players and staff were in isolation and would not travel for their international fixtures. On Saturday, team officials and backroom staff of the Super Eagles left Nigeria for Austria, ahead of the games against Algeria on Friday. Nigeria will confront the reigning continental champions Algeria at the Jacques Lemans Arena.
