Vice-Chancellor of Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta (FUNAAB), Prof. Kolawole Salako has said the institution had been working with farmers in Southwest to improve cassava production.This, he said, is to actualise the school’s tripartite mandate. The VC noted  that the university had been involved in giving improved varieties of crops to farmers, especially with the Cassava: Adding Value for Africa (CAVA), as sponsored by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. He recalled that during his days as the Director of the Agricultural Media Resources and Extension Centre (AMREC) of FUNAAB, the institution had worked with virtually all communities in the Southwest region by giving improved varieties of crops to farmers.  He said the Universities of Agriculture should integrate everything they do; be it Basic Science, Engineering or Management Science into the development of agriculture in Nigeria. On mass production of food, Salako said  very soon, with the support of the government and philanthropists, FUNAAB could feed Ogun State even though it had been producing for its immediate environment. He also said the institution had prepared for post-COVID-19 in the area of food production, but was slowed down by the rain that stopped midway. On resumption, he said  FUNAAB had embarked on the building of more classrooms to curb the pandemic while the institution was also working tirelessly to ensure that lecturers deliver lectures to their students by using a combination of physical contact and virtual learning.
