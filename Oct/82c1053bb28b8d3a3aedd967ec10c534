 FORMER Super Eagles coach Austin Eguavoen is set to be named the head coach of Malien de Bamako of Mali. The former Nigeria international defender is expected to arrive in Bamako today to formally take charge of the 2009 CAF Confederation Cup champions. Eguavoen led the Super Eagles to a bronze medal at the 2006 African Cup of Nations in Egypt and has also coached Bendel Insurance, Sharks FC, Nigeria U17 and U23.   LIVERPOOL will reportedly be without Thiago Alcantara for tomorrow’s  night’s Champions League opener against Ajax. The 29-year-old put in a man-of-the-match display on his full debut for the team during Saturday’s Merseyside derby against Everton.
