 Super Eagles midfielder Joe Aribo made his second appearance for Rangers’ following his six-week lay-off due to injury and the Nigerian was on target for Rangers in their 2-0 win over Livingston in the Scottish Premier League (SPL). It was Jermain Defoe who scored his 300th goal in club football that sealed the victory for Rangers as the Steven Gerrard side moved six points clear in the Scottish Premiership with the home victory over Livingston. The 38-year-old Briton produced a sublime finish to put Rangers two ahead in the 16th minute as Steven Gerrard’s side made the most of the opportunity presented by Aberdeen’s late equaliser in a 3-3 draw with Celtic. Aribo had earlier put Rangers in front in the 9th minutes and the victory was further evidence of both the increased depth and focus of Rangers this season as they followed up last weekend’s victory at Celtic Park. Gerrard rotated his squad following Thursday’s Europa League win over Standard Liege, with Aribo and Defoe among five players coming in.  Ianis Hagi dispossessed Efe Ambrose and set up Defoe, whose shot was stopped by the goalkeeper’s legs. But Hagi showed good awareness to square to Aribo, who swept the ball into the empty net. Rangers now have the chance to go nine points clear at Kilmarnock next Sunday, albeit Celtic will have two games in hand.
