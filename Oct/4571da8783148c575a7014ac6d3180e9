 A beauty queen, Precious Nengi Tamunopekerebia, has opened up on her decision to take up charitable causes even after her reign as Miss Planet Nigeria. The 19-year-old had provided support for people in a bid to cushion the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Speaking with The Nation, she disclosed that her activities in providing help for the needy was just one of the many charitable efforts she loves doing. In her words: “Well, I’ve done quite a number of projects aside from the ones I did during the COVID-19 lockdown. For instance, on Valentine’s Day, I visited the Okujagu community to give gifts to elderly people. I felt it was the right thing to extend love to people there. On that same day, I mobilised a clean up at Government Technical college in Port Harcourt, with the students as a part of the project activities during the secondary school sensitization and advocacy campaign tour in preparation for earth day 2020 with recycling. Also, in April, I took part in an advocacy campaign by spreading awareness on my social media page. It’s something I really love doing; I find joy in making people smile.” Tamunopekerebia highlighted her plans saying she intends to set up a foundation. “After my reign, I’ll open a foundation with which I’ll be able to continue giving back to society. Aside from this, of course, I will also have to focus on school and my business. My career goal is to become the CEO of my own clothing/cosmetics brand. I’m currently working on it and in a few years I should have expanded beyond the shores of Nigeria. And as my mother always tells me, ‘Never settle for less than your best.’ So, it is on that note I plan to claw my way to the top.” The beauty queen is scheduled to represent Nigeria at the Miss Planet International Pageant, amongst 60 countries in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.
