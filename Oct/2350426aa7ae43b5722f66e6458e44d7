Not less than 10 political parties that fielded candidates for Saturday’s governorship election in Ondo have collapsed their structures into the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The parties that collapsed their structures were Accord Party, Action Alliance, African Democratic Party, APGA, and AAC. Others were APM, APP, NNPP, NRM, and SDP. Speaking on behalf of the group, Chairman of the Social Democratic Party,(SDP), Dele Ogunbameru, said the decision to support Jegede was to ensure the ruling All Progressives Congress(APC) is sacked. Ogunbameru said: “Political parties participating in Ondo 2020 governorship election in Ondo state have resolved to back the PDP candidate, Eyitayo Jegede, for the poll. “We are committed to good governance in Ondo state, which we believe can only be offered by the PDP at this present austere period. “There is no gainsaying that the present political leadership in Ondo state can be described as nothing but an antenna in the face of things. “This collaboration is an organised effort to save Ondo state from the political quagmire and undesirable socioeconomic predicament of our people “The ten political party leaders, therefore, resolved to work as a team in tandem with the PDP well-captured manifesto for the welfare, well-being, and life more abundant for the good people of Ondo state.” Appreciating the group, the Chairman of PDP, Fatai Adams, commended them for their decision to join the winning train and said: “Your support is all we need to take Ondo State to the level and deliver the state from shackles.”
