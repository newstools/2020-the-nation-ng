The Centre for Creative Scientists in Niger Delta has extolled the Federal Government for involving Nigerian researchers across the board in the search for a home-grown remedy for coronavirus. Its Head, Chief Apollos Keniyinbo, said the invitation to local scientists to showcase their solutions to the novel coronavirus was a reassurance that the government believed in the capacity of Nigerian scientists. Keniyinbo, who spoke in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State capital, on Tuesday, said the move had boosted the patriotism of home-based scientists.  He said he had since taken advantage of the window to submit his remedy for evaluation. He added that the coronavirus had defied conventional thinking, adding that there was the need for Nigeria to look beyond the developed countries for a vaccine and cure for the virus. Keniyinbo stated: “The invitation to Nigerian researchers and scientists by the Federal Government to join efforts in the search for a home-grown remedy coordinated by the Minister of Science and Technology deserves commendation. “The minister did set up a committee to evaluate the claims and remedy by home-based researchers.”
