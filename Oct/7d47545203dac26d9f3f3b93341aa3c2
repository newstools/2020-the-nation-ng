 Licensed Customs agents in Eastern Ports have frowned at what they called freight differentials between Lagos and Eastern Ports, arguing that there is no justification for the development. They maintained that such a system favours Lagos ports ahead of the Eastern ports. Speaking at the 10th Anniversary of Global Rays magazine, a maritime and Energy newsmagazine, in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital, the Chairman of the occasion, Sir Henry Njoku, noted that the differentials had become a huge discouragement against patronage of Eastern ports aside bad roads and insecurity bedeviling the ports. Njoku, who was represented by Michael Ebealu, a former Chairman, Oil and Gas Free Zone of the Association of Nigerian Licensed Customs Agents, said: “A situation where we have a differential of $1, 500 between the Lagos and Eastern ports will always encourage shippers to prefer Lagos Ports and abandon other areas.”  The publisher of the Global Rays Magazine, Apostle Tony Nzekwe, expressed happiness on the feats the Global Rays has achieved in 10 years of its existence. He revealed that it is God that has seen him through adding that, dedication, commitment, consistency and follow-up, including purpose-driven life are, among the factors,that saw him through. “It wasn’t easy at first, but today, God has been faithful.”  The event also witnessed the presentation of awards of excellence to deserving stakeholders in the marine industry, who have distinguished themselves in the sector, including the CGC, Col. Hammed Ali (rtd).
