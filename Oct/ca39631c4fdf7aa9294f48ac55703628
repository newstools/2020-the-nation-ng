Leader of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) Nnamdi Kanu on Tuesday raised the alarm that suspected herdsmen were spotted roaming around the streets of his home town, Isiama Afaraukwu Ibeku in Umuahia North Local Government Area of Abia State. Kanu, in a statement by IPOB Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, said he did not know their mission but alleged it was another systematic move to eliminate more of his people in Umuahia without provocation. He disclosed that the herdsmen were spotted in the alleged army and police uniforms on October 12, 2020, through a constant live CCTV monitor. The statement reads in part: “Early this morning of the 12th of October 2020 the terrorist Janjaweed Army of the Mohammedian Emirates of Northern Nigeria has once again commenced their siege on Isiama-Afaraukwu my village in search of innocent citizens to kill. “They are in another range of systematic move to eliminate more of our people in Umuahia without provocation. “They are under constant live CCTV surveillance, therefore, any terrorist attack on my village by this band of uniformed terrorists will be captured and broadcast live for the world to see. “The world must stop supporting Fulani terrorists in power in Nigeria. My village is not Sambisa forest.”
