Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc (FMN) has announced activities to commemorate its 60 years existence of creating innovative and sustainable value in agriculture and food production. The company boasts of a rich leadership history in Nigeria’s food industry and value-chain through a legacy of impactful investments, job creation, community development, and economic growth. FMN has also created value along the entire food chain with its “farm-to-table” model by providing inputs and know-how to farmers, aggregating and sourcing crops and raw materials to supply its world-class processing facilities across Nigeria, and distributing its innovative food brands to its customers. Speaking on this development in a statement made available to newsmen in Abuja, the CEO/GMD FMN, Paul Gbededo, said; “this year marks an important milestone for Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc as we commemorate 60 great years of enriching lives and empowering communities. Exactly sixty years ago, FMN was born through the vision and dedication of our founding father, George Stavros Coumantaros, to create a winning brand that would one day become a household name in Nigeria.” According to him, “from generation to generation, FMN and Golden Penny have been with Nigerians, through the best of times and at the most difficult of times; a testament to the fact that our connection with our beloved country truly runs deep. So, as our nation celebrates its 60th anniversary, we are proud to celebrate our shared history by recognising the people who have supported our vision through the years. We want to say thank you to Nigeria for standing with us over the years while also shining a light on the people who are rarely in the spotlight; our employees, partners, dealers and stakeholders.”
