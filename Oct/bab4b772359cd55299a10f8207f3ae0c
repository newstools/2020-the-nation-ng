 THE four JS-3 students and their teacher kidnapped in a Kaduna village have been set free. They were whisked away six weeks ago when armed kidnappers invaded Damba Kasaya village in Buruku, Chikun local council area of the state. The gunmen killed a 29-year-old man, Benjamin Auta during the invasion and set a worship centre on fire before kidnapping four students and a teacher of Prince Academy, Damba Kasaya. A source said the abductees were released on Saturday night after an undisclosed amount was paid as ransom in two tranches. According to him, â€œWe thank you for your concern over the kidnap of some of our children and their teacher by bandits in August. Christiana Madugu (female teacher), Miracle Saitu Danjuma (female student) Favour Danjuma (female student) Happy Odoji (female student, and Ezra Bako (male student) were abducted from Prince Academy while preparing for the just-concluded junior secondary school examination in Kaduna State.
