 The demand for sugar is on the increase in the country, it was learnt. Although the country reportedly has the potential to meet local sugar demand, lack of infrastructure, inconsistency in government policy and difficulty in accessing and owning arable land for sugarcane plantation are threatening the over N160billion sugar investment across the nation, findings have revealed. It was projected that the country would need 1.7 million metric tonnes to meet local consumption this year. In the West African subregion, Nigeria remains the largest importer of the commodity, while in the African continent, it is second to Algeria, the largest importer at 2,265,000 metric tonnes. The world’s top ten producers of sugar cane, according to the U.S. report, include India, Brazil, the European Union, Thailand, China, United States, Pakistan, Mexico, Russia and Australia. South Africa is Africa’s largest exporter and the eighth largest in the world. It was learnt that the country has been finding it difficult to achieve its target since 2013 because of lack of infrastructure and other challenges militating against local production. Sources at the Federal Ministry of Finance (FMoF) said that over $100 million is spent annually on sugar importation into the country. According to the National Sugar Development Council, (NSDC), sugar consumption in Nigeria stood at 1.1 million metric tonnes in 2012, 1.50million metric tonnes in 2015, 1.56million metric tonnes in 2016, and 1.6 million metric tonnes in 2017. Local production of sugar on the other hand, stands at a paltry 25,000 metric tonnes as at 2016, rising by 85.34 per cent from 13,488mt in the previous year. As part of efforts to boost local production, the government introduced 20 per cent import duty and 75 per cent levy on refined sugar this year. Also, raw sugar quotas at the concessionary tariff of 5per cent duty and five per cent levy were allocated by  NSDC to operators on the basis of performance of their BIP projects. It was gathered that part of the incentives to boost domestic production of sugar include a five-year tax for investors in the value chain; 10 per cent import duty and 50 per cent levy on imported raw sugar; 20 per cent duty and 60 per cent levy for imported refined sugar. However, investigation revealed that? domestic production by sugar firms has decreased by 6.25 per cent from 80,000 metric tonnes to 75,000 tonnes per cent since 2019 due to lack of infrastructure to meet local demand. Mostly affected recently is Sunti Golden Sugar Estate (SGSE), owned by Flour Mills, which has suffered some disruptions to its operations as floodwater breached its sugar estate. According to the Company’s Secretary, Umolu Joseph, the floods were as a result of the long rainfalls recorded recently at the northern and central parts of the Niger basin. He stressed? that the floods were triggered by severe downpours at the Sokoto Rima basin, forcing the Kainji and Jeba dams ? to witness ? upsurge in the lateral flow of water. Umolu added that the company had suffered some disruptions to operations, as the resulting high inflows in the downstream Niger River caused a breach to the extensive and properly designed dyke systems at Sunti Golden Sugar Estates (SGSE). The company secretary feared that the development might delay the expansion project geared towards increasing the area under cultivation to 4,000 hectares by mid-2021. It would be recalled that In January 2013, three refineries were approved by NSDC, under BIP and operators were made to sign formal commitments, detailing a number of indicators by which their performance would be measured. The Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA)’s shipping position indicated that two ships have arrived at Lagos Port? this week to offload 96,500 metric tonnes of raw sugar. At the Greenview Developmet Nigeria Limited? (GDNL), Kirana Naree arrived with 46,000tonnes, while Genco Brittany is?laden with46,500tonnes. Already, a total of 194, 050 tonnes had been discharged by four vessels at Apapa Bulk Terminal Limited (ABTL) and Greenview Nigeria Development Limited (GNDL) last month. SBI Bravo ofloaded 49,000tonnes, Almasi, 46,400tonnes and Genco Provence, 46300tonnes have been moored at GDNL, while Desert Hope discharged 52, 350tonnes at ABTL of the port. Investigation has shown that in June this year, a total of 138, 115 tonnes of the commodity was ferried by three vessels to Lagos Port complex, with Hinoki laden with 46,900tonnes; Spar Mira, 46,500 tonnes and Aruna Ece, 44,715 tonnes
