The National Open University of Nigeria (NOUN) is scheduled to resume normal academic activities tomorrow after six months of break following the COVID-19 lockdown. The Director, Media and Publicity, NOUN, Mr. Ibrahim Sheme, said the decision to resume normal academic activities followed the recent decision of the Federal Government on the re-opening of all academic institutions. The institution suspended all academic activities on March 20, 2020 following the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in the country. All members of staff were directed to resume duty tomorrow and asked to strictly abide by all the known COVID-19 safety protocols while at work. Sheme quoted the university Registrar, Mr. Felix Edoka, as saying breach of COVID-19 protocols would not be tolerated. He said: “It is noteworthy that NOUN students were able to continue with their studies from home during the six-month lockdown. “The university, being an Open and Distance Learning (ODL) institution, requires no classroom attendance.”
