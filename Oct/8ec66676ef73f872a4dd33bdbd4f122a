The Minority Caucus in the House of Representatives on Wednesday said shooting of defenseless citizens by security agents cannot be justified or condoned under any rule or guise whatsoever.” The minority lawmakers condemned Tuesday shooting of “peaceful and unarmed” protesters by suspected security operatives at Lekki Toll Gate and other parts of the country. In a statement by the Minority Leader, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu, the lawmakers said “such wicked act of extra-judicial killing of defenseless citizens, by suspected agents of the state, cannot be justified or condoned under any rule or guise whatsoever.” He said “As lawmakers and representatives of the people, we cannot accept this gruesome execution of our young ones in their own country by security operatives. Life is sacred and no one has the right to terminate the life of another just because he has the apparatus of state power. “Such brazen brutally and defilement of right to life, which is at the center of the on-going protests across the nation, underscores the demand for an immediate and total overhaul of our nation’s security architecture. “We therefore call on President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately order the arrest and prosecution of officers involved in the Lekki killing as well as the withdrawal of soldiers from engaging protesters.” Elumelu stressed the urgent need for President Buhari to rejig the nation’s security architecture through extensive reforms and urgent replacing of the service chiefs with more competent and professional hands to assist in effectively handling of the security challenges confronting the nation. He commiserates with the families of the victims of this heinous act and assured of immediate legislative actions that will ensure that justice is served.
