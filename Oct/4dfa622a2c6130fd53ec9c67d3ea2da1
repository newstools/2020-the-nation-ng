 At least five small businesses have been mapped out to benefit from a $500 largesse from the Chief Executive Officer of Brisk Capital, Mr. Dominic Joshua, to boost their respective businesses. The gesture is part of the investment expert’s philanthropic efforts to help emerging businesses stay afloat. Mr. Joshua announced the empowerment programme this week via his verified social media handles, where he noted that small businesses needed every support they could get. He expressed willingness to dole out $100 each to five small businesses, and noted that while selection of the businesses would be at random, a qualifying criterion is that they must have specific problems which they solve. According to him, “Each of the businesses to qualify for this should be able to answer the question: Why does your small business need support?” He added that, “For the remaining part of the year, I would be committed towards empowering five business owners with $100 each every Friday.” The Brisk Capital boss maintained that despite how tough the past couple of months in 2020 have been, small businesses kept pushing and therefore deserved to be supported In a campaign hash tagged #fundsfriday, he said the comment section was opened for small business owners to compete, and that on Fridays, he would have winners selected.
