Austria-born scholar Ruth Klueger, best known for a feminist memoir of her time in Nazi camps, passed away in California, her publisher Zsolnay said on Wednesday in Vienna. Klueger died on Tuesday at the age of 88, following a long illness. When she was in her 60s, Klueger published a best-selling autobiography that was translated into 10 languages, including two English versions titled `Still Alive and Landscapes of Memory’. The memoir provided a feminist perspective on the Holocaust and World War II, as Klueger highlighted how women were targets of Nazi atrocities. The daughter of a Jewish doctor and a nurse, Klueger moved to the U.S. after the war and became a German literature scholar. In 2016, Klueger addressed the German parliament to commemorate the victims of Nazi crimes. In her speech, she said she had accepted the invitation because of Germany’s welcoming stance towards refugees from Syria and elsewhere. “As a Holocaust survivor, she was a convincing and influential woman who stood firmly against anti-Semitism, racism, and xenophobia,’’ Austrian President Alexander van der Bellen said in a statement.
