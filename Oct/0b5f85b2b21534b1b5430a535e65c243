Pandemonium broke out on Wednesday when #ENDSARS protesters stormed the Lugard House Lokoja in Kogi. The youths, who turned out in their hundreds, gathered in front of the Government House and demanded to see the Governor. Efforts by the Chief of Staff to the Governor, Jamiu Asuku, to plead with them Governor Bello was in attendance at the weekly state Executive Council meeting fell on deaf ears. The protesters insisted they will not vacate the front of the government house until the Governor addresses them. As the time of filling this report, Bello was yet to accede to their demand. Spokesperson of the protesting youths, Bernard Ajewole, said the disbandment of SARs is a mere pronouncement with no effect. “What we want is beyond disbandment and replacing it with another. Just yesterday, they came to our campus (Prince Abubakar Audu University) Ayingba in their uniforms where they arrested some students and made them to part with N100, 000 before they were released. “This is happening in spite of the Inspector General’s directives that members of the disbanded SARs should report in Abuja for debriefing. “The youth are gathered here today to give solidarity to fellow youths protesting police brutality across the country. “We want a Nigerian police that is refined enough to tackle various acts of criminality without extra judicial killings,” he said.
