LIVERPOOL defender Virgil van Dijk has had a “successful” operation on his knee ligament injury, the club say. The 29-year-old has not played since damaging anterior cruciate ligaments (ACL) in a challenge with Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford in the 2-2 Premier League draw on 17 October.  Liverpool said “no timeframe has been placed” on Van Dijk’s return. “This time [after an operation] is always unpleasant. He is good as good as can be,” said manager Jurgen Klopp. “The surgery was successful, which is really good, the best news we could get.”
