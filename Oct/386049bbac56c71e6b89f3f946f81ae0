 THE Federal Capital Territory (FCT) is organising a two-day intra-action review workshop in line with the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendations as schools resume after seven months of Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. Acting Secretary of the FCT Health and Human Services Secretariat (HHSS) Dr. Mohammed Kawu stated this in a statement issued yesterday. Kawu said the intra-action review is critical at this point to enable relevant stakeholders to collectively evaluate the current response approach to identify challenges, adopt best practices and re-strategise for improved response.  According to him, the review meeting, which is expected to hold between October 13 and 14, “will also help to document lessons learned, share experiences and utilise available evidence to plan for future outbreaks. “One of the key focus of the workshop will be to build consensus among relevant stakeholders with specific target on full decentralisation of the response to the area councils. “Other key targets of the review meeting include improving community engagement and participation in the response, sustaining safety measures in FCT schools, improving enforcement of preventive measures and integrating the distribution of palliatives with response activities.”
