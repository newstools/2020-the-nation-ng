The Western Naval Command (WNC) has tested ships and platforms within its jurisdiction for their capability and functionality. The exercise which was part of the Flag Officer Commanding’s (FOC) bi-annual inspection tour, saw the deployed vessels navigating blue and brown waters covering the entire stretch of Lagos, Ogun and Ondo States. FOC, Rear Admiral Oladele Daji said the sea exercise preceded inspection of units and formations ashore aimed at vetting the overall operational preparedness of the command. “We went round all the units under the WNC from Badagry, Lagos, Imeri, and we capped it up with the inspection of the ships at sea,” he said.
