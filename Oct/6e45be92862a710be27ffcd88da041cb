Lewis Hamilton won for a record-breaking 92nd time in Formula 1 to become the driver with the most race wins in history yesterday at the Portuguese Grand Prix. Two weeks after equalling the huge haul of 91 wins set by Michael Schumacher in 2006, Hamilton now holds the prestigious record outright with a victory that moves him potentially just two more races away from drawing level with the German great as a seven-time world champion. Hamilton leads the Drivers’ Championship by 77 points with five races to go and just 130 points left to play for. “I could never have dreamed of being where I am today,” said Hamilton, who shared an embrace with his father Anthony after the race. “I didn’t have a magic ball when I chose to come to this team and partner with great people, but here I am and what I can tell you is I’m trying to make the most of it every single day. It’s going to take some time to sink in.”  Hamilton ultimately won by a dominant 25 seconds from Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas on F1’s Portimao debut but was made to work for it in the first 20 laps after dropping from first to third in a dramatic start to the race. Earlier,  the Six-times Formula One world champion  had  donned a T-shirt protesting against police violence in Nigeria for the pre-race television interview. “I’ve got to show this,” Hamilton, Formula One’s only Black driver, told Sky Sports as he revealed a green T-shirt with #EndSARS written on it at the end of the off-grid interview. The Briton reverted to his usual ‘Black Lives Matter’ T-shirt for the officially-sanctioned pre-race anti-racism gesture on the starting grid. He wrote on his Twitter handle:  “We all have a responsibility to educate ourselves and raise awareness of the tragedies happening in the world around us and take action where we can. The recent events in Nigeria are a human rights crisis.”
