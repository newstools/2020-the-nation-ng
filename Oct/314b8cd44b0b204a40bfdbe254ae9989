The Delta Police Command confirmed the development to The Nation on Friday evening. It was gathered policemen in vans drove around the Ughelli metropolis, in the early parts of Friday, combing flashpoints for the “killer protesters.” The development reportedly caused tension across the town as residents were said to have scampered for safety.
