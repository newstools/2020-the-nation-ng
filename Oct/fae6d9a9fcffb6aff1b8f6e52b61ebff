An 11-year-girl was on Thursday raped to death in Lagos. Five suspects have been arrested by police in connection with the incident. It was gathered that the victim, Favour Okechukwu, was gang-raped until she died in a shack in the Power Line area of Ejigbo community. Sources said the assault on the 11-year-old may have started on Wednesday afternoon and ended about 6am on Thursday when she reportedly passed away. The incident was reported at Ejigbo Police Station where sources said five men have been arrested, including the owner of the shack where the body was discovered. President, International Charitable  Initiative  for Girl Child and Women Development  Foundation (ICI-WODEF), Mrs Helen Ibeji told The Nation that the girl came back from school on Wednesday and was asked by her mother to buy a carton of sausages, the last time the girl was seen alive. Ibeji said when the girl did not return from from the errand, her parents started looking for her. Her body was found in the shack stark naked. It was gathered that police invited officials of the Lagos State DNA & Forensic Centre (LSD&FC) who took the body away for forensic analysis. Chairman of Ejigbo council Mudashiru Obe expressed shock and sadness over the incident when he visited the scene. Obe and Ibeji have appealed to security agencies to fish out the perpetrators of the crime and bring them to book.
