 MEMBER of the Lagos State House of Assembly representing Ikeja Constituency II, Adedamola Kasunmu has said a vital lesson learnt from the #EndSARS protest was that young people need tact, insight and more wisdom to achieve the great Nigeria of their dream. Kasunmu appealed to the youth to seize the formidable platform provided by #EndSARS to build a better country. He said this at the yearly Constituency Stakeholders’ meeting held in all the 40 constituencies in the state. The lawmaker said: “There is great hope for our country if the people can come together and form a united, positive and patriotic coalition”. He said his support for the protest was total but that it was unfortunate that an otherwise “peaceful and innovative protest was hijacked by enemies of good things who unleashed coordinated terror on our state”. Also speaking at the Surulere  venue, Desmond Elliot who expressed excitement in the brave move of the youths, in the #ENDSARS protest, described the protest as a wake up signal that shows the youth are ready to be involved in governance. He regretted the destruction that trailed the protest in Surulere, assuring that the Assembly will push for compensation from the state government. Sympathising with those who lost persons and property, Elliot appealed to everyone to remain calm and embrace peace and dialogue. At the Epe II Constituency, Sylvester Ogunkelu urged his constituents to adapt to the new’ normal’ in the face of changing socio-economic situation occasioned by first the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent devastation in the state by hoodlums.
