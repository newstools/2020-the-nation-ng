President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed sadness over the death of scores of Nigerians, mostly school pupils, in the auto crash in Enugu state on Thursday. In a statement issued by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr Femi Adesina, the President particularly commiserated with the Catholic Church of Awgu, the operators of Presentation Nursery and Primary School, which pupils were killed in the crash. “President Muhammadu Buhari is saddened by the gruesome vehicle accident in Mgbowu, Awgu Local Government Area of Enugu State, in which scores of people died, most of them school pupils. “The President condoles with families and kith and kin of the dead, praying that God will grant them succour, and spare the country of such tragedy in future. “He also commiserates with the Catholic Church of Awgu, which runs Presentation Nursery and Primary School that the pupils attended, and the Enugu State government. “President Buhari enjoins vehicle owners to ensure roadworthiness, as initial reports attributed the accident to brake-failure by the truck involved,” the statement said.
