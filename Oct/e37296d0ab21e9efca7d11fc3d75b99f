Ondo State Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has promised to work towards developing all parts of the state, irrespective of political differences. He said last Saturday’s victory at the polls belonged to the people. Akeredolu spoke Tuesday at the Akure office of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) after he and his running mate, Lucky Aiyedatiwa, received their Certificate of Return from the electoral body. The governor polled 292,830 votes to defeat his closest rival, Eyitayo Jegede of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who got 195,791 votes. Akeredolu said his administration would ensure equal development across the 18 local governments. He said he would treat local governments equally whether they voted for him or not. The All Progressives Congress (APC) standard-bearer hailed INEC for successful conduct of free, fair and credible election. He said: “It’s a victory that a few things have been established for generations to come. We have made a statement. No one has ever won with 50 per cent. We won with over 51 per cent. “Our re-election was a divine project. I assure the people that we will serve them in a way that they have never seen before.“ INEC chairman represented by the Supervising National Commissioner, Dr. Adekunle Ladipo Ogunmola, said the electoral umpire was committed to deepening democracy.
