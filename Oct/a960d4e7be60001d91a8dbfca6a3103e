Dr. Anderson Oseh, the Vice Principal, Administration, Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Education Board, School Service Division has advocated for the use of information communication technology to combat sex for marks. Oseh said this during a virtual session on Tuesday in Abuja on the role of advocacy in the fight against sex for marks in the nation’s tertiary institutions and secondary schools. According to him, using technology will enhance and make the exam system more credible and drastically reduce the incidence of intimidation and sex for marks in higher institutions in the country. The principal stressed the need for continuous advocacy to reverse the negative trend that had plagued the education system in the country. Oseh emphasised the need for parents to inculcate the right moral upbringing and early advocacy in senior secondary schools. He said it would help teenagers transition into higher institutions of learning to be better equipped with the right knowledge to handle sex predators in their respective institutions. He said there was also a need to partner the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASSU) and other organisations within the university community, adding that it would provide a united front in the fight against the vice. The Coordinator, `Sofadondo’ Abuja chapter, Mr. Olamide Oni, commended the Nigerian Senate on the passage of the Sexual Harassment Bill. He expressed worry over ASSU’s vehemently opposing the bill, citing infringement on its autonomy. Mr Nengak Daniel, a participant at the event expressed worries over the downward quality of degrees obtained in higher institutions, adding that this was partly due to the problem of sex for marks. Daniel alleged that the situation had affected some Nigerian students when applying for further studies abroad.  (NAN)
