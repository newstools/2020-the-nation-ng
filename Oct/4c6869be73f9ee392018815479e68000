Iran does not care who will take the office in Washington in the upcoming U.S. presidential election in November, Iran’s Foreign Ministry Spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said on Monday. What matters is “Washington should reverse its hostile policies against Tehran,” Khatibzadeh told Tasnim news agency. “The UN Security Council Resolution 2231 and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (the JCPOA),” should be honoured by the U.S., Khatibzadeh was quoted as saying. Besides, Washington should admit its mistakes of policies vis-a-vis Iran, stop the “economic war and terrorism” against Iran, return to its JCPOA commitments, and make up for the damage caused by its withdrawal from the Iranian 2015 nuclear deal, he stressed. Earlier, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Zarif also said that “it is not important for us who will win the upcoming election in the U.S., but it is important for us to see Washington rectify its approach towards Tehran.” (Xinhua/NAN)
