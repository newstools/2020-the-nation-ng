2scale, an international incubator programme that manages a portfolio of public-private partnerships (PPPs) for inclusive business in agri-food sectors and industries, has launched its crowd farming platform. The programme offers support services to its business champions (SMEs and farmer groups) and partners, enabling them to produce, transform and supply quality food products. It said it launched a crowdfunding website to support its partners in agribusiness value chains to mobilise funds from their networks in this difficult period. Crowdfunding raises funds for a business by asking a large group of people to contribute small amounts of money. An online crowdfunding campaign mobilises one’s network, creating a community and gaining support for your venture. By involving the family, friends and other networks, you can create a snowball effect and successfully campaign to crowdfund for your venture. The 2SCALE Programme Director, Henk van Duijn, said for the first campaign, about 10 small and medium-sized enterprises are selected in three countries of intervention of the programme, namely Kenya, Mali and Nigeria. Each company will be coached and supported by experts to activate its network to mobilise €5,000. According to 2SCALE Country Team Leader of Mali, Baba Togola, the initiative represents a great opportunity for their partners to promote self-employment through support for SMEs to acquire the means (working capital or acquisition of equipment) for the development of their business. It added that any company that will mobilise 50 per cent of the targeted resources would benefit from a financial bonus of €2000 from 2SCALE.
