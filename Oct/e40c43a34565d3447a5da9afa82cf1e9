The arrested suspects, who were immediately charged to the Chief Magistrate Court Monday evening after they were paraded before journalist, include a woman. Parading the suspects, the Police Command’s Public Relations Officer, (PPRO), ASP Muhammed Jalige, said the suspects had already been investigated which informed the decision to charge them to court. Jalige said: “Following the trend of the #EndSARS protest in the country and the subsequent hijacking of the protest by hoodlums and the consequent looting and destruction of both public and private property across many states of the federation, Kaduna State inclusive, the Kaduna State Govermment imposed a 24 hours curfew with a view to curb the criminal activities of the miscreants. “The imposition of the curfew placed the responsibility of enforcement on the Police and other sister security agencies. “In view of this, the Command has succeeded in arresting 25 suspects for criminal conspiracy, vandalisation and looting of public and private property. The operation is still ongoing alongside other security agencies in the State.” He said items recovered from the suspects include; bags of mosquito coil, Air conditioners, 29 grains, bags of fertiliser, microwave machine, burglary irons, 2 bags of sugar, 3 bags of soya beans, 2 cartons cough syrup, aluminum windows panels, mobile telephones and roofing sheets, among others. Vehicles, motorcycle, tricycles, which were used as means of conveyance of the looted items, were also recovered from the suspects.
