Two tankers exploded at the popular Otedola Bridge in Lagos Saturday morning. The Lagos State Emergency Management Agency after responding to distress calls from the area, said a 40fit containerized truck loaded with fabric had a brake failure while moving inward Berger. The truck then collided with a tanker loaded with 33000 liters of PMS which resulted in a fire outbreak.
