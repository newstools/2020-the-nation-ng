 Belgium-born Cyril Dessers, Russia-based Chidera Ejuke and goalkeeper Matthew Yakubu may make their debut for the Super Eagles in tonight’s international friendly against Tunisia at the Jacques Lemans Arena in the Austrian city of St. Veit an der Glan. The trio were not part of the run-out with Algeria on Friday night where Zaidu Sanusi, Kevin Akpoguma, Frank Onyeka and Samson Tijani all made their debut for Gernot Rohr’s team. Meanwhile, the German coach admits the absence of a number of first-team players somewhat weakened the texture of his band, but has challenged the squad to up the ante and show vibrancy especially in the fore against the 2004 African champions. Nigeria had capped four new players against the African champions, with midfield dependable Wilfred Ndidi, Joseph Ayodele-Aribo and Oghenekaro Etebo, as well as forward Victor Osimhen unavailable. “We definitely must put up a greater effort against the Tunisians,” the ex- Bayern Munich defender stressed. “It is an opportunity for some of the players to rise up to the occasion, stake a claim. “They are ready to go and I believe we would see a much better game on Tuesday (today).” Incidentally, Tunisia have not beaten Nigeria in a competitive game since the 2004 AFCON that they hosted, when they edged the Super Eagles on penalty shoot-out after both teams tied 1-1 in regulation and extra time at the Stade Olympique in Rades, outside Tunis.
