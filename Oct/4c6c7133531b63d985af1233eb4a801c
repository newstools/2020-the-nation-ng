According to her: “They came at about 8:30pm and started knocking forcefully at the door while my husband was in the inner room. I moved close to the door to see who was knocking only to discover that they were heavily armed men. “When I noticed they were armed men, I quickly tried to close the door, shouting for help before my husband came to join me in the struggle to close the door, even as they were dragging to force themselves into the parlour. “My husband rushed to the door and we succeeded in closing the door but the gunmen kept pushing until they succeeded in using some objects in breaking the doors and wall to gain entrance”.
