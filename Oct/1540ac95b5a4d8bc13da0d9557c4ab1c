WHEN Real Madrid need a saviour, they turn to Sergio Ramos. The captain is already an icon, and his legend keeps getting bigger with time. The Spaniard was vital for Madrid at both ends of the pitch in their title run-in last season and proved decisive again on Saturday, crucially converting from the penalty spot to put his side back in front in a massive 3-1 victory over Barcelona at Camp Nou. The Clasico started emphatically with both Real Madrid and Barcelona scoring inside the first 10 minutes. It was Real Madrid who got the lead when Karim Benzema slipped a delicate pass to Valverde on the right, who took a touch and smashed the ball past Neto into the top left corner. However, Madridâ€™s lead remained only for three minutes. Barcelona responded with Messi releasing the ball to Jordi Alba on the left flank, who beat the offside trap. He raced down the flank with the ball and crossed it low to Fati, who made a smart run in the centre and the 17-year-old calmly slotted the ball home. Thereafter, both Messi and Benzema each had big chances to put their teams in the lead but good saves from both Neto and Thibaut Courtois denied them. At half time, the teams went locked at 1-1.
