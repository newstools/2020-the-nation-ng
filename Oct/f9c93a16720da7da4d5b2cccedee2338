 NIGERIA’S SSC Napoli  striker  Victor Osimhen has been described as a striker with strong character and remarkable maturity by the influential  Italian tabloid, La Gazzetta dello Sport. The 21-year-old has featured in only two  Serie A matches since joining Napoli from Lille but La Gazzetta dello Sport claimed the player’s strong character  and disposition to learning would serve him in good stead with Gil Azzurri. “No attitudes of a star or a kid and so he accepted the cloister to learn,” stated the Italian news outlet. “Trusting ‘dad ‘ Gattuso, who reserves great attention to him, and joking with his companions, especially those who speak English. “ It continued: “Osimhen is one of the most attentive to see and review the customized clips that Gattuso’s technical staff has prepared for each of their players, divided by role and department. “The Nigerian is discovering with great curiosity the importance given to tactics in our championship. La Gazzetta dello Sport  also hinted that the Nigeria is already preparing  ahead of his sides’  game  against Atalanta this weekend , describing him as a fast learner :“Osimhen takes the opportunity when he can to understand how Atalanta’s action starts and how he will have to press to recover the ball high and make Napoli’s attacking action even more dangerous. “The Nigerian striker was unable to leave to dispute the commitments of his national team, but like everyone else he remained in the Castel Volturno bubble, where he learns more about Italian football day after day.” “Three  players started a game with us for the first  time; and two of them are doing very well and one needs still a little time to adapt,” he noted.
