Kubrat Pulev sparked accusations of racism ahead of his world heavyweight title fight with Anthony Joshua by claiming his ‘tan is better than mine’. The 39-year-old Bulgarian will battle it out with Joshua for his WBA, IBF and WBO titles, with the fight expected to take place on December 12 after it was initially postponed due to the Covid-19 outbreak. And ahead of the pair’s upcoming title fight, Pulev was asked about his verdict on Joshua – in which he made a controversial comment about his opponent’s skin colour. “His strengths? I’d say he has a very powerful punch undeniably,” said Pulev during a press conference. “What are his other strengths? His tan is better than mine.”  Joshua – who is of Nigerian and Irish ancestry – has been a big advocate of the Black Lives Matter movement in the fight against racism in society. Joshua even delivered a powerful speech as he showed his support for the movement when he joined a protest march in his hometown of Watford. The world champion joined hundreds of others in the peaceful protest. And following Pulev’s comments regarding Joshua, many boxing fans let their feelings be known on social media. After hearing what Pulev said, one fan wrote: “That’s a shameful 1970s comment. Awful.” “Kubrat Pulev sadly proves why #BlackLivesMatter is needed. Idiot!”, another boxing follower said on Twitter. And the condemnation of the Bulgarian’s comments kept on coming on social media.
