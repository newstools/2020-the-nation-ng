Tsanyawa in a press conference assured that about 3,810,920 doses of vaccine were available to satisfactorily take care of the targeted kid population. “All preparations for the round had been completed before the vaccination started yesterday. I therefore, urge parents to gain this opportunity and immense benefit by bringing out their children to be immunised,” he said. He expressed delight that Kano State has been free of poliomyelitis for six years now, explaining that the routine immunisation embarked in Kano is a reliable and polio-free sustainability plan.
He reaffirmed government commitment towards healthcare delivery in Kano, ensuring that all eligible children must be immunised through various programmes.
