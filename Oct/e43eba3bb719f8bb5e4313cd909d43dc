Youths participating in the #ENDSARS protest have shut down the country’s second-largest Port, the Onne Port Complex in Rivers State. It was gathered that the protest affected the Federal Ocean Terminal, the Federal Lighter Terminal, the Onne Oil and Gas Free Zone, Intels Services, Prodeco, the Nigerian Naval Vollwge, and other oil and marine servicing firms operating in the area. The angry youths were said to have defied heavy downpour on Monday to block the F.O.T. Junction causing gridlock on the Onne – East/West Road. They displayed flags and placards with #EndSars messages, lamented police brutality, and urged the government to ensure justice for persons killed by the disbanded SARS. The youths also demanded employment, empowerment, and social amenities from the companies operating in the area. Police operatives and other security agents were deployed in the area to monitor the protest. The protesters reportedly took time off to play football, sing, dance, and treat themselves to a lunch of boiled yam and goat meat pepper soup.
