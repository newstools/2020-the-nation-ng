Federal lawmaker representing Idanre/Ifedore federal constituency, Hon. Tajudeen Adefisoye has trained no fewer than 100 selected from his constituency in modern fish farming. He also assured funds would be provided to help the newly trained fish farmers set up their farms. The beneficial youths were trained in Idanre for free by a group of resourceful experts that specialise in modern fish farming. The trainees were also presented with certificates of participation after the three- day training. Adefisoye said the gestures were in fulfilment of his promise to roll out different training and empowerment programmes for the youths in his constituency. “The youths have been trained in fish farming and they will be given funds to start up. However, we are going to monitor their commitment and level of productivity before releasing another tranche of fund to them to further boost their production”. The Deputy Chapman House Committee on Army also urged the trainees to justify the resources invested in them by capitalising maximally on the opportunities in fish farming business. “I can confidently assure that greater days are ahead for the people, especially the youths. But it is important to impress it on the trainees that they must justify the resources we have committed to this training as well as the financial empowerment. This is just the only way we can be encouraged to do more for others”. Speaking on behalf of the trainees, Ayodele Ogo thanked Adefisoye and assured they would take maximum advantage of the empowerment programme. He said: “We are thankful to Hon. Tajudeen Adefisoye for fulfilling his promise to train us in fish farm. We are more grateful to him for the assurance of start up fund. “This is a lawmaker that has done what his predecessors never thought was good for the youths. “He has practically given us fish and has also thought us how to fish. He has truly made a positive impact in our lives and he could always count on our support any time.”
