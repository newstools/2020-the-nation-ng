President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo have urged Ondo voters to massively choose candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Oluwarotimi Akeredolu in Saturdayâ€™s governorship poll. Buhari, who virtually addressed the crowd at the mega rally of the APC, said he has taken interest in the Ondo APC campaign. The President, who hailed governorship aspirants for accepting outcome of the APC primaries, also commended what he termed selfless conducts of South West APC leaders. Buhari said the party has a good brand in Akeredolu and expressed delight at his performance. Buhari stated that Akeredolu has taken Ondo to a new level and path of prosperity. He said Akeredolu deserved to be re-elected and urged the electorates to vote without fear of molestation. Osibanjo, on his part, said Akeredolu constructed the Ore interchange flyover, which he said has stopped accidents on Ore highway.
