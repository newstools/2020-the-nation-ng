One person was feared dead as hoodlums wreaked havoc in the Ogolonto Roundabout area of Ikorodu, Lagos on Sunday. The Nation learnt that the violence followed a clash between Ogolonto and Idiroko youths. The youths, wielding cutlasses, knives and broken bottles, smashed vehicles, robbed passers-by and blocked the Ikorodu Expressway at Obasekumade Junction. A sea of shards of glass littered the road following the exchange of missiles of bottles taken from two nearby soft drinks depots. A video shared by Twitter user Series Abiodun showed some of the wailing residents of the area carrying the body of a youth. The hoodlums, positioned on either side of the roundabout, took advantage of the clash to rob unsuspecting members of the public of their valuables. One of the youths, welding a broken bottle, seized The Nation reporter’s phone and only returned it after obtaining N1,000. A witness, who identified himself as Kalu, told The Nation that the violence had been ongoing on and off on since last week. Another witness, Shade Fabiyi, said she saw the hoodlums attacking a girl last Tuesday evening. “They threatened her with a cutlass and collected her phone,” she said. When The Nation left the area, the hoodlums were still extorting passers-by at illegal tolls. They also prevented vehicular coming into or going out of Ikorodu.
