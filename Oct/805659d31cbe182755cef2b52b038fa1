 Rangers assistant Gary McAllister  and former England international Jermain Defoe have both  praised Joe Aribo after the Super Eagles midfielder netted his  first goal for Rangers FC  in the current  season. McAllister  said the Nigerian still has a lot to offer after returning from a six-week lay-off due to injury. “We are all big fans of Joe Aribo here,” he said, as quoted by  Glasgow Times. “I think he has been missed. Visually, he looks in a good place as far as where his body shape is.” He continued: “He is in great nick. He has probably put a wee bit of muscle on his upper body. We expect big things from Joe.  He’s a very talented player. And he can play in two or three different positions. We are pleased to get him back on the pitch.” Following substitute appearances against Celtic and Standard Liege, Aribo made his first start in over two months against Livingstone at Ibrox on Sunday much to the delight of his teammates. Defoe who netted his 300th career goal has described Aribo  as a quality player despite weeks of lay-off as he  dazzled  in their 2-0 win over Livingston in the Scottish Premier League (SPL). “Joe [Aribo] did well as well following a long lay-off with injury but it was a good win and we are delighted,” Defoe said.
