 FRENCH-CANADIAN-NIGERIAN, Töme, has featured international act, Sean Kingston in one of her three new singles. Following the release of her 2020 album, ‘Bigger Than 4 Walls,’ Töme has released a three-song pack titled ‘I Pray.’  Speaking of his collaboration with Töme, Sean Kingston said, “Töme is an incredibly unique artist with a beautiful voice, I really vibed with this song and I respect the fact that she is an independent Afro artist on the rise. I’m happy to be a part of a record the world truly needs right now.” This gospel-tinged body of work features Töme singing over warm guitar riffs in English on the original song, in French on a remix, and trading verses with Sean Kingston on another remix with a distinct spry patois cadence that accentuates her flow and makes her case more sturdy and resonant.
