The last may not have been heard of the alleged scandal against former Minister of State for Education Olorogun Kenneth Gbagi. Office of the Inspector General of Police, through the Monitoring Unit in an October 5 letter signed by Nuhu Hamidu (CSP), has invited masterminds of the video for interrogation. The Urhobo high chief was alleged to have ordered the making of a video showing the stripping of four of his workers with Signatious Hotels and Suites at Warri in Delta State, over alleged theft. In another twist, he petitioned the IGP, Abubakar Adamu, accusing a top commissioner in the state of being part of the conspiracy against him with regards to the video, which had gone viral. He told the police chief that the commissioner was one of those behind the video, purportedly to cast him in bad light in a vicious campaign of calumny, blackmail and character assassination against his person and business empire, to destroy him and thwart his ambition to succeed Governor Ifeanyi Okowa in 2023.
