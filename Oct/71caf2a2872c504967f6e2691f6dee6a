 A non-governmental organisation (NGO), the 60-plus Advocacy Initiative, has commended the Lagos state government for its pension reform initiative, programmes and facilities set up for the benefit of the elderly, saying it has ended their hardship in the state. Chairman of the  NGO’s  governing council, Adeyinka Obalade, gave the commendation while speaking with journalists after a closed door meeting with Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu at the Lagos House, Marina, Lagos. The 60-plus Advocacy Initiative was set up to promote the interests of the elderly in Nigeria, Obalade said, adding that the state government’s pension reform initiative has removed the hardship pensioners in the state used to face in the past.  Obalade told newsmen that Sanwo-Olu who he described as an amiable person, promised during the meeting to do more for the elderly. He noted that the state needs to set up more relaxation centres, cheaper transportation and easier access to healthcare facilities for the elderly. Obalade disclosed that the group had consulted extensively and discovered that the aged are not accorded their due respect in the society, a situation which he said the Advocacy group is set to remedy. Members of the 60-plus Advocacy Initiative include prominent retired citizens from  across the federation.
