On Thursday, October 15, the kingdom of Oyo will come alive as family and friends celebrate Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi. The top monarch, who will clock 82 years, has proven to all and sundry that age is just a number, as he remains quite agile. It even came as a shock when the king married a new wife recently. As expected, the palace will be flooded with people from all walks of life with gifts and special wishes. Last year, his birthday celebration kicked off with an interdenominational service held by major churches and religious bodies in Oyo to honour him. Royal fathers across Yorubaland also stormed the ancient town to celebrate with the respected king. Oba Adeyemi was seen dancing to the traditional talking drum and “sekere,” as excited indigenes gathered at the palace to join him.
