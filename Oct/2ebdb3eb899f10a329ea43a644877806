Ahead of the November 18 governorship election in Anambra State, the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) has handed its ticket to former Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo. But the party’s State Chairman Norbert Obi described the development as fake news A chieftain of the party, who spoke in confidence with The Nation in Awka, the state capital, said APGA decided to hand the ticket to Soludo because the party believed he is the only person who can win the election for the party. The source also said the obstacle Soludo was facing in the hands of one of most powerful persons in the state had been cleared and the person had given the nod for him to sail with the party. Though, according to the source, the party had stopped all groups from campaigning for anyone as campaigns had not begun, he said some people were working underground for Soludo to carry the APGA flag. But Obi said APGA was making sure that it followed the party’s guidelines. The chairman said three persons had shown interest in the governorship ticket, including Soludo, adding that by January, things will become clearer. Other aspirants, according to Obi, are Sir Damian Okolo, from Nnewi and Sullivan Nwankpo, from Okija He said: “APGA has not chosen anybody; never mind the rumour-mongers. People have interest in representing the party, but we should exercise patience till early next year. I hope other names will still emerge. “APGA is a solid party and a mass movement. Other political parties are just queuing behind it, as far as Anambra State is concerned. We don’t believe in noise-making. All I want to say is that we are ready for the election.”
