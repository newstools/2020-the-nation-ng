Traditional ruler of Nnewi, Anambra State, HRH, Igwe Kenneth Orizu III has expressed worry over the burning and vandalisation of police stations and other security formations in the area. He warned those who burnt and carted away arms and other property in the formations in the industrial city to return the loot or face the consequences. Orizu who spoke through the Crown Prince, Obi said the leaders in the area were carrying out intelligence gathering on how to fish out who and where the looters were to plead with them or otherwise for the recovery. He explained that he was not against the protest as it was nation-wide to address a nagging issue that bordered on police brutality but could not understand why the property of the community would be destroyed in the name protest.
