THE 2020 edition of the Prudent Energy Handball Premier League will be holding at the MKO Abiola Stadium (Package B) from 23rd October to Nov 6, 2020 following the approval of the Federal Ministry of Youth And Sports Development on Friday. The Handball Federation of Nigeria had been working closely with the Federal Ministry of Youth And Sports to ensure that the date was a reality and this necessitated the ministry to approve the request of HFN to organise the Prudent Energy Handball League this month.  In a letter signed by the Ministry’s permanent secretary, Gabriel Aduda and addressed to the HFN president Mr. Sam Ocheho, the commencement of the league was approved in recognition of HFN’s plan put in place in readiness for the league which is in strict adherence to the Covid 19 Sports Protocols. The Premier League 2020 will only be in a single phase this year with the teams playing round-robin games amongst themselves and the winners emerging in the men and women category respectively.
