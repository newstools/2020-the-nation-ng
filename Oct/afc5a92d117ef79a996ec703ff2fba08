 ENUGU State has sustained its outstanding performance at the annual President’s Teachers and Schools Excellence Award (PTSEA). The Principal of Urban Girls’ Secondary School, Enugu, Mrs. Chioma Ebue, was the first Runner-Up (Best Administrator in Junior Secondary School category in Nigeria) at the 2020 edition of the event at Eagle Square, Abuja, to mark Teachers’ Day celebration. Model Secondary School, Nsukka, also in Enugu State, during the 2019 edition of the PTSEA, was the fifth best school in public category in Nigeria. This followed the general assessment of infrastructure, e-library, quality teaching and learning in public secondary schools in the country by the Federal Ministry of Education. The outstanding feat, according to the Executive Chairman of Enugu State Post-Primary Schools Management Board (PPSMB), Nestor Ezeme, who received the award on behalf of the school, was the result of various educational interventions by Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi’s administration. Ezenme said these ensured the overhaul of all classroom blocks at Model Secondary School, Nsukka, construction of dormitories and dining hall with modern facilities. Other pivotal interventions, according to the PPSMB chairman, include “installation of ICT/E-Library through the works department of the Post Primary Schools Management Board (PPSMB) and recruitment and training of quality teachers, leading to excellent performance of the school’s JSS3 and SS3 students in junior and senior WAEC, respectively, among others”.
