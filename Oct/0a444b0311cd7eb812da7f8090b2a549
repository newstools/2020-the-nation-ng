Avoid  cultism, it can  destroy your  future. You all should ask yourselves why you are here, which is for you to read, attend lectures, attempt all forms of assignment and do what  will surely result in  good grades,” he said. The Rector, while congratulating the students,   explained  that out of 13,974 students who applied for the ND program only 3,070 were  admitted and of the 5,517 who  applied for HND  only 2,920 gained admission. While addressing the matriculants, he noted  that  incomplete registration would give most students problem during the process of graduation. He advised all students to be careful while registering and that  they should always give accurate information. Prof. Adebiyi  noted  that appropriate dressing and good  morals were the hallmark of   good students.
