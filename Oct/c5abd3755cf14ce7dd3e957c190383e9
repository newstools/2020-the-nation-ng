 NIGERIA and Napoli forward Victor Osimhen notched his first goal in Serie A in the 4-1 beating of Atalanta, yesterday, and got the praise of Gennaro Gattuso after their third win of the season. Osimhen sealed the hosts’ 4-1 victory over Atalanta at the Stadio Sao Paolo with a 43rd-minute strike. Napoli had a perfect start to the encounter thanks to Mexico star Hirving Lozano’s four-minute brace, in the 23rd and 27th minutes, while Matteo Politano made it 3-0 in the 30th minute. Osimhen then connected with goalkeeper David Ospina’s long ball to break his duck in the Italian top-flight, just two minutes before the break. He celebrated the goal in style as he joined his compatriots in demanding an end to police brutality in Nigeria.  “Clear and deserved victory.” Gennaro Gattuso expresses his satisfaction after the success of Napoli over Atalanta. “We prepared the match very well, I had thought of it just like that, in terms of performance. I didn’t expect a wide result because I know that Atalanta is a very strong team, but I must say that we had a great match.” “I’m happy for Chucky’s brace, but Osimhen’s goal makes me happy because he hadn’t scored so far and he deserved it for the hard work done for the team” “Victor was my wish and I thank the President for having satisfied me. It wasn’t easy but we have bought a player who is very important to us.”
