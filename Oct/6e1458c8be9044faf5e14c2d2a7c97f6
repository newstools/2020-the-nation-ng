 OYO State Governor Seyi Makinde and former Anambra State governor Peter Obi have urged the electorate to vote for the PDP standard-bearer, Eyitayo Jegede, on Saturday. Addressing the Igbo community in Ondo, they said a vote for PDP is a vote for peace, political progress and economic development, adding that voting in Jegede as the governor will result in an all-round development for the state. They expressed confidence in Jegede’s ability to move Ondo State forward, noting that the PDP governorship candidate would draw from his legal and administrative experience to deliver good governance to the people. Ten parties that fielded candidates for the governorship poll have collapsed their structures into the PDP. They are Accord Party, Action Alliance, African Democratic Party, All Progressives Grand Alliance and AAC. Others are APM, APP, NNPP, NRM and Social Democratic Party (SDP). Speaking on behalf of the group, SDP Chairman Dele Ogunbameru said the decision to support Jegede is to ensure the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) is defeated. He said: “Parties participating in Saturday’s poll have resolved to back the PDP candidate, Jegede. “We are committed to good governance, which we believe can only be offered by the PDP at this austere period. “There is no gainsaying that the current political leadership in Ondo State can best be described as nothing but an antenna in the face of things. “This collaboration is an organised effort to save Ondo State from political quagmire and undesirable socio-economic predicament of our people. “The 10 party leaders have resolved to work as a team in tandem with the PDP well captured manifesto for the welfare, well-being and life more abundant for the good people of Ondo State.” Appreciating the parties, PDP Chairman Fatai Adams hailed them for their decision to join the winning train, saying: “Your support is all we need to take Ondo State to a higher level and deliver it from shackles.”
