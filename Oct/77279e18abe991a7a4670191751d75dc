 AIRLINE operators on Monday announced the cancellation of flights today. This followed the imposition of a24-hour curfew by the Lagos State government. Arik Air has cancelled its flight operations for October 21, 2020 due to the curfew. A statement by its spokesman Banji Ola reads: “All booked passengers on the cancelled flights are advised to reschedule their flights for later dates at no extra cost.”  But other airlines are not cancelling all their flights. They said operations would be ongoing in other states where curfew is not imposed. Despite the curfew, the airport or airspace in Lagos is not closed to flights.  A stakeholder, who spoke in confidence, said no legitimate flight would be restricted from operating. “Airlines have the right to either operate or cancel their flights as they deem fit,” he said. A regional airline, Africa World Airlines, also announced the cancelation of its flights for today. Also, Air Peace Limited said it had cancelled its flight operations in Benin and Lagos. The cancellation of flights into the two cities followed the restrictions of movement, following the destruction of properties by hoodlums who hijacked the #EndSARS protests to unleash mayhem.  Azman Air Limited also has put its Lagos-Abuja and Abuja-Kano flights on hold till further notice.
