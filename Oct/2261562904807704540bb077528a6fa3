 THERE was jubilation on Tuesday in Enugu North Senatorial District as Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi inaugurated multiple development projects in some schools in the area. The projects included the solar-powered water boreholes built by his administration at Model Secondary School and Urban Girls’ Secondary School in Nsukka, as well as Girls’ Secondary School at Owerreze-Orba in Udenu Local Government Area. Also inaugurated at the Girls’ Secondary School at Owerreze-Orba were two ultra-modern hostel blocks comprising eight halls, a dining hall with kitchen, 60KVA soundproof electric power generator, renovated 28 classroom blocks and 800-capacity school main hall. At Nsukka, the governor inspected numerous ongoing projects at Command Secondary School, Orba, Udenu Local Government Area, preparatory to its official commencement of academic activities, following its take-over by the military. He expressed delight at the solar-powered boreholes, saying they would address water supply challenges in the schools. Ugwuanyi said this would enable the state to realise the goals of the Enugu State School Water, Sanitisation and Hygiene (WASH) programme. The governor added that the strategic aim of the water projects in the schools was also to stem the tide of hygiene-related infectious diseases, including COVID-19, and to create an environment that is conducive for teaching and learning.
