LIVERPOOL Manager Jurgen Klopp was left fuming and questioning the application of VAR in two pivotal incidents during their 2-2 Merseyside derby draw with Everton at Goodison Park. Klopp queried Jordan Hendersonâ€™s potential winner in added time against 10 men that was ruled out for a barely-perceptible offside decision against Sadio Mane.  He was also at a loss to explain how Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford had not been dismissed and conceded an early penalty for a knee-high challenge on Virgil Van Dijk. Everton came from behind twice to maintain their unbeaten start to the Premier League in a Merseyside derby thriller as Liverpool were denied a stoppage-time winner by the video assistant referee.
