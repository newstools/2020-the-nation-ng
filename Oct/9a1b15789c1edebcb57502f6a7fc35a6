 Lagos State Commission for Housing, Moruf Akinderu-Fatai and Chairman of Oshodi-Isolo Local Government in the state, Idris Bolaji Muse-Ariyoh, have visited the burnt Makinde Police Barracks. The duo was told that hoodlums looted the place before setting it ablaze. Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), who lives in the barracks, said the hoodlums stole and raped his daughter at his apartment before torching the place. “In fact, I have nothing left with me, except for the clothes I am wearing,” he said. Akinderu-Fatai told the officer to liaise with other residents and forward their losses to the council chairman. Muse-Ariyoh consoled parents of 25-year old Victor, Mr. and Mrs. Citalins Ukaegbu, hit by a stray bullet in his mother’s shop at Idera Market, Mafoluku. The council chief assured them that Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu would be told of of their loss. He thanked residents for protecting the council secretariat. He promised that the council and government would renovate the barracks. According to him, Nigerians needed the police. “I have discussed with the police and other security agents. They have assured me of their cooperation to ensure the safety of life and properties,” he said. He advised parents and guardians to prevail on their wards to stop vandalising government property.
