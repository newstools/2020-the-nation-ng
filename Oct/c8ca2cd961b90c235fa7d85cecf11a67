Proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has demanded immediate and unconditional release of its media Head, Mazi Emmanuel Bassey Ekomiba in Akwa Ibom and his colleague, Mazi Victor Sunday Okoro. The group said the duo was arrested in Akwa Ibom during ‘evangelism’ on September 30, 2020. A statement by the Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, IPOB said there was no justification for their arrests, as they were not terrorists or committed any crime. The pro-Biafran group also demanded the unconditional release of all Biafra agitators picked by security agents during the recent sit-at-home order. The statement partly reads: “We want to put the world on notice of the abduction of Mazi Emmanuel Bassey Ekomiba, the media Head of IPOB in Akwa Ibom; and his colleague, Mazi Victor Sunday Okoro, who were abducted in Akwa Ibom during the evangelism on 30th of September 2020. “We demand their immediate release because they are not terrorists nor did they commit anything to warrant any arrest. “We equally demand the unconditional release of all Biafra agitators picked by security agents. We want the Army that besieged the home of our leader at Isiama Afaraukwu on October 1 to stop harassing residents of the area because they are not terrorists. “Buratai should send his soldiers to Sambisa forest, Baga in Borno state and other Northern communities taken over by terrorists. “IPOB is a peaceful movement committed to the peaceful restoration of Biafra. Biafra is a divine project designed by the Most High God in Heaven, and there is nothing anybody can do to change our resolve to actualise Biafra’s independence.”
