The Senator representing Enugu North zone Chukwuka Utazi has said the proposed Proceed of Crime act is an important part of the fight against corruption. Utazi, who chaired the last committee on anti-corruption in the 8th Senate regretted that the bill already passed in the last Senate was unable to complete its journey to becoming an act due to the dissolution of the Federal Executive Council after the 2019 general election.  The Senator, who is now chairman of the Senate Committee on Primary Health Care threw his weight behind the new executive bill on Proceed of Crime which also provides for an Agency to manage seized assets and forfeitures by indicted offenders. Speaking to reporters in his office, Utazi explained the circumstance that led to the non-signing of the bill he sponsored in the last senate: â€œThe issue is that all these anti-graft agencies that prosecute and seize properties are also keeping them.
