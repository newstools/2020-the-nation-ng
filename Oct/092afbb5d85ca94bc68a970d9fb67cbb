Chairman Photo Journalists Association of Nigeria (PJAN) Kola Olasupo has condemned the attack on three of its members, Comrade Jimoh Ayodele, Chief Photojournalist The Nation Newspapers, Abiodun William’s and Mike Otogo of The Economy Magazine by hooligans, under the guise of #EndSARS protest. Olasupo, in a statement, explained Ayodele, who also served as NUJ Lagos Internal Auditor almost lost his life when he was attacked by hoodlums at Mofoluku area of Lagos in the cause of carrying out his official duties. “He was attacked when he went to get the shots of the burnt Makinde Police Station located in the Mafoluku area. “He narrowly escaped after much beating while Abiodun Williams was attacked at Yaba area of Lagos and his camera completely damaged. “Another member was Mike Otogo a Photojournalist with The Economy Magazine who was attacked at Ojodu area of Lagos when he went to cover Ojodu Police Station set ablaze by hoodlums. “He was lucky to escape but his camera was snatched from him and smashed on the ground by hoodlums. He presently has no camera to work with.” Describing the attacks as “one too many”, Olasupo pleaded with the protesters to see photo journalists as partners who believe in their cause and should therefore allow them to carry out their lawful duties. He also urged members to stay safe and be security- conscious as they carry out their duties while commiserating with victims of the unfortunate attacks.
