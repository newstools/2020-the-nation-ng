A Prophetess of the Celestial Church of Christ (CCC), Oluwakemi Sotonode, also known as Marvelous, has been arrested by men of the Ogun State Police Command for allegedly fraudulently obtaining millions from many people. It was learnt the prophetess of CCC of Marvelous model parish, Obada-Oko has been on the wanted list of the Command for some time following a petition by one Idris Ilyas in November 2019 who reported that the suspect duped him. Idris claimed the suspect contacted him to supply kaolin stone to a company, and when he did, the Prophetess went to the company, collected N1.2million on his behalf, and converted it to her use. Also, the same Prophetess allegedly collected N200, 000 from one Olabangboye Olalekan on September 30th under the pretence she would sell a plot of land to him at Obada-Oko area of the State but disappeared after collecting the money. Likewise in April, the suspect contacted one Kehinde Ojekunle, female, to supply kaolin worth of N300, 000 to a company and she reportedly went behind her, collected the money on her behalf, and converted it to her use. In March 2020, the same suspect obtained the sum of N670, 000 from one Gbolagade Damilola under the pretence of supplying her 40 bags of rice but she ran away afterward. The Police Public Relations Officer in Ogun State, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said following series of fraud allegations against her, Police Commissioner Edward Ajogun directed operatives attached to the Public Complaint Bureau unit to arrest the prophetess. Abimbola, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), added detectives located the suspectâ€™s hideout and arrested her on Tuesday The Police spokesman disclosed that the Prophetess admitted to collecting monies from the victims but has not been able to give any reasonable account of it all.
