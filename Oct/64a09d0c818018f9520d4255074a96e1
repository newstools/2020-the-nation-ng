BEN Chilwell has had a Chelsea Premier League debut to remember as he helped the Blues to a 4-0 win over Crystal Palace with a goal and assist. The left back netted the opener from close range and followed that up with a pintpoint cross for Kurt Zouma to head home a second. Jorginho then added two penalties as Cesar Azpilicueta was forced to intervene when Tammy Abraham attempted to grab the ball off for the Italian and take the second kick. Chelsea have won six consecutive league games against Crystal Palace for the first time in their history. Chelsea have won more Premier League London derbies than any other side (133), losing just one of their last 11 such games at Stamford Bridge.  Jorginho became the second Chelsea player to score two goals from the penalty spot in a single Premier League game after Frank Lampard versus Aston Villa in March 2010. Ben Chilwell is just the third player to both score and assist a goal on their Premier League debut for Chelsea, after Deco in August 2008 and Alvaro Morata in August 2017. Frank Lampard was pleased with the way his captain dealt with the penalty saga before Chelseaâ€™s fourth goal.
