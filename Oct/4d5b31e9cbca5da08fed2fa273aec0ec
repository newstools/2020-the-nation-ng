The Lagos State Government on Monday directed all pupils/students in public and private schools to stay at home, pending the end of the anti-SARS protests. Education Commissioner Mrs Folasade Adefisayo said the directive was for the safety of the pupils/students, their parents and members of staff of their schools. Adefisayo, however, advised parents to keep an eye on their wards and not allow them to be used as willing tools by those who may want to hijack the protests. She also urged schools to utilise other means of distance teaching, including radio, television and online media, as they were doing during the recent COVID-19 lockdown. Schools in the state resumed less than a month ago.
