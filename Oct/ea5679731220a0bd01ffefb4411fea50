AJAX set a new Eredivisie record as they put thirteen goals past 10-man VVV-Venlo on Saturday to secure a mammoth 13-0 result. The Dutch giants had the game wrapped up by half-time as they raced into a 4-0 lead. However, things really started to get bad for VVV whejn Christian Klum was sent off seven minutes into the second half. Ajax went on to score nine more goals as they annihilated the hosts, with Lassina Traore adding a second-half hat-trick to his first-half brace to ended up with five goals on his own. Jurgen Ekkelenkamp and Klass-Jan Huntelaar each scored twice, with Dusan Tadic, Antony, Daley Blind and Lisandro Martinez all on the scoresheet as well. Ajax ended up having an incredible 45 shots in total, scoring over half their shots on target (23).
