The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has refuted reports the Ecumenical Centre in Abuja is on fire. Its General Secretary Barrister Joseph Daramola expressed disappointment over the rumor and warned nobody should try anything funny at the Ecumenical Centre. Daramola, who spoke with The Nation on Saturday night said: “The AIT report is fake. I’m just coming out of the Ecumenical Center now and there is no fire as reported. “Some people called me about the incident and I rushed to the Ecumenical center only to confirm that it is not true. I don’t know where AIT got there story from. “I’m using this means to warn that anybody should try anything funny”.
