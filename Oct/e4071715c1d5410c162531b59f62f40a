Ohanézè Ndígbo Youth Council Worldwide has debunked claims of killings of Northerners in Southern Nigeria. The group was reacting to a statement credited to Arewa Consultative Forum(ACF) National Publicity Secretary, Mr Emmanuel Yawe, that over 30 persons have been killed since the #ENDSARS protests turned violent. Yawe, according to media reports, also claimed over 50 trucks and trailers belonging to Northerners were destroyed. But the OYC described the allegation as a ruse and ploy to complicate issues and incite violence against Southerners in the North. OYC said after investigation on the alleged harrassment of northerners, it discovered that there was no iota of truth in the claim. The group, in a statement signed by the President General, Okechukwu Isiguzoro, and Secretary General,Okwu Nnabuike, the group urged northern leaders to cross check their facts on Security issues before going public. “OYC categorically denies these allegations by ACF on the killings of Northerners in the south as mere rumours, falsehood and fake news, and we challenge Emmanuel Yawe to produce evidence of the said killings”. “Northerners are safe and doing their normal businesses without any form of intimidation or harrassment in the Southeast. “We want to reassure the Leadership of Arewa Consultative Youth Forum led by Alhaji Yerima Shettima of the safety of Northerners in the southeast and urge them to remain committed to the mutual agreement reached with OYC on the safety of Ndigbo in the North”, OYC said.
