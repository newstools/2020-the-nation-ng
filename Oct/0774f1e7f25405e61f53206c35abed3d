 ANTHONY Joshua believes Deontay Wilder could be working on a ‘master plan’ to beat Tyson Fury after their trilogy bout failed to materialize. The WBA, WBO and IBF heavyweight champion has also revealed he ‘can’t wait’ for the Bronze Bomber to break his silence on why the fight isn’t going ahead. Fury, 32, has already declared he is moving on from the American and is targeting a new opponent for his homecoming bout on December 5. The unbeaten Brit has agreed a two-fight deal to face AJ in 2021, but Joshua, 31, must first get past his world title defence against Kubrat Pulev. And having suffered the first defeat of his professional career last year, the Olympic gold medallist can understand why Wilder has refused to speak after his loss to Fury. Speaking of his rival, he told Sky Sports: “I don’t know, so I can’t speak on everyone’s situation, but just from my humble opinion, after a loss, things change. “You distance yourself. The world is cruel. You’ve got to have a thick skin. Either he’s putting together a master plan – he’s in a lab right now, with his science glasses on, studying Fury’s every move.”
