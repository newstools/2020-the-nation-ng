 Nigeria international Frank Onyeka is in contention to make his second start in this season’s UEFA Champions League group stage in tonight’s meeting between former champions Liverpool and FC Midtjylland at Anfield. The Danish champions will be travelling to Anfield in buoyant mood too, having launched a stunning comeback at title rivals Brondby to turn a 2-0 deficit into a 3-2 win in the final half an hour at the weekend, including a 94th-minute winner. Midtjylland have not fared too well on their travels in previous European competition, though, losing seven of their nine such games and only winning one of those The former FC Ebedei defensive midfielder was spotted boarding a Great Dane Airlines flight to Liverpool yesterday. Onyeka’s Champions League debut was one to forget as FC Midtjylland were hammered 4-0 by Italian visitors Atalanta last week. If named in the starting lineup vs Liverpool as expected, it would be an important opportunity to put himself in the shop window amid speculation linking him with a departure from the Danish champions in the near future. Onyeka started all the four matches played by The Wolves in the qualifying and playoff rounds of the Champions League, and got on the scoresheet against Slavia Prague while providing an assist vs Ludogorets. Meanwhile, Dutch referee Danny Makkelie has been given Juventus-Barcelona, with English Anthony Taylor at the whistle in Club Brugge-Lazio. The Old Lady welcome Lionel Messi and co to the Allianz Stadium and the UEFA Referees Commission has appointed Makkelie as the match official. Lazio travel to Club Brugge on Wednesday, with English Anthony Taylor overseeing the Aquile’s trip to Belgium.
