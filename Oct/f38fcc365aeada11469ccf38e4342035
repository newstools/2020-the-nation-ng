African Youth For Change, a forum with millions of Nigerian youths as members, has advocated a pan-Nigeria president come 2023. Speaking in Lagos on Thursday, President, African Youth for Change Forum, Prince Hammed Olanrewaju Mohammed, who is also the Vice President of Current World Wrestling Federation, said the forum is in collaboration with the wrestling body to mobilise massively for a president that will be accepted across the country and who has the ability to bridge the gap between the North and South divide of the country. Stating that President Muhammadu Buhari has laid a solid foundation in the last six years, Mohammed said the country will need a leader with national acceptability in the mould of its national leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, to consolidate and take the country to greater heights. “We cannot deny the fact that President Buhari has laid a solid foundation of good governance with the array of dividends of democracy that can be evidently seen across the six geopolitical zones of the country, and for all these good works to last long, a leader who will cut across all ethnic divides must be elected come 2023. “At this period in the history of this great nation, we need a Pan-Nigerian leader, not a Yoruba man, not an Igbo man, not a Hausa man or anybody who thinks he comes from any of the ethnic groups in the country.” Muhammed said the group plans to embark on a global crusade to demand Asiwaju’s accept to lead the country. Majority Leader, Legislative Council of Ejigbo LCDA, Hon. Grace Nwankwo-Okere described Tinubu as a true leader who does not discriminate against anyone. She called on Yoruba leaders to support Tinubu towards becoming the next president of the country.
