Romelu Lukaku has stated Antonio Conte ‘took me to another level’, saying Inter is one big happy football family. The Belgium international gave a lengthy interview to The Times newspaper in England, assuring he has found his niche at San Siro and in Serie A. “A year ago, when I was in England, I was ‘lazy, I didn’t run, I didn’t do this and that’. Here, they call me the hardest worker in the room,” said Lukaku. “If you look at me playing here and there, I mean, there are improvements, yeah, but the [same] Rom is still here. “Stuff happens in football but it’s something you need to explain to the next generation of kids, that you need to have full control over your destiny. ‘’Make sure when you go somewhere that every piece of the puzzle has to be right. Know what I mean? At the time, we saw the outcome, we saw how I did. And if you look at me now you see a different outcome, you see the full person, you see the full potential. You see what I could have been doing in England.” He saw a “negative spiral” of criticism in the Premier League and is relishing his ability to prove them wrong now he is at Inter. “They will call me slow and I’m like, ‘Slow? Me, slow? I cannot keep up with the fast pace game of Man U? There were too many little things where I thought this is not right.” He already has three goals in two Serie A games this season, but in his debut campaign at Inter found the net 34 times in 51 competitive matches, reaching the Europa League Final. ‘’I want to thank God for putting me in this position. My mom and my brother for the unconditional love and support! Antonio conte and his staff thank you for the daily work and for believing in me. And especially my teammates you guys made this happening for me. Thank you!!’’ His decision to walk away from Manchester United last summer had a lot to do with finally getting to work with Conte, after a close call in Turin in 2017.
