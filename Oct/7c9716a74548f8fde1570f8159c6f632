The Management of BEDC Electricity Plc (BEDC) has suspended the new Service Reflective Tariff for 14 days until negotiations on the matter was finalised. In a statement, the company said postpaid customers would have their charges for the suspension reflected in the bills to be delivered in the month affecting this consumption period. Bills sent to customers in the month are based on last month’s consumption and band wise tariff as per NERC classification will apply, it said.
