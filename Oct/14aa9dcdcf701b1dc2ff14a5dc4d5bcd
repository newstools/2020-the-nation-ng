 MONARCHS in Ifedore Local Government have promised to mobilise massive votes for the re-election of Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu. They said the governor had performed well at their domains and deserved a second term. The traditional rulers spoke at the palace of the Olowa of Igbara-Oke, Oba Francis Adefarakanmi Agbede, when Akeredolu visited the area as part of his campaign tour. Oba Agbede, who spoke on behalf of the monarchs, said they had decided to appeal to their subjects to vote for Akeredolu because of his superb performance in the local government.  He said the governor is a leader who doesn’t promise and fail. Akeredolu, who urged the people to support continuity of his administration, said the state could not afford to experiment with a new comer at the moment. He noted that consistency and continuity would guarantee completion of ongoing projects and the realisation of the deep seaport, which his administration was pursuing. He said his administration has built roads in the local government, including Igbara-Oke road, Ibuji road, Isarun road, Ero and Ijare roads among others. Akeredolu said: “Consistency is key. You don’t experiment with governance. Let our performance be the judge. We have worked, but we can do more. If there had been consistency after the late Agagu left office, we would have had a seaport by now. Mimiko got there and abandoned the project for eight years.”
