 Napoli coach Gennaro Gattuso  said he was ecstatic  to see Nigeria international Victor Osimhen scored  his first Serie A goal for the Gil Azzurri  after his side’s 4-1 thrashing of Atalanta on Saturday. He described the 21-year-old his transfer wish  even as he lauded  the management of  Napoli  for assenting to his request of drafting the FIFA U-17 World Cup winner to the Blues. “Osimhen was my wish and I thank the President of Napoli for having satisfied me. It wasn’t easy but we have bought a player who is very important to us,” Gattuso said in the post-match interview. “I’m happy for Chucky’s brace, but Osimhen’s goal makes me happy because he hadn’t scored so far and he deserved it for the hard work done for the team.”  In  a related development, Osimhen has equally  expressed happiness over his first goal in the Serie A, while attributing his feat to team work. : “I’m happy but what matters is the team, we have proved to be compact “, the Nigerian told Corriere del Mezzogiorno. Osimhen,  in the meantime,  dedicated his first Serie A goal  to the ‘End Police Brutality protest ’ in Nigeria  otherwise known as  #EndSARS campaign  after scoring in his side’s 4-1 routing of Atalanta.
