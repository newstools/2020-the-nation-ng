The embattled Group Managing Director of Odua Investment company Limited, Mr. Adewale Raji, and two other officials have been summoned by the National Industrial Court of Nigeria for contempt of Court. This was contained in the order of the court signed by Justice Peters of the National Industrial Court of Nigeria, Ibadan Division. It was in response to an action filed by a claimant, Mr. Abiodun Adedeji, a top management staff of the company against embattled GMD on oppression, discrimination, and misrepresentation of facts to the Board of the company. The trouble started on September 21 2020 when the Bailiff of the court attempted to serve the company secretary but the security attached to Raji beat the two bailiffs and tore their shirts. The bailiff then went again on September 23, 2020, and was prevented from entering the elevator to 23 floors where the office of the Company Secretary and GMD were. The bailiffs were directed to drop it to the security which was dropped at the security gate. The company refused to appear or its officials or their counsels on September 29 2020 when the case was mentioned at the court. The presiding judge thereafter ordered the GMD, the Company Secretary, and the Head of Himan Resources to appear on Wednesday, October 14 2020 in person for contempt of court. The bailiff was again to deliver the court process on Wednesday, October 7, 2020, when the bailiff was beaten up, arrested, and handed over to CID headquarters, Iyanganku Ibadan. The bailiff was released immediately and the court papers were left at Odua despite intimidation and harassment by the police attached to the GMD, Odua, and Raji. The court order for the contempt was conspicuously pasted at the company premises on Thursday, October 8, 2020. Meanwhile, Raji has asked the two senior officials, Mrs. Yinka Tunji Ojo and Mr. Biodun Adedeji who refused to allow the company to be mismanaged to leave which is the subject of dispute in court.
