PEP GUARDIOLA has expressed his desire to stay at Manchester City beyond the expiry of his current contract, despite Barcelona presidential candidate Victor Font publicly calling for him to return to Camp Nou in the near future. Guardiola has won two Premier League titles with Manchester City since joining in 2016, but the club are yet to move to extend his deal, which expires at the end of the season. His future has been further muddied by City’s questionable recent form – after yielding their title to Liverpool last season, they have won just two of five matches to start 2020/21.  Speaking ahead of Saturday’s clash with Sheffield United, however, the Spaniard made it unequivocally clear he is in no rush to leave. A comment celebrated by the club’s official channels reads: “I am incredibly happy here. I’m delighted to be in Manchester and hopefully I can do a good job this season to stay longer.”
