 Strike by the organised labour scheduled to begin on Monday over non implementation of N30,000 minimum wage by the Kwara State Government will be injurious to Kwarans, Gamji Members Association (GAMA) has said. It urged labour unions to rethink its mobilisation of its members for the industrial action. Organised labour’s strike notice on the state government over failure on the implementation expired early today. “While we understand the standpoint of the labour unions, especially from the point of view of the rising cost of living, we caution that embarking on an industrial action is not the solution. This is especially true when we consider the fact that the state government’s finances are stretched already,” Alhaji Abdullahi Yinka Agaka, publicity secretary of the pan-northern Nigerian group, said in a statement. GAMA is an umbrella body for followers of the late Premier of the Northern Region, Sir Ahmadu Bello (Sardauna). “Like the state government has been doing, we also appeal to the workers to have a rethink, embrace more talks and appreciate the fact that the government, whatever its imperfections, has shown good faith in handling workers’ welfare social investments and infrastructural development, even during COVID-19 when it never stopped paying or cut workers’ salaries like a few states did. Similarly, we call on the government to continue to engage the labour unions since both sides comprise patriotic elements. “We appeal to both sides to act according to the realities of the state. A strike will hurt millions of people. Both sides have a responsibility to not bring unnecessary hardship to the populace. If there is any strike, both sides will still return to the negotiating table and this explains the futility of letting things get to the point of strike. “
