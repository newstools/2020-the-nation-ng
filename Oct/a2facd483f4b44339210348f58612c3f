 President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday requested the Senate to consider and approve the revised 2020 budget of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The President’s letter was read on the floor of the upper chamber by Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, during plenary. Buhari said the revised estimates of revenue and expenditure were proposed in response to the lower revenues and higher personnel costs projected for the Federal Capital Territory Administration in the 2020 fiscal year due to the Coronavirus Pandemic as well as the decline in global and domestic economic performance.

Also to be confirmed are: Dr. Musiliu Oseni as vice chairman; and Aisha Mahmud as commissioner.
