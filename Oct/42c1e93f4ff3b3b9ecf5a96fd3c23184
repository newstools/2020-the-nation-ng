A non-partisan youth movement, Standup Against Corrupt Politicians, (SACP) has strongly condemned hoodlums’ attacks on #ENDSARS protesters protesting against the Special Anti-Robbery Squad of the Nigeria Police. Thousands of youths across Nigeria protested the high-handedness and harassment of citizens by operatives of the disbanded SARS. But the protests took a fresh dimension when hoodlums suspected to have been hired by politicians, bearing cutlasses and sticks, attacked protesters in Lagos and Abuja. Condemning the attacks, SACP coordinator in Lagos, Comrade Emmanuel Feyijimi, said the attackers were “unemployed youths whose frustrations were weaponized by hawkish elements within and outside of government.” Emmanuel said some politicians are fond of using thugs and security operatives to intimidate perceived political opponents. He said a former member of the group who ventured into politics, Comrade Kehinde Okeowo, was similarly treated when he contested for political office in 2017. “Because Okeowo was popular among youths in Nigeria, some rogue politicians who saw him as a threat sent hired thugs after the young man. Several people were injured and even another candidate was killed at a political rally. “As I’m talking to you now, the youths have not experienced peace. All these are some of the problems fueling youth restiveness in the country, and must be address by the government,” he said. He said SACP will continue to fight for good governance by exposing corrupt politicians and serve as a veritable platform for youths to occupy political leadership positions to bring about the needed positive change in the country.
