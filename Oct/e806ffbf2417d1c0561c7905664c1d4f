Operatives of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) have arrested a businessman, Charles Ekwe, for alleged serial rape of his wife’s niece. Ekwe was also alleged to have exposed the 13-year-old to pornographic material and threatened to harm her should she reveal the sexual assaults to anyone. The suspect was apprehended on October 12 following a complaint lodged by his wife, Mrs. Blessing Ekwe, at the gender unit of the NSCDC. She said the victim had stayed with them for over four years following the death of her father, adding that she noticed something was wrong with the girl and after questioning her, the victim opened up. “It was three weeks ago. I came in and met two of them in wrappers. I was not comfortable with the reaction so I allowed my husband leave then I asked her what happened. “She confessed that it’s been long since Daddy has been having sex with her and always threatening her not to talk.” Ekwe denied defiling the minor or exposing her to pornography. “She said daddy will take her to the shop and ask her to bend. So, I took her for medical check up and it was confirmed that she has been defiled. Ekwe denied defiling the minor or exposing her to pornography. Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Minister of State, Dr. Ramatu Aliyu  on Thursday said that laws are underway to ensure that established cases of rape are no longer admissible to bail. The minister said this at the presentation of a compendium titled “My COVID-19 Story; Voice Of Hope and Resilience”, which chronicled different experiences of young girls during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Aliyu, represented by the Deputy Director Administration in the office of FCT Minister of State, Mrs. Maria Ogbonnaya-Ngwu, said the FCT Administration has established a centre to address cases of girls who are abused or suppressed.
