 German  coach  Gernot Rohr has yet  offered a solidarity message to Nigerian and indeed fans of the Super Eagles  in the wake of destruction  and looting  across the country occasioned by  widespread  protests by young people over  police brutality  and  the disbandment of a notorious police unit, the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). The 67-year-old former Bayern Munich defender  said he was hopeful that  the country  would overcome  the  current challenges even as he rallied  support for the Super Eagles ahead of next month’s  double head  Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifiers against Sierra Leone. “We have a big solidarity in the Super  Eagles  for our fans, so my thoughts are with Nigeria at this difficult times,” Rohr told NationSport  from his base in France.“ I hope everything will be settled very soon; Nigerians need to refocus now.  “ Of course, we would come together soon and I know that youths need fun that sports provide and I hope everything would be alright  once football returns.” He added: “ It’s not only Nigeria that is facing challenges  because here in  France, there is also a protest against beheading of teacher because of  religious  cartoons. I hope everyone would be protected after these unfortunate incidents. “ The Rohr-led Super Eagles  who  had two  international friendly matches against Algeria and Tunisia in Austria,  are expected to meet  Sierra  Leone  at home on  9th November  with the reverse fixture on 14th November. “ But the family (Super Eagles)  has to be strong in order to do our job together and help each other after  the protest and  COVID-19 pandemic ,” noted Rohr.
