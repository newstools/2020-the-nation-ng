NOLLYWOOD veteran, Ebele Okaro-Onyuke has secured a fresh endorsement with a new firm. Okaro-Onyuke was recently unveiled as brand ambassador for Diva World Trading Services, makers of Diva palm oil, plantain flour, oat flour, and yam flour. Speaking on the new deal, the excited actress was full of praise for the feat the company has achieved. She says: “I feel honored, first of all, Diva products are proudly Nigerian. A lot of people are used to imported foods, from rice to other things. Fortunately, I am one person who is proud of Nigerian products, for instance, I eat Nigerian rice. when she called me and said she has Nigerian products, I was amazed, when I saw everything she has on board, the rice, the oaths, the plantain, I was moved, I was surprised and asked, if we really have all these things here in Nigeria, when I’m coming from the East, I buy most of the things, especially plantain flour, and you know some of those things are mixed, we don’t know how it is processed, so now we have something clean, that is been offered to the people. The most amazing thing is that, it’s all Nigeria, we have to learn to patronize our own, a lot of people say Nigeria is not good, I am not part of it, no matter how bad Nigeria is. The Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of the company, Ifeanyinwa Nnana Mba said the choice of Onyuke was well thought out. The event was also attended by Nollywood actress, Dayo Amusa.
