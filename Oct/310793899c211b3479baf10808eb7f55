THE first thing I am going to do with the money is for my mum,” those were the words of the winner of the fifth edition of the BBNaija reality TV show, Olamilekan Moshood Agbeleshe aka Laycon. In an exclusive chat with The Nation, Laycon said he will be spending some of his fortunes on his mum though he confessed to not knowing what in particular he wants to do for his mum. He said, “I don’t know what it is and I haven’t thought past that at the moment but I am certain that the first thing I want to do with the money is for my mum, all other things are using the win to promote love and light, make a positive impact in the society basically because that is the whole point of living.” Laycon won a grand prize of N85 million that included N30 million cash prize, a two-bedroom house, a trip to Dublin, Dubai amongst several prizes. He also won over N5.4 million in earnings for tasks and challenges while in the house. A few days back, he was presented with a cheque of N5 million by the Ogun State governor, Dapo Abiodun, as well as the keys to a new apartment in Ogun State.
