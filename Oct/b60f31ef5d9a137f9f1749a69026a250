The Agency for Mass Education under the Office of the Special Adviser on  Education in Lagos State has trained 245  census enumerators  selected from various wards and local governments across the state. Participants were grouped and assigned different days and location for the programme to obey the  rule of social distancing.The exercise is set to last  for two weeks. Speaking during the training at Vocational Training Centre, Surulere, Lagos, the Director  Agency for Mass Education, Mrs Olukemi Kalesanwo, stated that the agency was conducting the training for enumerators and coordinators  to plan effectively for the future of children. “The government needs to plan, because if there is no plan, there is no way we would be able to take good care of our children,” she said. She stated that the agency is privately run and is in charge of formal education with three major programmes to reduce illiteracy. The  programmes include, Mass Literacy Program where people under primary schools are taught, the Vocational Training Center for skill acquisition and the Continuing Education Centre  for people in secondary schools  and those preparing for external exams like UTME,private GCE and others. Kalesanwo urged  teachers to show professionalism,give accurate facts  and display humility  in carrying out their tasks. Director, Vocational Education,Mr Dele Obaba said the census would   help them plan and monitor continuing education centers in the state. One of the enumerators, Mrs Balogun Ibijoke  said the training was  an eye opener for her.
