MANCHESTER UNITED have agreed to pay veteran Uruguayan striker Edinson Cavani £20million to move to Old Trafford. United opened talks with the 33-year-old former Paris St Germain and Napoli forward during the week after deciding that Borussia Dortmund’s £107million asking price for Jadon Sancho is too rich.  High-level sources at United confirmed on Saturday that negotiations went well and Cavani is now expected to sign a two-year contract worth £200,000-a-week. Cavani became a free agent after leaving PSG at the end of the season.
