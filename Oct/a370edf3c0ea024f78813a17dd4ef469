Chairman of the National Union of the Road Transport Workers (NURTW) Lagos State Council Alhaji Musiliu Akinsanya (aka MC Oluomo) has described allegations he sponsored attacks on #EndSARS protesters at Alausa as mischievous. He told The Nation he had issued a statement in support of the protest since October 11. He wondered why people will link the event in Alausa to him. The union leader said: “I was surprised when my aides brought it to my attention what people were tweeting on the issue. “I couldn’t have been involved in such act because I support the quest to reform the police force. How will I do such when my brothers and sisters are among the protesters?” According to him, no sane member of the union will join people to attack the protesters because it is for the good of everybody. He said: “Today being the anniversary of my first year in office, I deliberately cancelled the idea of celebration due to the situation in the country and to lend my support to the protest. “As a good citizen who abhors anything violence, I wonder how people will link me with the violence that took place in Alausa. “I always warn my people not to involve in violence and whoever does, I will personally hand over the person to the security agency. “I didn’t send anyone to disrupt or attack the #EndSARS protesters. We all want the police force to be reformed. We all want better welfare for our police officers. “We all want our police officers to stand shoulder to shoulder with their counterparts in any part of the world. This will definitely translate to security of lives of our people in the country.” He warned members of the union to avoid any act capable of tarnishing the image of the NURTW.
