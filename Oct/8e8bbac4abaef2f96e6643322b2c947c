There was mild drama on Thursday at the National Assembly over the lawmakers’ N128billion budget proposal. President Muhammadu Buhari appeared to have stirred the hornets’ nest during the presentation of N13.08billion 2021 budget estimate. The President entered the House of Representatives Chambers venue of the budget presentation by 11.01am and proceeded to the rostrum at 11.22am after Senate President Ahmad Lawan’s opening remarks. All appeared to be smooth as the President continued with his budget speech until he got to the sectoral allocation to the National Assembly. Apparently sensing apprehension by the lawmakers and members of the public over the amount allocated to the National Assembly, the President held his breath, took a long pulse before he dramatically mentioned the National Assembly. There was palpable uproar and prolonged laughter by the lawmakers and the others at the lobby as the President struggled with mentioning the National Assembly Convinced of the effect of what he wanted to say, the President quipped, “Let me read it again.” He smiled and continued, “National Assembly, N128billion.” While reading the sectoral allocations in alphabetical order, Buhari said: “F. National Assembly…F. National Assembly (prolonged laughter). Well I will read that again. (More laughter) F. National Assembly N128 billion. (At this time even Buhari himself smiled).” In the 2020 Appropriation Bill, President Buhari proposed N125billion for the National Assembly. The lawmakers however jerked it up to N128billion.
