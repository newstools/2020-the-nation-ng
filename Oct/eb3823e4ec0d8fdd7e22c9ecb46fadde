 Fast-rising gospel artist, Bidemi Olaoba, is set to hold another edition of ‘Unrestricted Praises.’ The show, which has held about eight previous virtual editions during the COVID-19 lockdown, is scheduled for October 23. Past editions of the show have featured acts like Woli Arole, Mike Abdul, Dare Justified, and many others. This upcoming edition is going to be streamed live on Olaoba’s YouTube channel and DoveTV. It is expected to feature Sammy Okposo, Buchi, Beejay Sax, Leke Adeboye, Eben. According to Olaoba’s publicist, Tola Omosehin, “the concept was to create an avenue for people to praise God during the lockdown and as movements were restricted but there are no restrictions to praising God so that was what gave birth to the name Unrestricted Praises.” Olaoba also is known for his favourite scriptural quotation #TheBibleSays during his ministration, recently released a new song titled “Bonjour”. Ahead of his birthday this month, he is expected to drop another hit single titled “Akanchawa”.
