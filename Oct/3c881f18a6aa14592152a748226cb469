The expansive building, it was gathered, was set ablaze by hoodlums who invaded the premises, chased out the workers before carrying out their nevarious activity. The building was razed as the NPA firefighters ran for their dear lives when they were unable to arrest the inferno. The fire which sources said has been brought under control started around 10 am yesterday morning and touched over five floors of the nine story building. A senior official of the agency who craved anonymity told The Nation that the hoodlums also attacked the NPA facility in Dockyard, Apapa, and carted away valuable items. All vehicles on the premises were also set on fire by some unidentified hoodlums. Staff members in the Apapa area are currently scampering for safety as they took cover at the seaside.

Meanwhile, The Guardian gathered that the Warri Port is also under siege as the gates are now locked with tyres burnt around the port.
