 THE Chairman of Okitipupa Local Government, Mr. Babatunde Akinrinwa, has urged residents to vote for the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Arakunrin Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, on Saturday. He said the governor had brought excellence to governance with his Midas touch, which encapsulated high intention to serve, spiced with inputs of sincere efforts and the display of brilliant execution of novel ideas in every aspect of the administration. Akinrinwa spoke with reporters at Okitipupa, the headquarters of the local government. He said since his inauguration, Akeredoluâ€™s five cardinal programmes had centre on job creation through agriculture, entrepreneurship, industrialisation, massive infrastructure development, education and technology growth, quality health care and social service delivery, rural development and community extension services. The council chief, however, promised residents accelerated development by looking inward to increase the Internally Generated Revenue (IGI) accruing to the local government.
