Founder of Living Faith Church Worldwide, Bishop David Oyedepo, has thrown his weight behind the ongoing #ENDSARS protests across the nation. The protesters, he said, are justified because “Nigerians have been pushed to the wall.” Speaking during a service at the auditorium of Cananland, Ota, Ogun state, he said young people have the right to protest, warning security operatives not to attack them. “Every man has a right, legitimately so, to express their displeasure and pains. I kept quiet for a while because in 2015, I warned this nation, vehemently, consistently, because I saw the dangers ahead and you can tell,” he began. “The most gruesome season in the history of the nation is the last five years where lives have no value, wanton killings here and there. “Now they have faced the youths and because they don’t know who is next, they have the right to say enough is enough. Any system that has no value for human lives is irrelevant. “And now, it would be a sacrilege to shoot the protesters who are not looting, who are not ravaging. When you push a goat to the wall then you will know that goats have teeth to bite. “It is a sacrilege to kill youths during a protest, this protest is legitimate.”
