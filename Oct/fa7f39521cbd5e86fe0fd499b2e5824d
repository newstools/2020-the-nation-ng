 FC Lorient record signing, Terem Moffi, has dedicated his debut goal in French football to all the victims of police brutality in Nigeria. For almost two weeks running, youths across Nigeria have been protesting police brutality, especially those done by the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) and Moffi lent a voice to their struggle. Moffi joined Lorient from Belgian club KV Kortrijk, where he scored five goals in nine league games, for eight million Euros last month; one million less for Adrian Grbic’s move from Clermont Foot in the summer transfer window. The 21-year-old former junior international took to social media to celebrate a dream debut in Ligue 1 and helping Les Merlus to only their second win of the season, a 3-1 win at Stade Reims. The striker, who was on for 86 minutes, was a thorn in the flesh of the Reims defence, scoring his team’s third goal in the 80th minute after he caused the penalty for Lorient to net their second goal in the 63rd minute. “Brilliant team performance,” Moffi, the first Nigerian to play for the French club, tweeted.” Dedicated to all the ones who have suffered from police brutality.”
