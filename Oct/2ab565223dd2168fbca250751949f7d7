The Lagos Police Command has described as mischievous reports that scores of suspects fled from the detention of the disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) in Ikeja. There were claims on the social media many suspects fled from custody on Wednesday night while being moved to the State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID), Panti. Refuting the report, police spokesman, Olumuyiwa Adejobi, said it was an unfounded, baseless and mischievous rumour. He said: “The attention of the Lagos State Command has been drawn to a rumour making waves on the social media that some suspects of the disbanded SARS escaped from the cell at the Command Headquarters, Ikeja, Lagos State on Wednesday. “The command perceives such rumour unfounded, mischievous and baseless. It is an attempt to cause fear and panic in the minds of Lagosians, and distracting the command. “In line with the directive of the IGP, the State Criminal Investigation Department, Yaba, has taken over the disbanded SARS and other tactical units’ buildings in Ikeja and other satellite offices across the state, including the suspects. “It’s pertinent to state that some of the suspects, who have been convicted, have undergone COVID-19 test which is a prerequisite to accepting them into correctional centres; but the command awaits their results before further actions. “The suspects in all the cases handled by the disbanded SARS are intact. “The Deputy Commissioner of Police, State CID, Panti, Yaba, DCP Yetunde Longe, has temporarily relocated to the disbanded SARS building at Ikeja for thorough supervision and accountability of the taking over the process. “The command, therefore, urges the public to regard the news as a rumour, baseless and mischievous to suit the intention of the originator(s) as the command is committed to reforming the policing system and providing adequate security for all in the state.”
