The lawmaker representing Ondo Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, Hon Abiola Makinde, and Chairperson of the African Democratic Congress(ADC), Chief Tokunbo Adetoro, have defected to the ruling All Progressives Congress to support the re-election of Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu. Makinde was elected on the platform of ADC in the 2019 general elections. Other members of ADC from 10 local government areas of the state also defected to the APC Mrs. Adetoro said the decision to collapse their structure into the ruling party was informed by the performances of Governor Akeredolu. Adetoro stated that it was to ensure continuity of the good work adding that Akeredolu deserved a second term. She promised to mobilise support for Akeredolu and the APC at their various local government areas. Ondo APC chairman, Engr. Ade Adetimehin, who received the defectors, commended them for taking “the right step in the right direction”. He said they’re joining the APC would boost the party’s chances at the poll. Adetimehin also accused opposition political parties of deliberately launching unprovoked attacks on members of the APC to cause tension He said the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) planned to send wrong signals about the state to the outside world. His words: “The PDP and ZLP have attacked us repeatedly while we have resisted the temptation to fight back. Our decision not borne out of cowardice but we feel we are in a position to display maturity. We feel we should be more careful because we are better favoured to win the election. “All they are doing is to create tension in the State, and possibly discredit the process. We have resolved to continue to tolerate them; we won’t retaliate, irrespective of the degree of provocation,” the statement reads in part.
