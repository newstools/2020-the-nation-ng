Some members of Kogi Assembly have been displaced from their quarters located along the Ganaja road as surging flood wrecks havocs in Lokoja, the capital city and other parts of the State. Hundreds of other residents have been rendered homeless by the flood. Findings by The Nation showed the situation is worsening daily, while distraught residents of adjourning communities and those from no less than nine other local government areas seek non- existing alternatives in the capital. A number of the displaced, including those from Shintako, in Bassa LGA, along with the little belongings they could carry, were seen overnight crossing over in canoes into Lokoja. The flood has also taken over parts of the pivotal Nataco road and the Old Market areas of Kabawa, among other high density areas of the capital. As at Saturday, access into the Ganaja village was basically via canoe or flying boats as the major road that connects Lokoja to Kogi East and other eastern states of the country have been overrun by water. At least eight households were sacked in the Assembly quarters. Those affected called for urgent action to ameliorate the situation, even as they declined having their names in print. Many of those chased from their homes however remained in quandary, as it is yet unclear if there are any designated camps for those that have been displaced.
