The Bosnian returned to the Allianz Juventus Stadium for the first time as an opponent after his summer exchange for Arthur, although his replacement was on the bench.
“I am happy to have come back here and met up with so many friends,” Pjanic told Mediaset after a 2-0 result. “It was a complicated game and a tough one, but we deserved the victory against a great opponent. It gives us confidence going forward and we must build on it.  “These were two strong teams facing off, but Barcelona certainly deserved the victory more than Juve this evening. We played well in every area of the pitch and could’ve scored more goals, but we’re satisfied.” The Bianconeri are struggling under new coach Andrea Pirlo, drawing each of their last three Serie A games and losing in the Champions League. “I wish Juve all the best and I hope they can win the Scudetto again this season. There are many talented players who will be important for Juventus.”
