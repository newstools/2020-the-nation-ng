 MEMBERS of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) have called for the immediate and unconditional release of its media Head, Mazi Emmanuel Bassey Ekomiba, from detention in Akwa Ibom State. They also asked security agents to release his colleague, Mazi Victor Sunday Okoro, form detention. IPOB said the duo were arrested in Akwa Ibom State during evangelism on September 30, 2020. A statement by its Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, said there was no justification for their arrests as they were not terrorists and had not committed any crime that warranted their arrest. The statement reads: “We want to put the world on notice of the abduction of Mazi Emmanuel Bassey Ekomiba, the Media Head of IPOB in Akwa Ibom State; and his colleague, Mazi Victor Sunday Okoro, who were abducted in Akwa Ibom State during the evangelism on September 30, 2020. “We demand their immediate release because they are not terrorists nor did they commit anything to warrant any arrest. “We equally demand the unconditional release of all Biafra agitators picked by security agents. We want the Army that besieged the home of our leader at Isiama Afaraukwu on the October 1, 2020, to stop harassing residents of the area because they are not terrorists. “Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lt.-Gen. Yufuf Buratai should send his soldiers to Sambisa Forest, Baga in Borno State and other Northern communities taken over by terrorists. “IPOB is a peaceful movement committed to peaceful restoration of Biafra. Biafra is a divine project designed by the Most High God in Heaven, and there is nothing anybody can do to change our resolve to actualise Biafra independence.”
