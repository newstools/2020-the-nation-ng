 THE Senior Pastor of Grace Family International Church, Rev. Yinka Ojo, has said Nigeria has a divine destiny despite the challenges occasioned by the #EndSARs protest. He was answering questions in Alausa CBD, Ikeja from reporters at a pre-conference briefing on the coming 30th international convention of the church. The convention with the theme: ‘Behold I will do a new thing’, will hold from November 4 to 8 at its auditorium on Otunba Jobifele Way, Alausa. The grand finale will hold at its new camp ground in Lekki, Lagos. Ojo said Nigerians must look at the positive things in the midst of the challenges plaguing the nation. “God is working in our land. Things are going to get better. Some nations have not witnessed one-tenth of some of the negative things we have experienced and they are no more, because countries die, but God has helped us. “We believe a better nation is what we will experience all our lives. We are going to achieve greater things and we cannot divorce God from that achievement. We believe there will be positive changes. This is what God wants and this is what we want. “We urge Nigerians to lift up their eyes on to God from where cometh our help. We are trusting God that the prayers and messages that will be calling out during this convention will change and transform lives. There will be a positive resolve towards nation building and we believe this is what God wants and this is what this nation wants,” the clergyman said.
