 THE Board of Governors of PEARL Awards Nigeria and its Central Working Committee have resolved to step down the 2020 PEARL Awards Nite. In a statement by Olalekan Adekoya, Secretary, PEARL Awards Board of Governors, the board stated that the decision to step down this yearâ€™s awards was necessitated by the horrendous effect of the pandemic both on businesses and humanity, which has negatively impacted private sector organisations and government institutions alike, coupled with the subsisting need for social distancing globally.
