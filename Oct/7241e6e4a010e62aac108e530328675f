Residents of Kano metropolis are in fears over a possible resurgence of the violence that greeted the #EndSARS protests in the state on Tuesday. Banks and traders did not open on Friday as many streets were deserted. Kano youths on Tuesday joined the nationwide #EndSARS protests. But hoodlums hijacked the demonstration, vandalising grandiose malls and business places. Scores were feared dead, cars smashed and burnt, schools shut down as fear gripped the ancient city. The rioters invaded and vandalised the popular Galaxy Mall along Igbo Road in Sabon Gari area as well as the Chicken Republic eatery located along Airport Road. Many were reportedly injured. But for the prompt intervention of Governor Abdullahi Ganduje, the violence would have toured the path of religion and ethnicity. Ganduje has set up a 17-member committee and charged it to convene “Ethnic Community Meetings” and collectively ensure peace returns to the ancient city. The commmitte, co-chaired by Igwe Boniface Ibekwe and Rev. Adeyemi Samuel, has representatives from the Christian Association of Nigeria, representatives of various Christian denominations, Christian youth groups, representatives of ethnic nationalities and traders. Commissioner for Information, Muhammad Garba, said: “The #EndSARS protest in Kano was hijacked by hoodlums with the aim to cause mayhem in the state.” Commissioner of Police, Habu Sani, explained that the protesters had told the police they will go to Government House but changed their direction to Airport Road and it resulted into clashes.
