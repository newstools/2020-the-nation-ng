Liverpool winger Xherdan Shaqiri has tested positive for coronavirus, the Swiss football association has confirmed.
The 28-year-old Swiss winger returned the positive test after joining up with the Switzerland squad for their upcoming games against Croatia, Spain and Germany. The Swiss FA confirmed Shaqiri is now in isolation and is “in contact with health authorities”.  The statement reads: “The strict protective measures and requirements of UEFA for national teams in accordance with the ‘UEFA Return to Play Protocol’ have been strictly adhered to since the move began. “Based on this, clarifications are currently underway with the local health authorities about how to proceed.” Shaqiri, who was linked with a move away from Anfield this summer, is the third Liverpool player to test positive for coronavirus after Thiago Alcantara and Sadio Mane.
