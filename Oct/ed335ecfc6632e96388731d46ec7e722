Former President Goodluck Jonathan on Tuesday called for restraint as the #EndSARS protest continues. He tweeted via his verified handle @GEJonathan: “No Nigerian blood needs to be spilt or life lost during a peaceful protest that seeks to advance our country. “We may hold different views on national issues, but there is no doubt that most people desire the same thing for Nigeria: a place where we can all live out the full potential of our God-given abilities. “I implore everyone to exercise restraint as we walk through these challenging times.”
