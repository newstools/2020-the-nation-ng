Actress, Ejiro Okurame, is now a mother. She made this known on her Facebook page with pictures of herself with Onome Akpobome (son of late Efe Okedi, late Ras Kimono’s wife) in romantic posture with her baby bump. She wrote: “ Thank God for safe delivery…welcome our precious princess. #SeptemberToRemember 30-09-2020. Thank you for those who stood by me during this journey.”
When Okedi was alive, it was rumoured Onome and Okurame, who was Okedi’s close friend, were secretly ‘seeing themselves’. Immediately she died, Onome moved to her Festac home and they hit it off.
