 A POLITICIAN from Owerri zone, Chief Henry Njoku (popularly called Harritex), has dumped the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the All Progressives Congress (APC). He made the move with hundreds of his supporters, associates and friends from across Imo State. Making the declaration at the Government House, Owerri, Njoku said he decided to join the APC after due consultations with his family, friends and associates, and after carefully studying the Governor Hope Uzodimma’s governance mantra of Reconstruction, Rehabilitation and Recovery. He said his conviction of the personal antecedents of Governor Uzodimma also convinced him that Imo State is in safe and capable hands. He eulogized the capacity of Governor Uzodimma to pilot meaningfully the affairs of the State and said he is joining the governor in APC to assist in contributing to the laudable goals and aspirations of the Governor. He said in joining the APC he will be committed to the ideals, philosophy and ideology of the party under the leadership of Chief Marcon Nlemigbo-led State Executive Council and GovernorHope Uzodimma as the State Leader. Njoku further assured of his willingness to unite all party men, women and youths from Owerri North and beyond into a one and stronger forum to assist the governor to achieve his set goals. He however added that he is leaving his former party, the PDP with a good heart and without grudges, but “with the hope and believe that the members will understand and appreciate the high philosophical and intents of the movement.”
