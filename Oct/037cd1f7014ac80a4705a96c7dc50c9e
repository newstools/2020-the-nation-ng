 ONE of the five BBNaija Lockdown finalists, Neo, has explained the current status of his relationship with Vee. In a quick chat with The Nation, Neo says he’s really cool with Vee and believes every other thing will fall into place. “Myself and Vee are really cool, I’m sure everybody is trying to find out what is going to be the next step or next thing. I’m happy everyone understands that what is there is there between us and we are where we are right now but the thing is that after house, we are tied up trying to get it on and find our feet individually so everyone is trying to make the money and time is running fast and we’ve not had time to see eye to eye and everyone is trying to make their brand work and we don’t want to put the relationship forward at the moment. “Now we are out, we are seeing how our lives have changed and we need to capitalise on that before time runs out but every other thing will fall in place.” On his family’s reception after his exit from the BBNaija show, Neo said, “ My family has been amazing, the whole house literally put their lives on pause just for me, I mean they are huge in numbers but the support they gave me has been amazing. I got on the phone with him after my first day out and he was telling me how I did good and all I have gotten from him is a bunch of congratulations and happiness for me.”
