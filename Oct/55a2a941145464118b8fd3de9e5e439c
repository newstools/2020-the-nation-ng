Palpable fear enveloped a section of Oye-Ekiti in Oye local government areas of Ekiti as some gunmen killed a security guard working with the Federal University of Oye-Ekiti (FUOYE). The gun-wielding bandits were said to have stormed the deceased’s farmland located in the town last Friday where the 62-year-old man identified as Mathew Malik was murdered. The deceased’s son, John Malik, who spoke with journalists in Ado-Ekiti, the state capital on Thursday, said his father was allegedly killed over a disagreement between him and some unnamed persons over his farm. He explained his father went to the farm last Friday but never returned to resume to his duty post in the FUOYE, where he was working. “My dad is a security man in FUOYE and on that day, he was scheduled to go to work in the afternoon but decided to visit his farm in the morning. “It was his people in the university that called us that he was yet to resume his duty post. Immediately, we commenced the search work to the farm and we met him dead. “There was this man he had issues with as regards the farm and we are suspecting he might have masterminded the killing our father”. He called on the security agencies to ensure the perpetrators are arrested and made to face the full wrath of justice, adding that the family would not allow the case to be swept under the carpet. When contacted, the Ekiti Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Sunday Abutu confirmed the incident. He said the police had commenced an investigation to unravel the killers. “Yes, I can confirm the man was attacked on his farm days ago, and we have started an investigation into the unfortunate act. “We will ensure the perpetrators are arrested and prosecuted in accordance with the law so as to serve as a deterrent to others planning such dastardly act, ” Abutu said.
