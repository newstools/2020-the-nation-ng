At least three person were feared killed and several others injured in Dutse Alhaji area on Tuesday as thugs continued to unleash mayhem in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Abuja. The Dutse Makaranta Police Station was set ablaze by the suspected hoodlums. Also torched were a church and a filling station. They vandalised several vehicles and shops in the area. The thugs, which many residents have reportedly sighted, conveyed in large trucks and buses, have consistently attacked #ENDSARS protesters since last week. Last Saturday they stabbed a protester, Tony Onome, to death around Kubwa. On Monday they descended on residents and businesses, who were not even part of the protests in Apo area. They burnt cars, shops and attacked anybody they came across. Seven people were killed in the incident, the police confirmed. The development caused the protesters to change strategy as they had always broken themselves into groups and blocked various points in Abuja to drive home their demands. The constant attacks by the thugs had made them reconsider and remain in a group so they can have the number to withstand any attack. At the moment it appears the thugs are running riot in the nationâ€™s capital, attacking various locations randomly. Many have wondered who sponsored the influx of thugs in the city. The protesters alleged government sponsored the thugs to discredit them and disrupt their agitations. Those against the protests believe the mass action has been hijacked by criminals, who decided to use the opportunity to run riot as well as disgruntled politicians, who also seek to discredit the government of the day.
