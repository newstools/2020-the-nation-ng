The remains of the late legendary poet, Prof. John Pepper Clark-Bekeredemo, were expected to be interred last night at his country home in Kiagbodo, Burutu Council Area of Delta State. The Nation learnt that the remains of the prolific writer arrived in Delta State from Lagos State where he died. The Emeritus Professor of Literature reportedly requested in his “written will,” a low-key funeral, within three days of his passing on. A community source, who disclosed the possibility of the burial, said: “I don’t really know, but it cannot be very far from the truth.” A family source, however, said: “The family is working hard to fulfil his wish to be buried within three days of his death.” It was gathered that J. P. Clark had his grave dug at his Kiagbodo creek home while he was alive. The renowned literary artist died in the early hours of Tuesday in Lagos. He was 85.
