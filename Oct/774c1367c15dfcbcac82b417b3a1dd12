Some operatives of the Ikere Division Police in Ikere-Ekiti, the headquarters of Ikere Local Government Area of Ekiti State on Saturday fled for safety when some youths suspected to be #EndSARS attacked the division. Hundreds of protesters, who stormed the station around 2pm with placards with various inscriptions, damaged the building and four vehicles parked on the premises of the station. An eyewitness told our correspondent that some of the police officers in the station took to their heels on sighting the protesting youths. About 40 glasses of the station’s windows were shattered while its fences were in a shambles. Windscreens and side glasses of four vehicles parked were vandalised. The roof of a building close to the station, among others, was also destroyed. Commissioner of Police Babatunde Mobayo, who confirmed the incident, said the attack on the station was not only condemnable, barbaric but an onslaught against the police. Mobayo, in a statement by the police spokesperson, Sunday Abutu, said whether the attack was orchestrated by the EndSARS protesters or hijackers, the command would not tolerate violent protest in Ekiti. The statement reads:” On Saturday, 17th October, 2020, a group of hoodlums in their large numbers, in the name of protest, went wild and attacked Ikere Area Command as well as Ikere Divisional Police Headquarters, destroying items worth millions of naira in the process. “The Ekiti state Commissioner of Police, however, condemns such attack on Police properties and innocent citizens, noting that the attack could be described as barbaric, wicked and uncalled for.”
