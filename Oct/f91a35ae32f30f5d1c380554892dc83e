The Department of State Services (DSS) says it is ready to ensure a hitch-free governorship election on Saturday. Spokesman Dr. Peter Afunanya said in a statement that DSS will not only partner sister security agencies, but will also support the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to ensure that the poll is successful. It urged its personnel to remain professional while discharging their duties. “The Service enjoins players in the electoral process to abide by the rules of the game. Persons and groups that may wish to engage in violent activities, leading to a breakdown of law and order, are advised to desist from such devious plans or be ready to face the full wrath of the law,” the statement said.
