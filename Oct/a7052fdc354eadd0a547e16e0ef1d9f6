Business activities, vehicular and human movement in Ibadan, Ado-Ekiti and Abeokuta, Ogun State were on Monday paralysed as youths continued with the #EndSARS protest. Apata, Odo Ona, Orita Challenge, Akala Way, 110, Lam Adeshina Way, New Garage among other major areas of Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, were totally shut down by the protesters. Traffics in the areas were congested as workers who were on their ways to work suffered untold hardship as the protesters insisted that no one would go to work. But other major places, including Mokola, Idi-Ape, Iwo Road, Bodija, and other areas were calm earlier in the day. Most business and office activities were also brought to a halt in Ado-Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital, as the protest by youths took a new turn. The Nation gathered that the protesters resumed at the popular Fajuyi Park and divided themselves into groups. They thereafter operated from different locations. Economic and government activities in the Ado metropolis were halted as the protesters in clusters moved around and barricaded the strategic roads, including the one leading to Government House. Thousands of people were also on Monday morning stranded in different parts of Ogun, as the protesters resumed their protests. The protesters blocked the NNPC axis of the Abeokuta-Sagamu road, thus making it difficult for civil servants to resume for work at the Oke Mosan state secretariat. The Papalanto-Obada Oko end of the Lagos-Abeokuta expressway was also blocked, thus preventing vehicular movements inbound Abeokuta and outbound Lagos. The same scenario was witnessed at Pansheke and Camp areas of Abeokuta metropolis where the protesters mounted roadblock and prevented vehicular movements. The President of Theatre Arts and Motion Picture Producers Association of Nigeria (TAMPPAN), Mr Bolaji Amusan, said the association supported the protest, saying the police brutality must stop.
