The Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB),says any person or group inciting  the Yoruba against Igbo in the name of protest will never succeed. The group condemned the Young Yoruba Freedom YYF, led by one Adeyinka Grandson for posting an offensive video calling Igbo to quit Lagos or be killed to desist from such act. In a statement Saturday by the leader of MASSOB, Uchenna Madu, which was made to The Nation in Awka, the pro Biafra group said YYF should preach peace instead of inciting regions against each other. Madu, said MASSOB had worked and still working in alliance with Oodua People’s Congress (OPC) and other notable Yoruba self-determination and pressure groups for the betterment of the respective regions, adding that it was shocking to receive such red signal from its Oduduwa brothers. According to MASSOB, “It is well known that Ndigbo and Yorubas have lived, interacted and socialised in harmony with each other. “MASSOB stands for the self-determination emancipation for all regions of Nigeria. Igbo political leaders are in alliance with their counterpart in Yoruba land clamouring for true federalism and restructuring of Nigeria. “MASSOB advised the Young Yorubas for Freedom (YYF) and their collaborators to stop fanning the embers of discord and calumny among the southern brothers. “Ndigbo have never declared any aggression against the Yorubas or any other indigenous tribe in Nigeria. Ndigbo did not attack or destroy any government or private properties in Lagos.”
