 GOLDEN Eaglets’ head coach Fatai Amoo is hopeful for a swift football restart  post COVID-19 lockdown to begin preparation towards  the forthcoming WAFU/UFOA ‘B’ Under 17 event in Benin Republic. The Federal Government  imposed a lockdown on all sport-related  activities in the country since  the outbreak of Coronavirus pandemic  in March but Amoo has hinted about aggressive manhunt of cadet players as soon as the ban is lifted. “We are all under pressure because it is part of us. We are used to it. I am sure it is under that we are going to work too to raise a formidable team for the Golden Eaglets,” Amoo told our correspondent. “We cannot start anything for now because we do not have such directives. We can only wait and hope that very soon the Government will lift the ban imposed on football. We will make use of the time remaining judiciously as soon as the Government allows football to return.” WAFU/UFOA ‘B’ Under 17 Championship is billed for Benin Republic between December 5 and 20.
