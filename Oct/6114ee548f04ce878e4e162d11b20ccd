With the successful completion of its capital injection and balance sheet restructuring, the group recovered from pre-tax loss from continuing operations of N1.51 billion in 2018 to a pre-tax profit of N17.89 billion in 2019. Country Chief Executive Officer, Lafarge Africa Plc, Khaled El Dokani, said the performance of the company was due to its turnaround and cost-reduction strategy and the divestment of the South African business. According to him, the decrease in net debt has significantly strengthened the group’s balance sheet and has placed it in a vantage position to face the future. He noted that Lafarge Africa has taken necessary measures to protect the health of its employees, customers, suppliers and other stakeholders from the ravaging impacts of the Coronavirus pandemic. He pointed out that the construction sector and construction sites are generally more resilient than other sectors and Lafarge Africa has a strengthened balance sheet and is well equipped to weather the storm. He said the company is closely monitoring the evolving situation and the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic on the Nigerian market. He noted that the Nigerian cement industry growth momentum is expected to slow down in 2020 compared to 2019 on the back of the Coronavirus pandemic and the challenging global macro-economic environment. He said the group has launched an action plan-health, cost and cash to curtail the effect of the disruptions on its business adding that the group will continue to focus on the implementation of its cost optimisation initiatives during this period to minimise the impact on the business.
