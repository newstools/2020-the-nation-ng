Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has said he ignored warnings about his deputy, Agboola Ajayi and ensured he was well paid to make him comfortable. He said he gave him free hands to operate but was later betrayed . The governor, who spoke at a radio programme in Akure, said his deputy does not want to be patient. “No deputy governor has collected what he was collecting in the history of the state. I gave him N13million monthly. His predecessors did not collect as much as that. No deputy governor collects as much as that in Nigeria. I gave him enough room to operate, yet he betrayed me.”
