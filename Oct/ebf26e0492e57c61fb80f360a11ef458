The National Examination Council (NECO) has announced the rescheduling of the paper to be written tomorrow due to the inability of the delivery bus to deliver examination papers in some states. The delivery bus was held up by the #ENDSARS protest that locked the free movement of vehicles at the city entrance gate in Benin. This, according to a statement signed by the Head of Information and Public Relations Department, Azeez Sani has made it impossible for the delivery of examination materials to be delivered to some states. “This is to inform the general public and especially candidates that the National Examinations Council (NECO) has been constrained to reschedule the Paper I Computer Studies Practicals earlier scheduled to take place on Monday 19 October 2020, 10am to 1pm, for Monday 16 November 2020, 10am to 1pm. “This unforeseen incident has been caused by the ENDSARS protest that blocked the free movement of transport at the City entrance gate Benin. The NECO delivery truck had left its take-off point well in advance on Friday 16 October 2020, earlier to deliver examination materials to some states and has been held up in the blockage since then.” The statement said the affected examination materials have been retrieved and are intact adding that the decision was taken to maintain the integrity and security of the examination procedure of the examination body. “While regretting any inconveniences this rescheduling may cause our esteemed stakeholders, the  Council has however taken this decision in order to maintain the integrity and security of its examinations procedures for seamless conduct of the Council’s examination.”
