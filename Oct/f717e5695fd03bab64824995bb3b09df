A Federal High Court in Abuja has restrained the Inspector-General of Police and Delta State Police Commissioner from arresting or detaining ex-Minister of State for Education Kenneth Gbagi. Justice Taiwo Taiwo made the order in Suit FHC/ABJ/CS/1267/2020, following Gbagi’s ex-parte application for the enforcement of his fundamental rights. Gbagi’s application followed the controversy generated by the September 18 stripping of four employees of his hotel in Effurun near Warri, Delta State over alleged missing money. The court also granted Gbagi leave to serve the originating processes and all other subsequent processes in the suit on the Delta State Commissioner of Police by substituted means. The judge adjourned till October 16 for hearing.
