There was confusion in Abuja when hundreds of hoodlums on Sunday afternoon invaded the Idu Industrial Layout, raiding several warehouses in search of palliatives. An eyewitness told our correspondent the hoodlums made away with bags of rice, cartons of tin tomatoes, cereal, milk, bails of Ankara materials and other items. It was observed that despite the presence of policemen, the mob continued to plunder warehouses. The hoodlums were seen loading tricycles and motorcycles with the stolen goods as policemen fired teargas. Some hoodlums were on Saturday prevented from looting a warehouse at the UTC market, Area 10, Garki, Abuja.
