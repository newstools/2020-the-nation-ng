 THERE was tension on Monday in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital, over the death of two suspected cultists. The incident was said to have been an aftermath of the Sunday attack on #EndSARS protesters by suspected cultists around the General Post Office area in the metropolis. It was gathered that the head of one of the deceased was cut from the body and deposited on top of the General Post Office flyover in the metropolis. The second victim’s body was said to have been found around Unity area also in the state capital. The incident sent fears down the spines of many residents of the town in the early hours of yesterday, as some traders in Post Office and Challenge areas could not open their stalls for business. The beheaded victim was identified as Yusuf aka Lucifer and was said to have been involved in Sunday’s attack against the protesters, while the identity of the second victim was not yet known. Spokespersons for the police command and Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) Ajayi Okasanmi and Olasunkanmi Ayeni confirmed the incident. But Okasanmi said only one person, whose head was found atop the flyover, died in the incident, adding that the state police command had begun investigation. Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq yesterday held a meeting with first-class monarchs, to brief them on the minimum wage, developmental issues and security situation. AbdulRazaq, who hailed the traditional rulers for their support, said the administration respects the right of citizens to a peaceful protest.
