 THE Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike has approved the relocation of the State Sports Council from the Basketball Hostel to the Adokiye Amiesimaka Sports Complex in Igwuruta-Ali as its permanent site. The Commissioner for Sports Barrister Boma Iyaye said the approval for the relocation of the Council to a permanent site after its 51 years of existence signalled a new dawn in Sports promotion and development in Rivers State. The Sports Commissioner said the transit nature of the Council’s head office adversely affected its effort in preparing for championships and other national and international competitions, adding it  created major problems including communication challenges, disruption of effective implementation of policies and programmes in planning, training and execution, as well as resulted in damage to records, documents, materials and equipment. While maintaining that the move further attest to the commitment of Governor Wike in institutionalizing Sports development in Rivers State, Iyaye expressed gratitude to the Governor for relocating the Sports Council to the Sports Complex, which has ample space to accommodate its head office, association offices, equipment store, hostels, camping and training facilities. He noted that the new development would go a long way in boosting the performance index of the Council, athletes and officials in competitions and Sports promotion. The Sports Commissioner who directed the Permanent Secretary to work out modalities for smooth relocation, charged staff of the Sports Council to embrace the new arrangements and give their best in support of Governor Wike’s desire to take sports in the State to greater height.
