Social justice will form the focus of two days’ deliberations at the second session of the fifth synod of the Anglican Diocese of Lagos Mainland. It opens on Sunday afternoon at the Cathedral Church of St. Jude, Ebute Meta, Lagos. The Most Rev. Emmanuel Ogbunu, Bishop of Lokoja Diocese, will preach the sermon titled: ‘God, the Author of Social Justice’. On Monday morning, the official opening of the business session will hold at the same venue of the 14-year-old diocese. An annual festival of the bishop, the synod attracts delegates from churches in the diocese and friends from Christendom and civil society to examine issues facing the church and society. The Bishop of Lagos Mainland, Rt. Rev Akinpelu Johnson, as chief host, will preside over the deliberations and deliver a state-of-the-church-and-nation address. Recommendations will be drawn at the end and shared with members and the larger society to drive the focus of the church for the year.  It is the first time that the synod, which comes six months later than planned, will be condensed into a two-day celebration, as a consequence of the health and political challenges in the country.
