The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has warned private school owners and public school heads, who insist on collecting third term fees that they will be sanctioned. Chairman, FCT Secondary Education Board (SEB) Yahaya Mohammed stated this during inspection of schools yesterday for the 2020/2021 Academic session, after seven months of closure occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic. He said the administration is emphatic on the issue of third term school fees and would not hesitate to come down hard on either private schools or any head of public school that collect the fees. His words: “FCT Administration is very emphatic that this is first term resumption. So, no school, either Private or public, should collect third term fees. Those that violate the rules will certainly face sanction. “In our last meeting with the school management officials, National Association of Proprietors of Private Schools (NAPPS) were in attendance and had expressed the willingness to comply with the laid down rules and regulations by FCT Administration.” On adherence to COVID-19 safety protocols, Mohammed said the FCT Administration was doing all it takes to adhere to the COVID-19 safety guidelines across the schools. Mohammed explained that the number of students in a class should be between 25 and 35 depending on the size of the class and infrastructure available for use.
