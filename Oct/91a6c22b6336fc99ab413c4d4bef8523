  The General-Secretary of Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Barrister Joseph Daramola, has refuted news
making the rounds that the Ecumenical Centre is on fire. Daramola, who expressed disappointment over the rumour, warned that nobody should try anything funny at the Ecumenical Centre. Daramola, who spoke to our correspondent last night, said: “The AIT report is fake. I’m just coming out of the Ecumenical Centre now and there is no fire as reported.  “Some people called me about the incident and I rushed to the Ecumenical centre only to confirm that it is not true. I don’t know where AIT got its story from. “I’m using this to warn that anybody should try anything funny,” he said.
