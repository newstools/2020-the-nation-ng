Former Arsenal striker Nicklas Bendtner has lifted the lid on his on-pitch argument with Emmanuel Adebayor during a game against Tottenham in 2008. And he has admitted that he was never a big fan of his ex-teammate during his time in north London. Bendtner, now at Danish side Tarnby FF, has never been shy of confrontation, and he garnered a reputation of being something of a volatile figure during his six seasons with the Gunners. Things came to a head in a League Cup semi-final clash against Spurs at White Hart Lane, when he and Adebayor had to be separated after they came to blows in a disagreement. And speaking on Arsenal’s In Lockdown podcast, Bendtner made his feelings about his fellow forward crystal clear. “He’s not really my cup of tea,” Bendtner said. “I got on with most people in the team and made some really good friends, but me and him? Probably not so much.  “I remember him being substituted on and I think there was a key moment where I don’t think the ball had been passed to him. There was a heated exchange of words where a lot was said between us, and then we squared up to each other. “Then he sort of push headbutted me, so he sort of pushed me away while headbutting me on the nose. Then [William] Gallas came in, split us up and took us apart. “I was very upset. I mean, we had such a poor performance, I think we lost 5-1. I was disappointed enough with myself and the team about the performance we gave, so that [incident] obviously didn’t do anything to help.” “We tried to talk it through in the dressing room but not so much words… more something else. Then we got separated and called into the boss’ office the next day. We got fined and that was the end of it. We didn’t really have any encounters at all from that moment.
