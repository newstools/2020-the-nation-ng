An angry mob has beaten a suspected male lunatic, who abducted a one-year-old boy and attempted to run away with him, to coma. The mob rescued the baby at Nkworji Market, in Owerri North council area of Imo State. He was said to have abducted the boy near his mother’s stall in the market and was taking him to an unknown destination when he was accosted by curious passers-by along Owerri-Okigwe road. According to the market sources, the suspected lunatic was seen around the Nkworji area for some time. Eyewitnesses said the suspected lunatic, a man who regularly appeared in tattered clothes, had been loitering around Orji neigbourhood with residents believing he was mentally challenged until the incident. One of the witnesses, who simply identified herself as Adaora Nneji, said: “On Sunday, we spotted a man with a baby that is about a year old. “All of us were surprised to spot the mad man who had been moving alone before now, carry a baby within the Nkwo Orji area. The sight raised suspicions which prompted the people to gather around him. “During a brief interrogation, we discovered that the man was stuttering and talking incoherently as a mad man. “We discovered that the baby could have been a stolen one since the insane man couldn’t offer sufficient reasons of the ownership of the baby”. A drama ensued when the mother of the stolen child, who was among the crowd that gathered to witness the scene, was surprised to notice the baby was her child. The woman rushed to grab her child and started breastfeeding the baby before the crowd descended heavily on the suspect. According to the woman, she left for an errand but was surprised to find the insane man clutching her baby. The suspect was pummeled to a state of coma before the crowd disappeared thinking he had passed out as a result of the massive beating.
