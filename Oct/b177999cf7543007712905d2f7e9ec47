 BELGIUM midfielder Kevin De Bruyne believes England are capable of winning Euro 2020 and the 2022 World Cup. The Manchester City star is part of the Red Devils squad who take on the Three Lions in a UEFA Nations League game at Wembley on Sunday. Being part of the Premier League, De Bruyne has seen at first hand the talent that is currently in the England squad and is tipping them to make their mark at the next two major tournaments. “I think they should be very excited. It is a very young team with a lot of potential and I think they should aim to win the next Euros and World Cup – I think they have that potential,” he said. “There are always a lot of teams who want to win it, but I think the team they have, the players who play in top clubs, they should do that.” Belgium are currently the world’s top-ranked team and beat England twice at the 2018 World Cup but they will be without key men Dries Mertens and Eden Hazard on Sunday.
