Minority Leader of the Senate, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe has condemned President Muhammadu Buhari’s nomination of his media aide, Lauretta Onochie, as a National Commissioner of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Abaribe, who represents Abia South, described the nomination as a violation of the Constitution. He said the minority caucus of the Senate is against the nomination and called on Buhari to withdraw it. “President Buhari, by nominating Lauretta Onochie has willfully gone against the Constitution that he swore to uphold. “Item F, paragraph 14 of the Third Schedule of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) forbids a card carrying member of a political party to be a member of INEC. “The Minority Caucus of the Senate is against this nomination and call on Mr President to withdraw it,” Abaribe said in a terse statement in Abuja.
