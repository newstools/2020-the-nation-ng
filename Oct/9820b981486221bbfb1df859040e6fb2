SEYI Shay, Mr Eazi, Adekunle Gold, and Oxlade, are some of the Nigerian music stars currently out of the shores of the country that have joined the protest instigated by Nigerian youths to end police brutality. Seyi Shay and Mr Eazi joined the protest in London, as their colleagues in Nigeria joined the protesters at the Lekki tollgate. In the same vein, Adekunle Gold, who is far away in Houston, United States of America, alongside his wife and their child, and fast-rising act, Oxlade joined the protest in their present locations.  The music stars join a long list of Nigerian celebrities that have publicly expressed anger towards police brutality amidst other societal issues. The protest to end the infamous police unit, Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), has since escalated into a riot leaving major parts of Lagos shattered after two weeks.
