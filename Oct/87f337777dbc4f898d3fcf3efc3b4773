 THE new chairman of Yobe Desert Football Club Hon. Goni Bukar has vowed to work hard in his capacity to bring back the club into the top flight. Bukar, who is also the commissioner for Sports, Youth and Social Development in the state, said the relegation of the club last year from the premier league is unacceptable and his management ensures the club returns. The Nation recalls that the Damaturu-based outfit got promoted to the Nigeria Professional Football League(NPFL) in 2017 but only lasted for one season in the top flight football. “As you know, this is a big challenge that His Excellency, Gov. Mai Mala Buni has added to me by appointing me as the Chairman of Yobe Desert Football Club. In my capacity as a politician and the Honourable Commissioner of Sports, Youth and Social Development, my immediate objective is to return the team back to the premier league in the country. His Excellency has asked me to ensure that is done and with his support we are going to get things done without delay. “The players have started resuming to camp and new ones will be recruited. A formidable teaching crew will also be put in place within a very reasonable time to kick off the season on a sound beginning,” Bukar said. The chairman added that all NCDC protocols on COVID 19 guidelines were observed upon the return of the players.
