Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has stated that he is in government to serve, not for fame or money. He said that politicians must begin to prioritise the vehicle of governance to benefit the people, while political leaders must remain selfless for Nigeria to attain its full potential. Obaseki stated these Thursday in Benin, while speaking with Government House reporters. He pointed out that there was need for a mechanism to be put in place to ensure transparency in government. He said: “Only few persons in government are held accountable for their decisions in government. “I am not in government to make money. I am not in government for fame. I am in government to serve. The youths are the reasons why I am in government. If I cannot serve you, I will quit. “The issues of better government, proper governance and transparency are what we are emphasising. When we have younger people who can use technology in government, we will have transparency and accountability, which informed my decision to have many younger people working for my government. “For things to be working in Nigeria, there are structural challenges that we must fix. Let us not gloss over the cracks. Let us go to the foundation and begin to fix the conditions, because the cracks are expanding so wide.” Obaseki also stated that in a democracy, there was the need for an institution that would ensure law and order, thereby necessitating having security agencies. He said: “Our security arrangements in the country must reflect our federal system. “I cannot be a governor of a state and not able to hire and fire my commissioner of police, but #ENDSARS protests have helped us start the process.”
