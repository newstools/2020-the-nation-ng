Nigerian-born Canadian Minister for Justice, Kaycee Madu has supported ongoing #ENDSARS protests, narrating how his cousin was murdered in April 2013. Madu is the Minister of Justice and Solicitor General of Alberta, an oil rich state in Canada, North America. In series of tweets on his verified account, Madu said the police did not investigate the murder of his cousin, Chrisantus Nwabueze Korie, adding they did everything to obstruct. He wrote: “I support the people of Nigeria as they protest to end police brutality and extrajudicial killings. My own cousin Chrisantus Nwabueze Korie was murdered by Nigeria Police in April 2013. “Despite my best efforts, the police would not investigate his murder and did everything to obstruct. I also helped to petition a committee of Nigeria’s National Assembly to probe the killing and report back to the House within a timely manner. “Fundamental human rights like peace, security and freedom from police brutality are universal. The Nigerian government has an obligation to protect its citizens and deliver substantive police reform. “Changing the name of SARS and reconstituting it without significant reform won’t be sufficient to satisfy the cry of the Nigerian people for justice. “Edmund Burke wrote that, “the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.” I encourage all Nigerians to stand up and be heard.”
