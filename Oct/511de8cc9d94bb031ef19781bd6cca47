 The National Pension Commission (PenCom) has continued to embrace transparency and accountability as the regulator for the first time released its yearly report promptly for public consumption. PenCom broke a long-time record of failure to make its yearly report available for public scrutiny, as it rendered its last year’s report on October 16. Annual reports are financial statements that are published yearly and released to various parties and the  public. The reports assess the year’s operations, organisation’s view of the upcoming year, place and prospects. Both for-profit and not-for-profit organisations are mandated to produce yearly reports. The National Assembly and many observers have condemned some agencies and parastatals of the Federal Government for failing to be transparent and accountable. Findings show that the commission had not done well as a regulator in the release of its account for six years, between 2011 and 2017. It is noteworthy to state that this occurred during the past administration of the commission, despite applying fines and penalties against companies that fail to render accounts promptly. However, appeared under the Acting Director-General, Mrs Aisha Dahir-Umar, the commission released its reports of between 2012 and 2014 in December 2017. The commission further released 2015 report on February 6, 2018, 2016 report in March 21, 2018 and 2017 on December 18, 2018. To clean up its record, the commission released its 2018 report on February 6, 2020, with the latest release of last year’s report just three days ago. This is even as the commission has been consistent in monthly, quarterly and bi-yearly reports, the last being last June. Meanwhile, the 2019 report showed that the value of pension fund assets increased by N1.58 trillion or 18.27 per cent from N8.64 trillion as at December 31, 2018 to N10.22 trillion as at December  31, 2019. The Nation found that the growth was accounted for by inflows of pension contributions into the Retirement Savings Account (RSA) funds, which averaged N80 billion monthly and investment income. The report also indicated that the pension funds were invested in the Federal Government Securities, which included FGN Bonds, Treasury Bills and Agency Bonds. In all, they accounted for N7.34 trillion or 72 per cent of the total pension fund assets, as compared to 73 per cent in the corresponding period ended December 31, 2018. Meanwhile, Mrs Dahir-Umar said the commission conducted last year’s verification and enrolment for employees of the Federal Government Treasury-funded MDAs due to retire in the year. She said 11,102 prospective retirees were enrolled during the nationwide field exercise, while an additional 531 were enrolled during last year’s in-house enrolment, which brought the total number of prospective retirees enrolled in 2019 to 11,633. The financial implications in terms of accrued pension rights were forwarded to the Budget Office of the Federation, for need-based budgetary appropriation. Giving updates on the Retirement Benefits Bond Redemption Fund (RBBRF) Account, she stated that the balance in the RBBRF Account at the beginning of last year was N5.93 billion. She said: “A total sum of N107.23 billion was released into the RBBRF account by the Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation while the PFAs refunded  N432.71 million between January and December, bringing the total available funds for the payment of accrued pension rights to N113.59 billion. “A total sum of N109.57 billion was paid as accrued rights out of the RBBRF account to 26,415 retiring and deceased employees between January and December, leaving a closing balance of N3.55 billion in the RBBRF Account as at  December 31, 2019.” Also, on contributions received, she said: “A total of N1 trillion was received by the RSA ‘Active’ Funds in 2019. This represented pension contributions received by the various Funds as well as transfers between the Funds. Total funds received in Fund I was N12.91 billion as at 31 December 2019. This represented monthly pension contributions and transfers from Fund II in respect of contributors who opted to move to Fund I during the period.” “ Total Fund II contributions received during the period amounted to N477.27 billion while the total receipts in Fund III as at 31 December 2019 was N510.57 billion. This represented monthly pension contributions as well as transfers from Fund II in respect of contributors that attained the age of 50 years and had been moved from Fund II,” she added.
