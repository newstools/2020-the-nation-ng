The police have commenced removal of road barricades across Lagos State as Deputy Inspector General (DIG) in charge of Research and Planning Leye Oyebade inspected extent of damages from violent attacks. Oyebade, who is in Lagos at the instance of the Inspector General of Police (IG) Mohammed Adamu, said obstructions on major roads were being removed to create access for motorists especially those on essential duties. The DIG, who was led on the operational tour by the Lagos Police Commissioner (CP) Hakeem Odumosu, said the police were taking complete charge of security of lives and property in Lagos to prevent recurrence of violent attacks on the police, government and private individuals as seen in the last few days which left many lives lost and properties damaged.  A statement last night by spokesman for the police command, Olumuyiwa Adejobi said strategic places were visited like the attacked Correctional Custodial Centre, Ikoyi, which was partly set on fire by hoodlums. He said the extent of damage was examined and security fortified to prevent jail break. “The areas where the police chiefs cleared barricades include Falomo Round About, Sura-Adeniji and Ilubinrin end of the Third Mainland Bridge, Iyana Oworo and Gbagada end of Ikorodu Expressway, Oju Elegba (Surulere) and Apongbon Bridge, in the Lagos Island,” he said. Confirming the burning of Ikotun Police Station, Adejobi said CP Odumosu condemned the unprovoked onslaught by hoodlums, warning the command would not tolerate acts capable of undermining security and peace. “The command will neutralise any moves that can jeopardise security architecture vis-a-vis maintenance of law and order in Lagos State. “CP Odumosu further charged police officers and other security agents to be resolute in protection of lives and property and restoration of peace and public safety in the state,” he said.
