 THE United States Agency for International Development (USAID), in   collaboration  with Digital Frontiers, is empowering women innovators with $ 2 million. Digital Frontiers is awarding four grants of almost $500,000 each. To this end, both organisations have invited applicants to respond to the Women’s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative WomenConnect Challenge (W-GDP WCC) Round Three. The W-GDP WomenConnect Challenge is open to registered U.S. or non-U.S. organisations. Countries excluded from eligibility include Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria. Applicants must use W-GDP WomenConnect Challenge funds to implement a solution in a country with USAID presence. W-GDP seeks to reach 50 million women in the developing world by 2025 by focusing on three pillars – women prospering in the workforce, women succeeding as entrepreneurs and women enabled in the economy. Applicants will be required to include a private sector partner commitment letter in their application. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure long-term sustainability and to facilitate partnerships between the private sector and organisations hoping to bridge the gender digital divide at the grassroots level. .
