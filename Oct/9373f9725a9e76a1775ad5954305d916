WILLIAM Troost-Ekong and Ismaila Sarr delivered impressive performances as Watford played out a 1-1 draw against Bournemouth in Saturday’s Championship game. Troost-Ekong made his debut for the Vicarage Road outfit in their victory over Blackburn Rovers on Wednesday after teaming up with the club from Udinese in September. The Nigeria international was afforded his second appearance for the Hornets against Jason Tindall’s men and delivered solid defensive showings. His teammate and Senegal international Sarr also starred for Watford to help the club extend their unbeaten run to three games. Sarr inspired the opening goal when he set up Stipe Perica 12 minutes into the encounter and the forward beat goalkeeper Asmir Begovic to put his side in front. Both sides wasted a number of scoring chances and with the game looking to end in the way of Vladimir Ivic’s men, Chris Mepham scored a late equalizer to ensure the match ended in a draw. Troost-Ekong made one crucial block, won one aerial contest and made four clearances in his effort to help his side keep a clean sheet.
