The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Nasarawa has adopted Governor Abdullahi Sule as its sole candidate for 2023. The party has declared no member of the party in the state should contest against the Governor in 2023. Sule got this endorsement at the weekend when stakeholders from the Nasarawa West Senatorial zone led by the first civilian Governor and senator representing the zone, Abdullahi Adamu, assured no member of the party from the zone will contest against him come 2023. The Nasarawa West stakeholders made their resolve known while paying a solidarity visit on Sule at the Government House. Senator Adamu said the zone is satisfied with the leadership of Sule in terms of spreading the dividends of democracy across the state. Adamu said they were at the Government House specifically to commend the Governor for his exemplary leadership as well as restate their loyalty to his administration. “We are here to tell the world that we have nobody from our zone who will contest against you, you are our candidate come 2023,” he declared. He moved a motion in support of the resolution after which Assembly members from the zone seconded adoption of Sule as the candidate of the zone come 2023. The Governor expressed gratitude for the show of love by the Nasarawa West Senatorial zone, stressing his major desire was to ensure peace and unity in the state. The Governor said he will remain grateful to his predecessor Senator Umaru Tanko Al-Makura, who supported him throughout the journey to the Government House.
