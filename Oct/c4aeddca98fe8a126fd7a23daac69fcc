 OGUN Government has announced the beginning of its community-based COVID-19 testing across the 20 local government areas. The first round of the community sampling was carried out in April at the peak of the pandemic across the stateâ€™s local government areas. Commissioner for Health Dr. Tomi Coker stated this on Monday in Abeokuta. She said the decision to domesticate COVID-19 testing in the 20 local government areas centred on the national recommendation of community-based testing. The commissioner stressed that it was a new means to improving early case detection and treatment of both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. Coker added that the exercise, which is free of charge, will begin on Oct. 8, with mobile testing in five major markets in each council before locating it at the designated Primary Health Care Centre (PHC). She added that the government had solicited the support of ward/community leaders to assist in mobilising their communities for the programme.
