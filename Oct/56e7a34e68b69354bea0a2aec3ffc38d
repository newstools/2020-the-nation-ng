A Federal High Court in Abuja has admitted in evidence $25,000 cash allegedly returned by Senator Shehu Sani to a business man, Alhaji Sani Dauda of ASD Motors Limited, from whom he allegedly collected it under false pretence. Senator Sani is being tried before the court on charges relating to his alleged obtaining of $25,000 from Alhaji Dauda under false pretence, claiming that the said funds would be used to bribe judges. Alhaji Dauda had, while testifying earlier in the case, told the court that Senator Sani later returned the money on learning that he petitioned the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The complainant also said he recorded the conversations between him and Senator Sani when he returned the money and begged him for forgiveness. Testifying on Wednesday as the 10th prosecution witness, an EFCC’s operative, who is the Investigative Police Officer (IPO) in the case, Bako Aliyu said Alhaji Daudu brought the cash to his office, claiming it was returned to him by Senator Sani. Lead prosecution’s lawyer, Ekele Iheanacho tendered the cash and some compact disc, which the witness said contain audio recordings of the conversations between the complainant and the defendants. The court admitted the items in evidence and adjourned till December this year for the discs to be played in open court. Details shortly.
