 ANAMBRA State Physical Planning Board (ANSPPB) has warned staff against comprising standard in the course of their assignments. Executive  Chairman of the Board, Barr. Chike Maduekwe, gave the warning during the demolition of a building that partially collapsed recently in Obuofia, Umuota Village, Obosi in Idemili North Council Area of the state. He said any staff of the organisation found guilty of financial inducement would be dismissed. “Anywhere you see our staff demanding bribe from you, call me or come to the office and report. Any staff we find compromising quality of work we are doing will be sacked,” he warned. Maduekwe explained that the demolition exercise was to forestall further calamity and ensure no other persons occupied the remaining section of the building. He said, “Two weeks ago, there was a partial collapse of the building that killed a couple. Miraculously, their six children survived without a scratch. “When a building is structurally compromised, the first thing is to secure lives of people around, especially those looking for where to squat by bringing the building down completely to avert further calamity.”
