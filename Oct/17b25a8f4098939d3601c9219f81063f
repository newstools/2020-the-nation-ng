ZLATAN IBRAHIMOVIC scored twice in three minutes as in-form AC Milan beat rivals Inter to maintain their winning start to the Serie A season. The 39-year-old tapped in to open the scoring after Samir Handanovic saved his penalty and made it two moments later from Rafael Leaoâ€™s smart cross. Romelu Lukaku pulled one back for Inter before the half-hour mark and was denied a penalty in the second half. AC Milan held on to make it four wins from four and stay top of the table. Some 1,000 fans were allowed inside the San Siro as Ibrahimovic made his return to the AC Milan side after a period of isolation following his positive Covid-19 test.
