 There are strong indications that Super Eagles Coach Gernot Rorh may have decided to consider home-based players for the AFCON 2022 Qualifiers against Sierra Leone next month. The German tactician was particularly impressed with the new players that featured in the friendly matches against Algeria and Tunisia while acknowledging the absence of key players. “After the camp in Austria we knew the new players. Good satisfaction on the goalkeeping position, défense will be stronger with the two new boys from Germany and Porto. But we need also our missing midfielders and the goal scorer,” he said. “We have to check for the injured players like Joe Aribo, Samuel Kalu and Wilfred Ndidi. Probably only one of them will be fit for next month.”  Rohr promises to return to Nigeria to examine some home-based players for the tie. “I will come soon to Nigeria and see the local players and there is a possibility of inviting two or three of them to be part of the team.” He described the friendly as a good preparation for the team ahead of AFCON qualifiers. “The two friendly games we played were very good competitive games. Algeria and Tunisia are very good teams. Indeed the results could have been better. We could have picked a draw against Algeria and a win against Tunisia,” he added. The former Bayern Munich star was however optimist of Super Eagles’ qualification for AFCON next month. The team is expected to assemble next month for the AFCON qualifiers against Sierra Leone as the team is topping the group L with six points having two of their matches against Benin Republic and Lesotho. Nigeria will host the first leg of the match against Sierra Leone on November 9 while the second leg takes place in Freetown on November 17.
