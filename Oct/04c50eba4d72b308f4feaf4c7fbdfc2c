Former Chairman of the Pension Reform Task Team (PRTT), Malam Abdulrasheed Maina, has expressed readiness to use his technical expertise to recover not less than $10bn for the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari within 30 days. Maina made this statement in commemoration of the 60th Independence Anniversary from his hospital bed after surgery. The statement signed by Maina’s Media Aide, Aliyu Musa, said the former Pension boss believes such money could help fix infrastructure deficits, fuel subsidy and ameliorate the electricity tariff which will ultimately put the looming industrial action by Nigerian workers to a halt. “Maina indicated that, he is ready to start the recovery as soon as he fully recovers from the surgery he just had last week. “The former Pension Boss further indicated that, he can only make the recovery of the said funds directly to President Buhari, as he expressed fear that, the money may be re-looted if not properly managed. “Maina has assisted successive administrations, especially that of Former President Jonathan where he recovered N1.6trillion and in President Buhari’s administration, where he recovered N1.3trillion and several movable and immovable properties,” Maina said.
