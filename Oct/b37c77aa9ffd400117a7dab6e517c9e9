Commissioner for Special Duties, Government House, Asaba in Delta Chief Henry Sakpra has denied scheming to thwart the hopes for an Urhobo indigene to emerge as Governor in 2023. He told reporters in Ekete, Udu council area of Delta those peddling such information are only seeking to drag his political career in the mud and pitch him against Governor Ifeanyi Okowa. Sakpra, while addressing members of the Urhobo Youths Leaders Association (UYLA), assured he is not ignorant of the gubernatorial “rotation arrangement” of the state, which tilts towards Delta Central, the Urhobo populated senatorial district. “The matter is nothing but a malicious and dangerously concocted tale by moonlight to the effect that I was working to undermine the interest of the Urhobo nation in the 2023 gubernatorial polls by aligning forces with those outside Delta Central, with intention of being running mate to some gubernatorial tendencies. “As a politician of note in Delta state and a serving member of the State Executive Council, I cannot be ignorant of the rotation arrangement in place which gravitate the position of governor to Delta Central in 2023. “As an illustrious Urhobo son, nothing gladdens my heart better than the opportunity for an Urhobo to yet again produce the governor of Delta state. “These rumours are characterised by strong underlying political subterfuge, thoughtless strategies and technically unsound infantile tantrums designed to drag me on the path of infamy. “The promoters of this propaganda against my interest are working with political war-lords from within and outside our political party to whip up sentiments against me in order to bring me down,” the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain stated.
