Experienced defender Kenneth Omeruo and striker Moses Simon led 11 other stars to the Super Eagles’ Hotel die Zeit an der Glan in Austria yesterday ahead of the international friendly matches against African champions Algeria and Africa’s number two –ranked team, Tunisia. Omeruo and Simon were joined by Samuel Kalu, Chidera Ejuke, Leon Balogun, Mathew Yakubu, William Ekong, Oluwasemilogo Ajayi, Olaoluwa Aina, Kelechi Iheanacho, Dele Alampasu, Jamilu Collins, Frank Onyeka, Cyril Dessers and Alex Iwobi. The other invited players were being expected in camp late on Monday. Ahead of his imminent switch to Nigeria, former Germany U20 captain Kevin Akpoguma arrived at the team’s hotel in Austria to familiarise with the Nigeria set-up and bond with other players. Nigeria will file out against the in-form Algeria at the Jacques Lemans Arena on Friday before taking on 2004 African champions Tunisia at the same venue on Tuesday next week.  Coach Gernot Rohr will do without three of his initial invitees, with Turkey –based midfielder Oghenekaro Etebo suffering a knock on Sunday, following earlier injury to Wilfred Ndidi and permission granted Italy –based forward Victor Osimhen to sit out the matches. It is the first gathering of the Super Eagles this year, with the coronavirus pandemic shutting down football globally since March, just before a quick-fire double AFCON qualifying series with Sierra Leone that will now hold in November. Match organisers, Eurodata Sport have said that no fan will be allowed inside the stadium for any of the two matches, in conformity with extant protocols on the coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has called on television stations interested in bringing the matches live to the homes of Nigerians to contact the Federation on the modalities to achieve this.
