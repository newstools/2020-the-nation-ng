 Saudi Arabia Premier League side Al Nassr has announced the departure of Super Eagles Captain Ahmed Musa from the club. The Najd’s Knight announced they have parted ways with the former Leicester City and CSKA Moscow winger on Sunday after his two-year stint. It is unclear why both parties decided to part ways, but reports claimed Musa, 28, is eager to return to Europe, and the 8th time Saudi Arabia league champions do not want to stand in his way. The club, however, sent their best wishes to the player in a post on their social media handle, after confirming his exit.  “Thank you Nigerian falcon, wishing you all the best in the future Ahmed Musa!,” Al Nassr said in a tweet.  Musa signed a four-year contract with Al Nassr after leaving the English Premier League side Leicester City, but he is now free to join any club of his choice. He made 58 appearances for the club in all competitions, scored 11 goals, and recorded 14 assists. He departed Saudi Arabia as the 2018-19 Saudi top-flight champions and the 2019 Saudi Super Cup winners.
