Walt Disney Parks and Resorts has taken ownership of businesses in the Moroccan pavilion at the EPCOT theme park in the US state of Florida, WDW News Today reported. The move came after the Walt Disney corporation filed a legal complaint to recover some debt from the company that operated the facilities before the transfer of ownership. Before Disney’s claims against the company managing the Moroccan pavilion, the attraction had applied for a loan of $1-2 million under the Paycheck Protection Program. The loan aimed to preserve 260 jobs.  Despite the gradual reopening of the EPCOT theme park, the majority of attractions in the Moroccan pavilion were unable to resume activity due to financial difficulties. Only the Spice Road Table restaurant, the museum, and a few shops are open. Under normal circumstances, the pavilion offers several attractions, exhibitions, restaurants, and juice bars that offer visitors Moroccan-themed entertainment, food, and drinks. It also features replicas of some historical monuments such as Marrakech’s Koutoubia Mosque, Rabat’s Bab Chellah, and Fez’s Bab Boujloud. Morocco has actively promoted the pavilion for decades. The country’s embassy in the US and its tourism office will continue to collaborate and consult with the pavilion’s operators.
