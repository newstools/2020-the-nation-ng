Former Liverpool striker Luis Suarez was left in tears over the way Barcelona treated him before his exit from the Camp Nou. The Uruguay star, who left Anfield for the Catalan giants in 2014, ended an incredibly successful spell at the club in September this year. The 33-year-old says he was blocked from training with the first team and cried before his departure to Atletico Madrid – as Diego Simeone’s side paid a nominal fee of no more than €6million for the talisman  “Those days were very difficult. I cried because of what I was having to go through,” Surarez told the BBC. “I was hurt most of all by the way they did things, because one has to accept it when a cycle comes to an end.” Suarez joined Barca from Liverpool in a £74m move, becoming the European heavyweights’ third all-time top scorer with 198 goals in just 283 appearances while winning four La Liga titles, four domestic cups and the 2015 Champions League in the process.
