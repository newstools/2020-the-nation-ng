IT was a situation of different strokes for different folks for the three Nigeriaâ€™s players at Watford who were beaten 1-0 yesterday by Reading at the Majeski Stadium in a Championship tie. Tom Dele-Bashiru who made his senior debut in the league last weekend in their 1-0 home win over Luton Town started the game with Reading but was forced off injured in the 37th minute and replaced by Ken Sema.  William Troost Ekong who only moved to Watford this week was rooted to the bench for the duration of the fixture but Isaac Success is still to figure for the Hornets this season. Watford have seven points from four games and they will face Derby County next on Friday in another Championship tie.
