The leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, has said he is in possession of the original Aburi accord tapes, “which will vindicate the late Chukwuemeka Odimegwu Ojukwu and Biafra before the world.” The Aburi accord is an official record of the minutes of the meeting of Nigeria’s military leaders held in Aburi, Ghana shortly before the outbreak of the Nigeria-Biafra civil war. Kanu claimed yesterday in a statement by IPOB Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful that he possessed the original Aburi accord tapes, whose content would shock the world. He said the tapes would vindicate Dim Chukwuemeka Odimegwu Ojukwu and Biafra.  Kanu said the tapes had startling revelations of what transpired on that day, which he said would shock the British Government and media. “Our eternal leader Dim Chukwuemeka Odimegwu Ojukwu and Biafra are about to be vindicated before the world. All the lies concocted against Ojukwu and Biafra by the BBC and world media are about to be blown out of the water. “A very massive earthquake is coming. Britain, Gowon, Nigeria and the media are about to receive the greatest shock of their lives,” he said.
