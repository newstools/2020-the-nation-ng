 THE Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Tuesday gave the national leadership of the party one week ultimatum to zone the 2023 presidential ticket of the party to the Southeast. It said in a statement in Abakaliki by the state Chairman, Onyekachi Nwebonyi that this has become imperative since the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has announced the date for the 2023 general election. The party also made case for the re-election of Prince Uche Secondus as the national chairman. “We therefore enjoin the party, in whatever arrangement, not to tamper with the seat of the national chairman. Having performed well, leading the party to victories, Secondus deserves a second term. This is not negotiable,” Nwebonyi said. He said the party should, in the interest of justice, equity and fairness, zone the presidential ticket to the Southeast. The chairman said the geopolitical region had personalities who had performed well in public service. “We have the likes of Senator Pius Anyim, Mr. Peter Obi, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo Iweala, Senator Theodore Orji and Senator Ike Ekweremadu who have records that speak volumes,” he said.
