 THE House of Representatives Committee on Aviation has raised a number of questions on what it called the lopsided agreement on the planned concession of four major airports in the country. The lawmakers queried the agreement with the concessionaires on the sharing of the revenue for Lagos, Port Harcourt, Abuja and Kano airports. The decision followed complaints from various quarters, especially the unions and workers of Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), that the concessions were not in the interest of the nation as they are said to be detrimental to the country and the benefit of the concessionaires. The House committee has thus invited Aviation Minister Hadi Sirika to give details on the deal. The minister recently confirmed that the Federal Government had begun the process and that he had received the certificate of compliance from the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC) for the concession of the airports. A source told our correspondent that the concessionaires are to share the revenue on a 60-40 percentage with the FAAN getting 40 per cent and bearing all the liabilities. Chairman of House Committee on Aviation, Nnoli Nnaji (PDP Enugu), urged Sirika to furnish the committee with certain documents next Monday. Some of the documents the committee requested for are: a copy of the outline business case for the concession; a copy of the loan agreement for the airports; the evaluation report for the concession, as submitted to ICRC. Also, the committee requested for a copy of the report of the project delivery team, and the report of transaction advisor as well as asset valuation report of the airports. Similarly, the committee asked for a cash flow of the airports (up for concession) for the last five years and copies of existing concessions of the airports, if any. The minister is to also avail the lawmaker the investment plan of all the intending concessionaires and their projections.
