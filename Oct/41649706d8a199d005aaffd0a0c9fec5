 THE leadership of Usmanu Danfodiyo University, Sokoto, has debunked  claims that the institution is recruiting academic and non academic staff members. The disclaimer was issued in a statement sent through the Office of the Registrar, Establishments Division and signed by the Establishments Officer, Mr  M. S. Kabir. The university said it neither issued the advertisement nor authorised anyone to issue it on the school’s behalf. The statement reads: “The attention of the management of Usmanu Danfodiyo University, Sokoto has been drawn to a purported advertisement for recruitment circulating in the social media platforms. “The university wishes to state categorically that this institution has neither issued the advertisement nor authorised anybody to issue it on its behalf. University advertisements are only placed on the university website or in national dailies.” The university, however, advised everyone to visit the school website for genuine information. “The public is advised to always endeavor to access genuine information about the university by visiting our website,” it said.
