The son of a FIFA World Cup winner, Marcus Thuram is writing his own story in the Bundesliga with Borussia Monchengladbach. Making his professional debut for Sochaux at the age of 17, it took Thuram just a few months to claim the first silverware of his career. He scored the second goal in a 2-0 final win over Lyon at the Stade de France as Sochaux lifted the 2015 Coupe Gamberdella – France’s national U19 cup competition. After two further years in the French second tier, Thuram joined Guingamp in 2017, scoring his maiden Ligue 1 goal – once again against Lyon – on just his second start in the league. While the 2017/18 season was about finding his feet in the top flight, 2018/19 saw him star despite Guingamp’s struggles. They would finish bottom of the league but Thuram made a name for himself with nine goals, representing almost a third of his team’s total. Thuram is the son of France legend Lilian Thuram. The most capped player in the history of Les Bleus, Lilian won the 1998 FIFA World Cup and UEFA EURO 2000 as part of a career that saw him regarded as one of the best defenders of his generation. It’s a large shadow to step out of, but Marcus began to do so in January 2019 when he made headlines in the Coupe de la Ligue quarter-final. Minutes after he missed a penalty against Paris Saint-Germain, Guingamp fell behind.
