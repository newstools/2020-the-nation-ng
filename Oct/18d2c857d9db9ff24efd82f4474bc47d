 THE Muslim Community of Lagos State (MCLS) has called on the Nigerian government and citizens, to ensure that calm and peace remain watchword, as the country cannot afford further loss of lives and properties. Its President, Prof Tajudeen Gbadamosi backed call for prompt investigation and prosecution of those responsible for the killings during the protests. He said: “We should not only to ensure justice for the victims but also to prevent a repeat of such avoidable loss of human life. Our value for human life must precede other considerations. “As the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA) has reminded us, Islam places a high premium on life and forbids violence and wanton destruction of property. In the light of this, we renew our appeal to all, especially the aggrieved group and rampaging youths, to calm down and embrace peace and order in our communities. “Violence in any form detracts from the nobility of a cause. Destroying social amenities only makes our living conditions worse. We all lose when our few amenities are destroyed.  Surely, we all agree that there is no virtue in killing ourselves; there is no virtue in destroying our properties and legacies; there is no virtue in violence and anarchy; there is no virtue in cutting our nose to spite our face. “Once again, we appeal for calm and peace in our state and country. We appeal for law and order, more so when the government has listened to the demands of the protesters and shown willingness to examine and proffer acceptable solutions to the issues raised. It is therefore imperative for all sides to embrace peace.” Prof Gbadamosi appealed again to all sides to go to the negotiating table and secure “agreement on modalities, strategies and timelines” to achieve objectives.
