 YOBE State Governor Mai Mala Buni has called on youth in the state and the northeast region to refrain from joining the ongoing #EndSARS protest across the country. The governor spoke at the lunching of the State/Guaranty Trust Bank partnership under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) office. Buni, who addressed 200 young beneficiaries of the partnership, said the state had seen enough from the Boko Haram crisis and would not risk the peace it is currently enjoying. “We have had our own bad times during the Boko Haram period. Those protesting in other parts of the country do not know what we went through in the hands of Boko Haram. We are all witnesses to the atrocities of these insurgents, which forced many of us out of our comfort zones. “Violence does not pay in any form. As you can see, people are taking advantage of the situation and are exploiting their differences against the government. It is not possible to satisfy everyone.”
