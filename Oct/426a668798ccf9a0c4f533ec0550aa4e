 THE Godwin Obaseki administration in Edo State has begun the recruitment of teachers for the state’s rural and riverine communities under the Edo Supporting Teachers to Achieve Results (EdoSTAR) teaching fellowship programme. EdoSTAR is a three-year intensive training and field experience employment programme for teachers and aspiring teachers who will be transited into the state civil service upon satisfactory job performance in the programme. Executive Chairman of the state Universal Basic Education Board, Dr. Joan Osa Oviawe, announced this yesterday in a statement in Benin, the state capital. She explained that the EdoSTAR teaching fellowship programme is open to persons with or without teaching qualifications. “Those who have not received their teaching qualifications will be required to attain their Post-Graduate Diploma in Education (PGDE) or Professional Diplola in Education (PDE) through the Edo State College of Education during the first two years of the programme. “The EdoSTAR Teaching Fellowship Programme comes with salary and performance-based incentives and bonuses,” Oviawe said.
