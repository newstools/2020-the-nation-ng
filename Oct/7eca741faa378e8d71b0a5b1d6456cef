A former management employee of Odu’a Investments Ltd., Mr. Abiodun Adedeji, has sued the company at the National Industrial Court, alleging wrongful termination of his appointment. He also alleged oppression, discrimination and misrepresentation of facts to the board of the company. At the resumed hearing at the Ibadan division of the court, Justice J. Peters frowned at the way bailiffs were treated at the company when they went to serve summons. But counsel to the company, Mr. Adebayo Adenipekun (SAN) of Afe Babalola Chambers, explained that the Group Managing Director (GMD) and Company Secretary, who were respondents in the case, were attending the company’s Annual General Meeting at the time, stressing that they were not aware of what transpired between the bailiffs and security officers. He added that the GMD could not appear in court on Wednesday because he was stuck outside Ibadan due to the #EndSARS protests. Justice Peters adjourned hearing till November 25.
