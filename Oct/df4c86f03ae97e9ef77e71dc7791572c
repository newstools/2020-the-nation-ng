Inter Milan dropped their first two points of the season when they were held to a 1-1 draw by Lazio in a bad-tempered Serie A match on Sunday. Tempers flared in the second half of the game, which saw one player from each side sent off. Lautaro Martinez gave Inter the lead on the half-hour after the ball ran loose in the penalty area and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic equalised for the hosts, 10 minutes after the break. Lazio had forward Ciro Immobile, top-scorer in Serie A last season, sent off after 70 minutes following a clash with Inter midfielder, Arturo Vidal. The Chilean, who seemed to have reacted theatrically to what seemed like nothing more than a prod, was shown yellow. Inter, who have seven points from three games, also finished with 10 men, as Stefano Sensi was dismissed following a clash with Gil Patric. Lazio, fourth last season, have four points from three games. (Reuters/NAN)
