Operatives of the Ekiti State Security Network Agency codenamed Amotekun corps have arrested a suspected kidnapper in Ifaki-Ekiti, Ido-Osi Local Government Area of the state. The Amotekun corps commander Brig.-Gen Joe Komolafe (retd) told newsmen in Ado-Ekiti, the state capital, on Monday that the suspect, clad in military camouflage, was arrested during routine patrol. Komolafe said that upon interrogation, the 23-year-old suspect confessed that he was not a soldier but a kidnapper. The Corps commander said the suspect has been handed over to the police for further investigation and prosecution. “We arrested him in Ifaki when while on routine patrol. He was dressed in military uniform and coming out from the bush. The first name the supect gave us was Adebayo Damola and later he said he is Emmanuel Tunde. You can see the inconsistency in his words. He is never a military man but a suspected kidnapper. “Upon interrogation, he claimed to be from Kogi state, that he is a vulcaniser residing in Oye Ekiti. When asked about his mission in Ifaki, he said he was coming from Ado where he went to attend Man ‘ O War  interview.  Our further investigation shows that he resides in Ifaki and when he took us to his room, where we found military items. He also claimed that a military officer in Lagos state gave him the military uniform.” The Amotekun boss revealed that the governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi will be launching the new security outfit on October 19, saying the outfit is battle-ready to rid the state of kidnappers, armed robbers and other criminal-minded elements.
