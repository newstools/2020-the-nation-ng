Bayern Munich’s search for a new winger appears to have reached its natural conclusion with Douglas Costa re-joining the Bavarian side on loan from Juventus. The 31-year-old joins Douglas Costa as what will likely become Bayern’s last two signings of the transfer window. Costa played for Bayern under Pep Guardiola from 2015 onwards, moving to Juventus in 2018 on loan initially, before making the deal permanent that same year. Costa has been searching for a club all window after he was not considered by Juve manager, Andrea Pirlo for the new season.
