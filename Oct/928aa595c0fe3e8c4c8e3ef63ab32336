 THE All Progressives Congress (APC), Oyo State chapter, has congratulated President Muhammadu Buhari, APC National Leader Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and the national leadership of the party on the re-election of Ondo State Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu. It urged Governor Seyi Makinde to tender an apology to the people for bringing the name of the state into what it described as ‘public opprobrium’ through infractions and meddling in the appointment of a chief returning officer for the Ondo governorship election. The party in a statement by its Publicity Secretary, Dr. AbdulAzeez Olatunde, said the re-election of Akeredolu was an attestation of the will of the people of Ondo State not to allow the progress witnessed in the four years of APC government to be retarded. The party said: “One good turn deserves another. No wonder the good people of Ondo State defied the rain and the reactionary agents to speak with their votes in an overwhelming manner to give another four years mandate to APC in the governorship election. “The people of Ondo State had passed through horrific governance experience under PDP for 12 years and had been surprised at the unparalleled achievements and development under APC government ably led by Governor Akeredolu for only four years (2016-2020) and as such would not allow their progress to be retarded again. “On behalf of the APC members in Oyo State, we wish Governor Akeredolu another landmark achievements in his second term tenure. “We also congratulate Ade Adetimehin- led APC state executives in Ondo State for this victory.”
