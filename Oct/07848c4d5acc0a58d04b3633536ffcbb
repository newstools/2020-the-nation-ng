Motorists plying the Effurun/DSC Roundabouts sections of the East-West Road in Uvwie council area of Delta have been on a standstill following the crowd of #EndSARS protesters on the major highway. The protesters, who trooped out in large numbers, converged on the popular Effurun roundabout at about 7am Sunday, grounding vehicular movement. The sight was no different at the DSC Roundabout as vehicular movements were at a standstill. Scores of pedestrians, most of which were returning from church services, were seen walking across one end of the roundabout to another as the protesters barricaded all entrances. Motorists and commuters from Rivers and Bayelsa as well as intrastate road users, are seeking alternative routes. Some commuters had to alight at a point and board other vehicles to continue their journeys. A good number of private and commercial vehicles, including tricycles, had small tree branches on their windscreens, showing solidarity for the protest. Most of the protesters bore the national flag as well as placards with several inscriptions written on them. Some of the inscriptions read: “If we don’t get the reform we need, we won’t stop protesting,” Soro soke #EndBADGOVERNANCE, #EndPOLICEBRUTALITY,” Fight for tomorrow now,” EndSARS, EndSWAT, among others. They also demanded justice for slain victims of police brutality in Delta state and across Nigeria. A commercial vehicle operator, who spoke in support of the protesters, said: “Why won’t they protest? Why won’t I support them? Do you like the condition of things? “I am here, no job. They graduate from school and no job. The government is taking it all. Things that are meant for all of us, they suppress them. We are tired”. Passersby also rooted for the protest with supporting comments such as “enough is enough of Police oppressing us,” we will trek, let government here them because it affects all of us…”
