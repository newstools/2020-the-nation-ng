The Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) on Thursday celebrated the country’s 60th anniversary by asking for three things of government and Nigerians. They are: respect for the Constitution and Rule of Law, the obedience of all court orders, and respect for fundamental rights. NBA President Olumide Akpata stated this in a statement shared on his Twitter handled titled ‘Nigerian Bar Association – Diamond Jubilee Message’ He said: “The Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) joins all Nigerians in celebrating the grand occasion of the 60th Anniversary of our great nation as an independent and sovereign entity “It seems just like a few years ago that we celebrated the 50th anniversary of our independence in 2010. Alas, like a famous poet noted, time’s winged chariot hurries ever near.” Akpata added that while Nigerians have “abundant reasons to celebrate our continued existence as a nation”, recent events have tested the people’s collective resolve.
