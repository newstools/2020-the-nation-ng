 IF one looks at it deeply, the roles of traditional rulers are complex than what many think. They are charged with the responsibilities of maintaining peace and ensuring growth in their kingdoms. Recently, the Olootunja of Ootunja-Ekiti, Oba Joseph Adelola Fagbamila, along with some top personalities paid Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti a special visit. They thanked the governor, expressed their love for him and sought his support in the development of Ootunja land. On behalf of the delegation, President of Ootunja Sons and Daughters Association, Professor Peter Adeniyi, said the original plan of the community was to organise a reception in honour of the governor after his electoral victory in 2018 but events overtook it.  The former Vice-Chancellor of Federal University of Technology, Akure, and the Chairman of the Governing Council of Ekiti State University, also used the opportunity of the visit to intimate the governor about the new Ootunja Town Project. He stated: “The current Ootunja town is already chocked up to the extent that our sons and daughters now move to Ijesha-Isu road, Oke Ijebu /Oke Ayedun road, Odo Oro road, amongst others to buy lands for their residential developments.”
