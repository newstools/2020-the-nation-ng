Troops of Operation Sahel Sanity killed 38 bandits and arrested 93 of their collaborators in the Northwest between September 4 and October 25, the military said on Monday. Acting Director, Defence Media Operations, Brigadier-General Bernard Onyeuko told newsmen at Army Super Camp 4 Faskari, Katsina State, that the 93 suspects supplied logistics to bandits. Assorted weapons were recovered from the bandits, he said. Speaking further, he said 131 cows, 154 sheep and one camel were recovered, adding that 108 kidnapped victims were rescued. “In furtherance of the Nigerian Army’s mandate to completely rid the Northwest zone of the country of armed bandits, cattle rustlers, kidnappers and incessant killings of innocent citizens, the gallant troops of Operation Sahel Sanity have intensified operational activities in the theatre of operation during the period under review,” Onyeuko said’’. “This has led to the degradation of the bandits and their activities to the barest minimum as indicated by the successes recorded. These gains are gradually bringing stability and normalcy back to the zone as evident by the massive resumption of farming and socio-economic activities.” The defence spokesman appreciated the efforts of people who provided credible information leading to the success of the operation.
