 Breaking down non-tariff barriers is vital to better trade and stronger African integration. To this end, the African Union (AU) and United Nations  Conference on Trade and  Development (UNCTAD) are seeking ways to help people trade easier, the  UNCTAD has said. In a statement said the AU, UNCTAD and other partners are on a mission to ease trade on the continent and make the African Continental Free Trade Area a viable reality for economic development. According to the statement, one way to do so is to eliminate a costly and complex suite of irritants to freer trade: non-tariff barriers (NTBs). “Their elimination could provide a $20 billion boost to African economies each year – much more than the $3.6 billion that can be gained by eliminating tariffs, according to UNCTAD Tomorrow, the AU will host a webinar on how this could be realised in the Southern African region, part of a series of webinars across the continent under a new “trade easier”campaign. The webinar will focus on how best to overcome non-tariff barriers to trade”. On the components of NTBs, it stated that include regulatory and procedural barriers such as customs operations and border documentation requirements, rules of origin documentation, pre-shipment inspections, transport regulations, sanitary and phytosanitary measures and technical barriers to trade. The webinar  The Nation learnt, would bring together businesses, including micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, youths and women from Southern Africa to share their real-life experiences and exchange views on easing trading across the continent.  In add, The Nation learnt that a special focus will be on their experience of using the AU’s trade barriers platform.
