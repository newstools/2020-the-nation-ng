 Nigerian music acts, Mountain Black of Danfo Driver fame and Seriki, were recently spotted in the Sangotedo area of Ajah. The music acts were spotted at Egbuaba Ezennaya’s newly opened lounge, Mega Lounge, and Bar. Mountain Black and Seriki were joined by Spyz and other music acts that thrilled guests at the official opening of the lounge recently. Speaking at the event, Ezennaya expressed delight saying he was glad the celebs came through for him.  The upwardly mobile businessman said the lounge which was formerly located at Ikeja was recently relocated to the island. “They are some young upcoming artists, dancers, and comedians who have been coming and they have been meeting people. A lot of serious plans for them are in place and also my target is to achieve our goal by making Mega Lounge and Bar bigger and so it will be known not only in Lagos but then the world,” Ezennaya said of his plans for the lounge.
