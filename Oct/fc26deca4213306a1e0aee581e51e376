 Queen Blessing Itua, the lead actress of a human trafficking-themed film, ‘Mrs Adams,’ recently paid a visit to the Dongo community in Ibeju Lekki, Lagos through her humanitarian organisations. The visit, Itua noted, is part of efforts at getting palliatives to the most remote area of Nigeria through her humanitarian organisations, Global Empowerment Movement (GEM) USA, and Blessings of Africa (BOA) Empowerment Foundation. The visit saw Itua’s team led by Nollywood director, Paul Julius Obomokhai, putting smiles on the faces of the indigent people of the Dongo community. Also in attendance were Nollywood stars and other personalities including Cynthia Agholor, Chris Ubani Roberts, Tonymike Edozie, Odiagbe Marcel, Nelson Nwaizim, Ifeanyi Edozie Ogechi, Ifunanya James, Idris Adisa, Desmond Julius Oshiobughie, and Chief Nurudeen Adisa. Speaking on the gesture, Obomokhai said “as the founder of the NGO, her Queen Itua’s passion is to take Motherland Africa to the next level especially the poor, needy and vulnerable of the society especially women and children. “The people of Dongo community received the palliatives with gratitude and prayers for Dr. Itua who remembered them even when hope seems lost after the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic across the world.”
