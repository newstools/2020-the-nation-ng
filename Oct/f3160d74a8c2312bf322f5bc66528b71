The National Peace Committee (NPC) has congratulated the people of Ondo State for the way and manner they comported themselves during last Saturday’s governorship election. This was even as it urged participants in the election to remain calm over the outcome of the election. Chairman of the NPC and former Head of State Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar in a statement in Abuja, said: “We urge all participants in the election to remain calm over the outcome of the election with respect to the letter and spirit of the peace accord that was signed in the state. We pray that Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu will repay the amiable people of Ondo State with the ingredients of good governance, justice and equity. Once, again, accept our congratulations and may God guide you.” The NPC congratulated the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu and his team for conducting a successful poll.
