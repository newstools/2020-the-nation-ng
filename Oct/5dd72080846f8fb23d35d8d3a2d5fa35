 UEFA is ready to confirm end of season tournaments to find the winners of its three European competitions. The success of July’s ‘one-off’ knockout tournaments, with Champions League quarter-final stages onwards played in Portugal, and Europa League in Germany has prompted UEFA’s way forward. The organisation’s President Aleksander Ceferin suggested that a ‘final four’ concept, with the semis and finals played out in a series of one-off ties, was the most likely option. However, any format alterations will be on hold until the end of the next three-year TV contract cycle in 2024.
