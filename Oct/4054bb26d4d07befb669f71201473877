The youth wing of the All Progressives Congress, (APC), the APC National Awareness for the Youths Vanguard (APCNAYV), has impressed on the leadership of the various security agencies the need to employ a strict approach to the fight insurgency in the country. The group, in a statement on Friday by its National Coordinator, Alhaji Mukhtar Abubakar in the wake of recent attacks on Borno State governor, Professor Babagana Zulum, by gunmen suspected to be members of the Boko Haram. Gunmen believed to be members of the Boko Haram sect had last month attacked Zulum and his convoy while on his way to a location within the Lake Chad area of the state. Abubakar in the statement said the call became pertinent in view of the fact that the ceaseless attacks on Zulum who is the chief security officer of the state signposts ineffectiveness in the current approach, which in the view of the group needs serious appraisal. The group in the statement however lauded Governor Zulum, whom it praised for displaying what it termed ‘uncommon courage and determination’ in his efforts to rid the state of militant insurgency. “Without any reservation, we wholeheartedly condemn the recent dastardly attack on His Excellency, Professor Babagana Zulum and his convoy,” wrote just as he expressed the group’s regrets that some military personnel as well as members of vigilance group, the Civilian JTF lost their lives during the latest ambush last month. While lamenting the fact that the spate of militant insurgency has dragged on for so long, Abubakar on behalf of the group called for a new approach to the fight by relevant security agencies in the country, saying the country has lost so many innocent souls. “Whilst we utterly condemn the attack, we call on the leadership of the security forces to tighten their grip on the area, bearing in mind this is the second deadly attack on the governor of Borno State who is single-handedly committed to restoring peace law an order in the State,” Abubakar wrote. The APC chieftain also commended the gallantry of the security personnel who repelled the terrorist attack.
