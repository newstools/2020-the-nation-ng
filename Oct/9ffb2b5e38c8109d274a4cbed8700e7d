Coach Solomon Yola of Kano Pillars and Bala Usman of Safety Shooters have vowed that their teams will retain the Prudent Energy Handball League (PEHL) title they won last season.  The league, which will begin on Saturday October 31 at the MKO Abiola Stadium (Package B). Yola said it is easier to get to the top but maintaining the position is always tough. He said his team is aware of the task ahead and ready to do well and retain their title. He said: “We want to do everything possible to retain our title. We have all the players that won the title and we have promoted players from our junior to the first team.  So, we are strong and good to go. While admitting that the lock down caused by the Covid-19 affected his team, he is, however, sure that his players are back to their best. Usman, whose female team are the defending champions, said that his team started preparation early despite Coronavirus pandemic. “As usual, we started our preparation as early as we could considering the constraint of the covid-19 and we adhered to our training programmes judiciously. The players responded well to training despite being rusty. We are hoping to win the title, just like every other team. Every team wants to beat my female team and we are equally doing our best to retain the title. “It wasn’t easy when we reassembled for training. It was painful initially but I am happy with the level we have attained. I must commend my players for their commitment and the management for ensuring that we get to this level,” Usman added.
