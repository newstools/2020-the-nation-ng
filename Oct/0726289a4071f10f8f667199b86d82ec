Gunmen have killed an unidentified couple in Afikpo North Local Government Area of Ebonyi. The bodies of the couple, who hail from Amuzu Nkpogoro Community in Afikpo North LGA, were discovered by youths at their farmland. A source from the area said the couple went to the farm on Thursday but did not return to their home by nightfall. This prompted youths to raise a search party for them, which led to the discovery of their bodies on Friday morning “This morning their dead bodies were found, packed together in farmland and the people promptly reported the matter to the police who have commenced an investigation. “The youths of the area who went in search of the couple are now at the Police Division, Afikpo North waiting for the DPO,” the source noted. Police Commissioner, Philip Maku, confirmed the incident. “We have an incident where a man and his wife went to the farm but could not return. We are investigating to find out who did the act. Anybody with useful information on the perpetrators should contact the police,” he said.
