Tottenham have reached an agreement with Benfica to sign Brazilian striker Carlos Vinicius on loan. The agreement – confirmed by the Portuguese club on Thursday – includes a £2.7m loan fee with an option to buy for a further £38.2m. Vinicius, who joined Benfica from Napoli for £15m last summer and is seen as a capable back-up to Spurs striker Harry Kane, is expected to fly to London for his medical on Friday. The 25-year-old scored 24 goals last season and was linked with a host of Europe’s biggest clubs – including Juventus and Inter Milan. Jose Mourinho was asked about the deal after Tottenham’s win over Maccabi Haifa in Europa League qualifying, but said: “No, I want you to ask me that question when it’s confirmed. “Nobody told me it’s done so I’m going to respect the situation, respect the player, respect Benfica and wait a little bit more. Next time we see each other maybe I’m in conditions to answer.” Vinicius has made two appearances this campaign, in the Champions League defeat by PAOK and the 5-1 win over Famalicao earlier in September. Mourinho said on Wednesday he was optimistic of signing a striker before the transfer deadline closes on October 5. “I am optimistic, but more than that the feeling that I like is that we are trying everything to do it,” he said. “You succeed or you don’t succeed. It’s like a football match: you win or you don’t win but you give everything and try everything. The transfer market is the same. “I like the feeling that my club is trying to do everything for us and for the team, that’s the most important thing for me. “If we succeed then great – I believe so – but if we don’t then that’s football.” Mourinho added that any new arrival this week would be unlikely to face Manchester United in the Premier League on Sunday.
