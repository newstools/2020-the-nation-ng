NATIONAL President of Parent Teacher Association (PTA) Haruna Danjuma has called on Federal and state governments to provide adequate security to schools, to protect teachers and students from kidnappers and ensure adherence to COVID-19 protocols. Danjuma spoke in an interview with reporters in Kaduna yesterday.  He said the increasing security challenges in the country makes it imperative to make provision of adequate security personnel in schools a priority. The PTA President noted that schools in rural areas should be given priority as most attacks by bandits were perpetrated at rural communities. Danjuma also said schools must adhere to COVID-19 protocols as students resume, to avoid the second wave of coronavirus attack.  He appealed to traditional and religious leaders, non-governmental organisations and other stakeholders to monitor schools and initiative ways to protect students and teachers in their communities. Danjuma said the PTA would collaborate with the police, civil defence corps, vigilantes and other security services to ensure security of schools nationwide. “We must support the education of our children and we must join hands toward making them have enabling environment for their studies,” he said. Danjuna noted that the six months closure of schools due to coronavirus pandemic has caused a serious setback to the educational sector, especially young children in rural areas. He, therefore, said teachers must commit themselves in leveraging the situation through incisive teaching and revision to make up for the time lost due to COVID-19.
