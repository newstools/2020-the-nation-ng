 THE five local government areas of Oron, Mbo Udong Uko, Urue Offong, Oruko and Okobo have sued the Akwa Ibom State government for not listing them among oil producing communities. The matter instituted by the five council areas known as ‘Oro Nation, is before the Federal High Court sitting in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State. The local governments said they are worried that they have not been gazetted by the government and conferred with the status of an oil producing area eight years after the National Assembly passed a resolution on the matter. The suit with no FHC/ABJ/215/2020 is filed by Dr. Celsius Ukpong and two others on behalf of the Oro people applicants, while the Akwa Ibom State Government and the Federal Government as well as the Attorney-General of the Federation are listed as fourth, fifth and sixth respondents. The applicants are seeking the relief of court for a declaration that Oro people are entitled to enjoy the same rights as other oil bearing communities in the state. When the case was mentioned for hearing, Justice A. A. Okeke adjourned the matter till November 28 for further mention on the grounds that the additional affidavit filed by the applicant’s counsel for leave of court to be used was not served to all parties involved.
