 LAYCON, Dorathy, and 15 other housemates were recently presented with their winnings from Guinness sponsored tasks during their days inside the BBNaija house. Guinness Nigeria, the Gold sponsor of the 2020 Big Brother Naija show, hosted the winner of the show, Laycon, and other housemates for the prize presentation. The beverage alcohol company officially awarded a cash prize of N1 million to Team Hops (Praise, Dorathy, Ozo, Neo, Wathoni, Tolanibaj, Prince, and Nengi) for the Guinness Smooth Tribe photography challenge and N2 million to Team Barley (Kiddwaya, Brighto, TrickyTee, Lucy, Erica, Vee, Kaisha, and Laycon) for the Guinness Smooth Hunt task. Team Barley also won a share of N1 million from Guinness as The Voters Choice Winner for the #SmoothChallenge. An all-expense-paid trip and a sum of N1 million was awarded to each team member of Team Gold Label (Laycon, Nengi, Vee) for winning the Johnnie Walker Wager. The overall BBNaija winner, Olamilekan ‘Laycon’ Agbeleshe, and the first runner-up, Dorathy Bachor, were rewarded with a trip to Dublin, Ireland, to witness the greatness of Guinness. Speaking at the presentation, the Marketing Director, Guinness Nigeria, Adenike Adebola said, “The Big Brother Naija lockdown season was another fitting opportunity to further fulfill a purpose while also gifting viewers a sense of communion through our exciting initiatives on the show. Likewise, the BBN participants all became brand advocates through our well-curated activations; driving relevant branded conversations and making our brands the most talked about across the respective categories. The House of Guinness is proud of all the winning teams from each experience. We are excited to reward them tonight and we look forward to watching them unravel our illustrious history in different capacities, as they take another step on their journey to greatness.”
