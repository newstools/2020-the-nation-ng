 The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) in Anambra State has arrested 44 suspected illicit drugs dealers in the state. The Commander of the Agency, Mohammed Idris who disclosed this in a chat with newsmen, said four of the suspects were females. He said 19 of them were found guilty after investigations and would be prosecuted, adding that the rest were referred to rehabilitation center for counseling.  He said, “The agency confiscated about two tonnes of illicit drugs, consisting of 1720kg of canabis sativa, 0.210 crystalline methamphetamine, 5,000 tablets of tramadol, about 10,481 tablets of Diazepam, 2.1 liters of cough syrup with codine, among others.” Regretting the challenges the agency had in arraigning suspects occasioned by Covid-19 pandemic, Idris disclosed that the agency secured 11 convictions from the previous arrest. “The operations of the agency were restricted to specialised operations by the Covid-19 pandemic during the period under review,” he added.
