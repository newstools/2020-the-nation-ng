Former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode and his estranged wife, Precious Chikwendu, have been caught engaged in serious altercation on video. The couple has been reportedly separated over unresolved issues despite having four kids, including a triplet. In the 21-second video exclusively obtained by Sahara Reporters, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain was heard accusing of Precious Chikwendu of always fomenting trouble.  “Everybody wants peace but no for you it must be insults and abuses. What’s your problem for God’s sake,” he fired at her. She responded the former Minister was to blame, saying “you have been abusing me since and I said no word to you. Leave me alone.” Fani-Kayode resorted “who the hell are you? Come on, come and carry this thing.”
