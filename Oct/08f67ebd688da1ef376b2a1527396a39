 MANY Nigerians have abandoned the use of face masks, and other protocols developed by the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 to contain the virus, Network for Civil Societies on Water and Sanitation (NEWSAN) has said. The organisation, which warned that the virus was still potent and dangerous, noted that there was need for more collaboration to defeat the pandemic. Project Manager, NEWSAN, Dr. Andrew Agboro, disclosed this at the launch of the USAID E-WASH CSO COVID-19 prevention campaign organised by the Widows and Orphans Empowerment Organisation (WEWE) on Tuesday. He said: “People are no longer complying with the COVID-19 protocols. We need collaboration to defeat this virus. “Here in Delta State people know that COVID-19 is real, people know that washing of hands can prevent the disease, but they are no longer complying. “The virus took us unaware as people were not prepared for the outbreak of the virus. “I also had some doubts until I contracted the virus. COVID-19 is real. We need to join hands and obey the rules by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). The National Almirah, Federation of Muslim Women Association (FOMWAN), Halima Jibril, said many people at community levels were yet to abide by measures put in place to contain the virus. She said there was need to increase awareness level now that the virus has entered community transmission. She said FOMWAN reached out to three million people across the country during the pandemic with palliatives. “Communities are still skeptical about the evidence of COVID-19 so they do nothing about prevention like washing hands and wearing face masks. “Now that there is an increase in community transmission, we need more engagements and collaboration to increase sensitisation. “FOMWAN emphasises on hand washing as a preventive measures,” she added.
