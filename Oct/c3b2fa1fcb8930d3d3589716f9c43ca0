 AS part of  activities  to celebrate  Nigeria’s  60th   Independence anniversary, the Federal Government  has concluded  arrangements  to recognize  60 sports icons  that have won laurels  for the country in the last six decades. According to a statement by the Minister of Youth and Sports Development Sunday Dare, the decision to honour the 60 icons is in line with the dictum of one line of our national anthem that the labour of our heroes shall never be in vain:”The last 60 years has seen remarkable attainment in Sports by great sports men and women. These individuals and teams brought glory and honour to our fatherland. “They therefore need to be symbolically honoured as a mark of appreciation for their selfless service. By this recognition, the athletes will feel fulfilled and the younger generation would get motivated to emulate them.” The voting process through various platforms would end on October 8th , while a committee would pick the final 60 sports icons from the pool while  the event would kick off on October 16th  at the Velodrome of the Moshood Abiola National Stadium Abuja where pictures of the selected icons would be on display for 60 days.
