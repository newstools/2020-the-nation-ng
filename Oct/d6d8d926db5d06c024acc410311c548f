  HAVE you ever heard the name Aisha Askira before? What about Bashir Jamoh? Â Well, let me explain: Jamoh is the Director-General of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA). For most people, the agency is all about maritime safety. But, no! It has a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) project called NIMASA e-library. That is where Askira comes in. She is the super librarian in charge of this project, which, for me, is a hidden treasure. If you need materials on cabotage, business and economy, management and oil and gas, then head to this library. All you need to access it is just registration and this vast pool of knowledge is thrown open to you. One more thing: The library has e-books duly licensed by the authors and academic journals.
