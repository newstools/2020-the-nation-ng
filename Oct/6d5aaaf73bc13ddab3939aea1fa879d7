Plateau State Governor Simon Lalong on Thursday confirmed the arrest of suspected killers of a traditional ruler in Foron District of  Barkin Ladi council area of the state. Also apprehended were suspects in the killing of an official of Department of State Services (DSS) in Shendam, and five other persons in Vwang District of Jos South Local Government Area. The governor was speaking at a meeting with community leaders to commemorate Nigeria’s 60th Independence Day held at Government House Rayfield, Jos. He said his administration is committed to protecting life and property in the state. “We won’t fold our arms and allow some unscrupulous elements to truncate the peace in Plateau. We have drawn the battle line with criminals and, together with security agencies, remain steadfast in securing our state. “When we came on board, we came with a pre-conceived mindset to end the violence and break the conflict trap. “It was against this background that we established the Plateau Peace Building Agency as well as took several other steps to arrest the vicious cycle of violence that militated against the socio-economic development of our people.”
