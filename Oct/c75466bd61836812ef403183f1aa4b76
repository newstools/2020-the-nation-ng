After the distractions of the transfer window which saw Jamilu Collins losing his place in both the Super Eagles and his German team, Paderborn, the left-back can now smile again after he featured in his second successive game of the season on Sunday in their 1-1 away draw with Sandhausen. Collins played all Paderbornâ€™s 34 games in the 2nd Bundesliga in 2018-19 as they gained promotion back to the topflight and he was involved in 30 of the 34 games that they played in their sole season in the German Bundesliga last season. But allegedly because he has had his head turned by transfer speculation Jamilu was not used in Paderborn opening three games in the 2nd Bundesliga as his place was taken by Uwe Huenemeier against FC Heidenheim while Chima Okoroji was preferred ahead of him for the games with Hamburg and Holstein Kiel. But he is now back in the good books of Paderborn head coach, Steffen Baumgart, and played against Hannover 96 on October 18 where they recorded their first victory of the season and the battling away draw at Sandhausen last Sunday.
