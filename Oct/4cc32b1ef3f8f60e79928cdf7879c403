 Lagos was recently agog with dance, music, comedy, poetry, and art exhibitions as creatives took over the city during the art exhibition program tagged, D’Gathering. ‘D’Gathering: The Independence Edition,’ organisers say it is to showcase, celebrate, and connect young people of passion and creativity. According to the convener, Adeojo Oluwaseun the mission is to network and connect young people of art, passion, and creativity because we believe that if the youth have a platform where they are free to express themselves in their own chosen way of life then the Nation is going to be better placed. While speaking on this year’s theme, Oluwaseun who is the CEO of Desoji Arts said is to celebrate Nigeria at 60.  “This is the second edition of our art exhibitions. This year, we are identifying with Nigeria @ 60 by having 60 artworks on display among other features to celebrate with our beloved country,” the visual artist said. On his passion for art, he said, “Growing up, art has always been part of me. Even while I was in school to study Law at the Houdegbe North America University Republic of Benin, I managed to develop my craft in art and it has been a journey that I have no regret. “A musician has to sing. A comedian has to crack jokes, art is my way of expressing myself. Without moving an inch I can travel all over the universe. It has opened my imagination as you can reach out to the general yet unborn and you can also speak to the future and remind people of what has passed. Art is a way of life.” He, however, urged the youth to make things happen themselves rather than waiting for the government: “Youth should wake up and make things happen rather than wait for things to happen.” The art exhibition has over 60 artworks of paintings, graphic illustrations, hyper-realistic drawings, and collage from young artists across the states.
