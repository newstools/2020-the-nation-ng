 THE Kano State government has entered into partnership with Nigerian-born former England international football player, John Fashanu, in sports promotion and development. Fashanu, who described Kano as an “amazing home of football stars,” visited the State at the weekend. Speaking with the Kano State Deputy Governor Nasiru Yusuf Gawuna in his office, the football legend said he was in Kano to discuss plans for setting up a comprehensive sports academy in partnership with the state government. Fashanu said Kano, which prides itself on many soccer clubs including Kano Pillars FC, is blessed with abundant talents that if nurtured properly would become great stars in the future. “I have come to collaborate with Kano State in promoting sports, by selecting young players who will play professional football in Europe. European clubs are now craving for players from Northern Nigeria, particularly Kano state, because of their skills and talent. I am taking 13 players from Kano to get them the opportunity to play in Europe.
