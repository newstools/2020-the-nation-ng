Have you ever imagined a flourishing land of plenty, laced with richness and wealth inherent in natural resources? This is further epitomised by the cultural diversities and beauty of tradition of various states; a land flowing with milk and honey, manned by giants, languishing in lack, terrorism, corruption, political jingoism, and social vices. In time past, the land suffered the humiliation of colonisation of the British government which informed the search for individual and general liberation. Thanks to civilisation, men and women rose to spearhead self-governance through the establishment of national political parties. But, many years after Independence, we are bogged down by unnecessary policies, laws, and some archaic traditions. Despite the enormity of the economic challenges still facing many Nigerians today, optimism is keeping many alive to believe that the nation will still achieve greatness. This can only be when the youths are empowered through discipline and committed leadership, innovations, education, entrepreneurship, gender equity, and equal allocation of resources culminating in financial freedom and general peace of the country. If Nigeria will become great again, we must resolve to fight corruption and ensure good governance for the benefit of all. Also, the good old values of the fear of God, love, and respect for our neighbours and towards public facilities must be instilled in the younger generation. The new media and technological advancement must be used for positive ends. This brings me to pray: Oh God of creation, direct our noble cause Guide our leaderâ€™s right Help our youth the truth to know In love and honesty to grow And living just and true Great lofty heights attain To build a nation where peace and justice shall reign.
