 SUSPECTED pirates on Saturday reportedly shot two and injured many commuters on Calabar-Oron waterways. A source said the victims who were shot in the stomach were in critical condition and receiving treatment in the Cross River State capital. It was gathered that the suspected pirates opened fire on their victims, stealing their belongings, including cash. The source decried incessant attacks on travellers along the waterways which had witnessed serious traffic in recent times, following the deplorable condition of the Calabar-Itu highway. “A lot of travellers now prefer to use the Calabar Oron waterways because of the poor condition of Calabar-Itu highway, so we have been having series of attacks by pirates. Police spokesman  Odiko Macdon said he had no information on the incident at press time.
