 An Ado-Ekiti Chief Magistratesâ€™ Court has remanded three men for allegedly exhuming 10 corpses and beheaded their heads for rituals. The defendants Abimbola Fatoye (35); Kola Fatoye (40) and Ahmed Ojo (56) were arraigned before Chief Magistrate, Mrs Adefumike Anoma, on charge bordering on exhumation of corpses.

She alleged the defendants dug up graves and severed heads of corpses at St.Paul Anglican Church Cemetery in Orun-Ekiti . Ikebuilo said names of the severed corpses are late pa Philip Akintayo; late Madam Moreani Ajayi and eight other corpses and using same for ritual (criminal charms), which was found in the possession of the defendants without reasonable excuse.  According to her, the offences contravened and are punishable under section 242(1) b, 210 (e) and 213(b) of the Criminal Code, Laws of Ekiti State, 2012. The prosecutor urged the court to remand the defendants in the Ado Ekiti Correctional Centre pending legal advice from the office of Director of Public Prosecution (DPP).
