  MICRO and Takaful Insurance contribute less than one per cent of the premium generated in the industry, the Head, Takaful Insurance, National Insurance Commission (NAICOM), Mr Zubairu Darazo, has said. Darazo, who made this known at a lecture entitled: “Insurance development in Nigeria: The financial inclusion option’, said  takaful and micro insurance would take care of the insurance needs of low-income earners. He stated that lack of understanding of the model of the insurance among insurance firms was a bane for the low penetration. He said the commission is making progress, as it has registered about four takaful and micro insurance firms each and would register more when necessary. He said: “The registration was to achieve the 40 per cent financial inclusion target in the insurance industry. As at December 2019, the premium paid for takaful insurance stood at just N2 billion while the micro insurance was N350 million. Claims paid under the takaful insurance stood at for the N540 million while that of micro insurance was N75 million. However, the commission has planned programmes to promote these categories of insurance. “If you compare the market share of takaful and micro insurance and the premium generation for the industry, it is still less than one per cent. We have a lot of potentials in these insurance,’’ he added. He listed the registered takaful insurance firms to include Cornerstone, Salam Takaful Insurance Limited, Noor Takaful Nigeria and Jaiz Takaful Plc. Takaful entails members of a group based on mutual agreement, contributing money into a pool of funds to be utilised in  guaranteeing members against loss or damage.
