Renowned cleric, Rev Uma Ukpai, has said those agitating for actualisation of Biafra are ‘mad people’. Speaking to reporters in Uyo, headquarters of his ministry, the Abia-born cleric condemned agitations for Biafra by the Movement for the Actualisation of Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) and the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). He maintained anyone agitating for Biafra only confirms the level of his or her madness, adding however that everybody is mad, the difference only being in the level of madness. “There will always be crazy people, even when people are seen to be normal. Whoever is agitating for Biafra shows the level of his madness, but everybody is mad, the difference is the level of your madness,” he said. The Cleric, who assessed Nigeria at 60, said he is disappointed there are still divisive elements holding the country apart. According to him until Nigerians begin to love and respect another, it would not make any meaningful progress. “In Nigeria we are all in a hurry to reach where are going to, so much so that we have no regards for others, no time for others and no love for others. “As a nation until we love one another, we cannot notice one another, only when we love that which we have, that we can develop. But in Nigeria, we don’t care whether others eat or not.If we have no respect for one another, it also mean we don’t care whether others exist or not,” the cleric lamented. Reacting to clamour for restructuring by General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) and the controversies it generated, Ukpai said: “I don’t think that he (Adeboye) is not entitled to his opinion. “He is a man of God and he must have seen what happened during the civil war, which would guide him in the deductions he made. But to me, everybody is entitled to his opinion.”
