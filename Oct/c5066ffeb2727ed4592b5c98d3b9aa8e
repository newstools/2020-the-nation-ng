#EndSARS protestors on Sunday raised over N3 million for a young lady, Jane Obiene, who marched out with one limb, to join them in Abuja. Obiene reportedly joined hundreds of Abuja #EndSARS protesters bearing crutches. A photo of Obiene marching was shared on Twitter by Jonathan Odoba, a user who described her as his “heroine.” “My hero for today was this lady. She walked all through the protest #Endsars,” his tweet which gained over 18,000 likes and 16,000 retweets reads. Another twitter user, @Aproko_Doctor reshared the image and called on people to donate to buy Obiene a prosthetic leg. “This is Jane. She’s been unemployed since 2013 partly because of her disability, she came out in the #EndSARS protests and we need to help. “Please click the link below to donate to this, if you can’t donate, please RT, someone might see it on your TL,” Aproko Doctor tweeted. The Nation gathered that over 360 people have donated over N3 million and counting as at the time of this report.
