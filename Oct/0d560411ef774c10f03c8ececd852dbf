 SUPER Falcons captain, Asisat Oshoala was a 72th substitute in Barcelona’s 4-0 thrashing of Real Madrid in El Clásico of the Primera Iberdrola. Oshoala who has been described as one of the top players to watch out for in the league was a second half substitute when she replaced  Jenni Hermoso in the 72nd minutes with Barcelona kicking off the league with a comfortable win over Real Madrid who made their debut in the league. According to FIFA, Oshoala has been tagged as one of the fastest and fine finishers in the league. “Though her (Oshoala) partners in Barcelona’s three-pronged attack, Hermoso and Hansen, usually attract most of the attention, it is hard to find a player in the whole Liga who can match the Nigerian for pace and finishing prowess. Could this be her year?” FIFA wrote on its website. The Nigerian made a tremendous contribution to Barcelona league triumph last season netting 20 goals from 19 appearances in the league. In yesterday’s tie, Real Madrid Women were unable to get off to a winning start in their first ever official match with Barcelona claiming victory in El Clásico of the Primera Iberdrola, after dominating possession from the start of the encounter at the Real Madrid City. The visitors created the first chance in the 13th minute, but Misa kept out Graham’s powerful shot from inside the box. Barcelona took the lead in the 18th minute when Patri scored from outside the area. After going a goal behind, Real Madrid applied the pressure and produced their best spell of the game. Kaci tested Paños in the 23rd minute and Asllani found the net in the 29th minute for David Aznar’s side, but the goal was ruled out by the match official.
