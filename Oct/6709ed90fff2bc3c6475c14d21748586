Manchester City forward Raheem Sterling is reportedly  planning to launch a foundation aimed at helping disadvantaged young people. The 25-year-old said he wanted to create something “humongous” for the people he was helping with the organisation which would focus on social mobility. The England international’s charitable body would help those supported by Marcus Rashford, who plays for his club’s rivals Manchester United, and his food poverty activism. Sterling said: “That’s me finished with the ‘what can happen, what should happen’. Now I’m trying to put into place stuff I can do myself. “Stuff to give young people in the same circumstances I was in another shot. If there is a university they want to go to, football equipment they need, other things … I want to be a helping hand.”  It is reported that Sterling was still working on the finer details of the foundation, but that his contribution was likely to be seven figures. It added he has asked his club and his main sponsors to match his contribution, meaning the fund could top £10 million.
