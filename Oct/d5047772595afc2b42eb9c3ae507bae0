Rivers Governor, Nyesom Wike, has banned all forms of protests, including the #EndSARS campaign in any part of the state. Some groups had mobilised youths to begin a protest against the disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad in Port, Harcourt, the state capital, on Tuesday. But Wike, in a statement by the Commissioner for Information and Communications, Paulinus Nsirim, insisted there was no need for such protest since the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu, had proscribed the notorious police outfit. The Governor advised parents and guardians to ensure their children comply with his directive against such protest. The statement said: “The Rivers State Government hereby wishes to inform the general public that all forms of protests have been banned throughout the State. “Therefore, all proposed protests under #End SARS  Campaign are hereby prohibited. Government took this decision because the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, had already scrapped the Special Anti-Robbery Squad. “Therefore, there is no need for any form of protest against a Unit of the Police Force that no longer exists. Parents and Guardians are therefore advised to ensure that their children or wards do not violate this order. Law enforcement agencies are also directed to ensure that the ban is enforced and that violators are brought to book”.
