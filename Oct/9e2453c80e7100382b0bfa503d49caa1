 NIGERIA international striker  Victor Osimhen  has been given  a clean bill of health  after Napoli officially announced that the team members have all tested negative for coronavirus. The Partenopei prepare for a tough match against Atalanta in Serie A on Saturday and after having been blocked from travelling to Turin at the start of the month, Napoli have carried out regular tests ever since. A statement from the club reads: “The swabs of the squad members from yesterday morning have all come back negative for COVID-19.” Gennaro Gattuso’s men were forced to sit out of the match against Juventus by the local health authority and the outcome of the Juventus-Napoli case is expected this week. Meanwhile, the sports judge has taken his time before making a decision on the outcome of Juventus-Napoli, and the verdict is expected today. The match originally scheduled for Sunday October 4 at the Allianz Stadium was never played, but the Old Lady turned up, despite knowing that Napoli couldn’t travel on the day. Juventus asked for a win by default, whilst Napoli wanted to postpone the fixture to a later date. The Partenopei were accused of breaking the protocol and an hypothesis of a one point deduction even in the case of postponing of the match emerged in Italian media.
