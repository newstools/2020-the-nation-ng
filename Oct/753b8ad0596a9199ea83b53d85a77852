Family of the 20-year-old Daniel Ikeaguchi, aka Sleek, who was murdered by a policeman in Elelenwo, Rivers State, has dragged the Nigeria Police Force to the high court sitting in Port Harcourt, demanding N1bn damages. The family’s lawyer, Noble Njoku, said he filed the suit on October 16th 2020, challenging the violation of the fundamental human rights of the deceased by the police. He said the suit sought, among others: “A declaration that the killing of Daniel Ikeagwuchi Onyeukwu on the 19th of September 2020 at Elelenwo in Obio/Akpor Local Government Area, Rivers State, by the Nigeria Police is unjustified and unlawful.” He said the suit also asked the court to declare that the continuous refusal of the Nigeria Police to arraign and prosecute the alleged culprits contravened the deceased right to fair hearing. Njoku said the suit asked the court to make an order awarding N1bn to the family of late Ikeaguchi as damages for the unlawful killing, saying hearing for the matter would begin on November 10, 2020. Four police officers from the anti-kidnapping unit and the alleged trigger-happy policeman, identified as Sergeant Ben Isiah, underwent orderly room trial at the State Criminal and Investigation Department (SCID).
