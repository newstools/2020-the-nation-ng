 Candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the October 10 governorship election Eyitayo Jegede has promised to sanitise the education sector if elected as governor. He said he has assured parents that the exorbitant tuition fees will be reversed. The PDP standard-bearer spoke at Daada community in Akure North Local Government after the community leaders complained about the state of public schools. Chief Patrick Ojo, who spoke on behalf of the community, said there were only two teachers at Daada Community Primary School. He said: “This is the situation in most rural communities of Ondo State where the current government only assigned two teachers to a school. “In the first place, there is no way the two teachers can cope with the stress of the job. “Again, no human being is an encyclopaedia, such that he has the capacity to know every subject. “So it is best imagined, what we, the rural dwellers of Ondo State, are going through. “As you can see sir, we don’t have a good road. “You can rest assured of our votes, but please put our requests in mind.” Jegede said it was absurd for two teachers to be posted to a school. “We will improve schools’ infrastructure and ensure quality education. “As for the bad road, it is a priority that it should be fixed, as it will ease the movement of produce to the urban communities.”
