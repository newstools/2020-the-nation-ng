 Super Eagles technical crew will not name a new replacement for injured Oghenekaro Etebo ahead of the upcoming friendly games against Algeria on Friday and Tunisia next week Tuesday in Austria. It was reported by the NFF on Twitter that the newly signed Galatasaray midfielder won’t be available for the Eagles friendlies citing injury despite playing the entire duration of the game for his club in their 1-0 loss to Kasimpasa on Sunday in a Turkish Super Lig tie. The media Officer of the Super Eagles, Toyin Ibitoye who left with technical crew members and other officials as advance party to Austria on Sunday explained that coach Gernot Rohr has hinted that he would work with the remaining invited players.  “No, no fresh call up will be extended to anybody because the time is too short. The technical crew is aware Etebo will not be joining and they are prepared to make do with the ones that are around. “We have some of the players that have started arriving. Everyone is ready for both games and with optimism that they will give a good account of themselves.” Both  Tyrone Ebuehi and Paul Onuachu were late replacements for hitherto invited Wilfred Ndidi and Victor Osimhen for  the two friendlies.
