 A mobile policeman was shot dead by gunmen on Sunday morning in Osubi, Okpe local government area of Delta state. The incident, which caused panic in the area, occurred around 9am. The Nation gathered the gunmen had attempted to break into a plaza along the ever busy Osubi-Abraka Road. The mobile policeman, who tried to stop them, was shot dead. Though the identity of the deceased was yet-to-be ascertained, it was learnt he was on special assignment from Kebbi. According to a witness: “A mobile police officer was shot dead this morning (Sunday) at Osubi near Effurun. “Some gunmen were trying to rob the mall when the officer was shot dead. I can’t tell if his rifle was carted away but he died on the spot. “The incident took place this morning at a shopping mall in Osubi. He was a mobile policeman from Kebbi State. He wasn’t an officer of the Delta Police Command”. Gunmen last Friday killed a mobile policeman and civilian at a police checkpoint in Eku, Ethiope East council area of the state. When reached for comments, the Delta State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Onome Onovwakpoyeya, confirmed the incident. “The incident happened this morning (Sunday), but I don’t have the fact yet.
