 Nigeria  Football Federation (NFF) has named American Randy Waldrum as the new Head Coach of the Senior Women National Team, Super Falcons. Waldrum replaces Swedish Coach Thomas Dennerby, who left his role in 2019 after taking the Super Falcons to the second round of the FIFA Women’s World Cup in France. Waldrum, an American who played as a midfielder, has worked largely within the American women football circle and was head coach of the Trinidad and Tobago national team between 2014 and 2016 and will leave his job at University of Pittsburgh women’s team for Nigeria. The 64-year-old tactician will work with former Super Falcons’ goalkeeper and Captain Ann Chiejine, who is the first Assistant Coach, while Wemimo Mathew Olanrewaju will serve as second Assistant Coach and Auwar Bashir Makwalla will be goalkeepers’ trainer. President of the Nigeria Football Federation, Amaju Pinnick thanked Philips Consulting, the executors of the recruitment process, and said he has confidence that the new technical crew will take the Super Eagles to brand new heights. “The predominance of the Super Falcons on the African continent has never been in doubt, with nine titles out of 11 editions of the Women AFCON competitions held so far. We envision a new Super Falcons squad competing favourably for laurels at the global level, and I believe the new technical crew led by Mr. Waldrum can take us to that level.”   Full name :   Randy Marlon Waldrum Date of birth: September 25, 1956 (age 64) Place of birth: Irving, Texas, United States Playing position:  Midfielder College career: Midwestern State University (1979-1981) Senior career: Los Angeles Skyhawks;Indianapolis Daredevils; New York Cosmos Teams managed: Pittsburg State University (women; 1978–1989); Tulsa (men, 1989–1994); University of Tulsa (women, 1989–1994); Baylor University (women, 1996–1998); University of Notre Dame (women, 1999–2013); Trinidad and Tobago (women, 2014–2016); Houston Dash (2014–2017); University of Pittsburgh (women, since 2018)
