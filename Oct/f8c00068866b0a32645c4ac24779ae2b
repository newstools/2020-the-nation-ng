PUTTING his 70th birthday on hold must have been a tough decision for Ibadan senior chief, Oloye ‘Lekan Alabi, considering the big plans already in place. Alabi was already looking forward to the D-Day, Tuesday, October 27, and invites had been extended to friends and associates. Social Circuit learnt that the decision to cancel the celebration was made after a family meeting where it was agreed that it would be insensitive to hold a celebration amid lives lost during the EndSARS protests. But a later date will be picked for the big celebration.  Oloye Alabi, who was promoted from Agba Akin Olubadan to Ekefa Olubadan, few months ago, is the first Culture Ambassador of the National Museum and Monument, Ile Ife. He was installed the Mogaji Oyetunji Olundegun Family of Ile Oye, SW2/486, Isale ‘Jebu, Ibadan, by the 38th Olubadan of Ibadanland, the late Oba Emmanuel Adeyemo, Operinde 1, on November 31, 1994, and was first promoted Jagun Olubadan in the Olubadan Traditional Chieftaincy Line, by the 39th Olubadan of Ibadanland, the late Oba Yunusa Bankole Oladoja Ogundipe, Arapasowu 1, on December 12, 2002.
