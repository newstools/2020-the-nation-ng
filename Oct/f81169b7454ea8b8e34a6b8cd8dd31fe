The founder of the Christ Living Apostolic Church, Oke-Iyanu, Kuole, Ibadan, Madam Eunice Bolatito Oyelade, known widely as the Greatest Grandma, has been called home to glory. Born in Inisa, Osun State, to Mr. James Babawale and Ruth Foyeke on March 3rd, 1930, she got married in 1950 to Rev Anthony Ladosu Oyelade whom she met as a co-student of St. Peter’s Anglican Church Primary School, Inisa. She was raised in the Anglican Church but moved to Apostolic Movement after marriage where her husband worshipped after conversion from Islamic faith. She served in St. Paul’s Apostolic Church with her husband who passed on in 2002. She later founded the Christ Living Apostolic Church, Oke-Iyanu, Kuole, Ibadan, which she oversaw till God called her home.
