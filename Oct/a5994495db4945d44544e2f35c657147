Ondo has suspended the 24-hour curfew imposed in the wake of the #EndSARS protests with effect from Saturday. It said the decision to lift the curfew followed consultations between Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu and security chiefs after preliminary assessment of security situation in the State. A statement by Ondo Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Donald Ojogo, explained Akeredolu, who gave approval for the lifting of the curfew, said the decision was encouraged by the relative peace in Akure, the State capital. It said: “The relative peace in the State capital, Akure appears very encouraging just as the people’s resolve, especially the youths, not to allow brigandage under any guise is equally palpable. It is, therefore, only normal that law abiding residents are allowed to go about their legitimate businesses. “Government however, emphasises the need for all to be vigilant and law-abiding. This is more so, that security agencies deployed to strategic areas of the State capital are under strict directives to enforce law and order for the enforcement of permanent peace.”
