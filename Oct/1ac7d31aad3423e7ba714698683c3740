The National Examination Council (NECO) has announced the indefinite postponement of the ongoing Senior Secondary School Certificate Examination (SSCE). The examination body’s Governing Board took the decision at its special meeting last Thursday after reviewing the conduct of the 2020 examination nationwide. In a statement, dated October 21, 2020, NECO had announced the rescheduling of some papers in the examination due to its inability to deliver examination materials to some states as a result of curfew. But rising from Thursday’s meeting, the Governing Board resolved that the 2020 SSCE be postponed indefinitely in view of the current security challenges, occasioned by the ENDSARS protests, which disrupted the smooth conduct of the examinations in some parts of the country. NECO’s Head of Information and Public Relations Division, Azeez Sani, confirmed the development in a statement on Sunday. “In making this decision, the board noted that due to these security challenges: “The Governing Board further resolved, that when normalcy returns, the Council will continue with the conduct of the examinations in all States. “While regretting any inconveniences this postponement may cause our esteemed stakeholders, the Council has however taken this decision in order to maintain the integrity and security of its examination procedures for seamless conduct of the Council’s examination,” the statement said.
