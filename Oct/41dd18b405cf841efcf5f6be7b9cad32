 NEW Arsenal signing Thomas Partey wants to help the club get “back where they belong” and win the Premier League title. Ghana midfielder Partey, 27, joined the Gunners in a £45m deal from Atletico Madrid in the transfer window. Arsenal have been champions of England 13 times, with their last title coming in 2003-04. “Everybody wants to win all the trophies that can be won. That’s my goal also,” Partey said. “It’s something that’s difficult but we’re working towards it and we’re ready. We have to go all out and try and achieve all I have said. “That’s the objective of the club and myself. We have to get back to where we belong.” Arsenal’s Thomas Partey gets two assists in a 5-1 Ghana win against Qatar. Since their last Premier League successes, the Gunners have won the FA Cup five times, including last season when they beat Chelsea 2-1 in the final in August.
