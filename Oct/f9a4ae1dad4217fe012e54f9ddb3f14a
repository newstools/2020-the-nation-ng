Africa Prudential’s interest income however increased by six per cent, driven by 19.83 per cent increase in interest income on loans and advances, and 780 per cent increase in interest income on bonds.

The company reported that it was undergoing operational challenges, consequently, all production activities were in suspension pending the resolution of the challenges. Group Chief Executive Officer, United Capital Plc, Mr. Peter Ashade, said the operating environment remained tough amid the lingering COVID-19 situation and negative macroeconomic impacts as seen in the continued depreciation of the exchange rate, consistent uptick in headline inflation rate among other macroeconomic indicators. According to him, the group’s business has not been immune to the challenges, though it has remained nimble. “We continued to implement our business growth and continuity plans premised on a solid risk assessment framework to ensure we remained focused on providing best-in-class solutions to all client segments. These contributed to the impressive growth across our businesses leading to 33 per cent growth in revenue and 26 per cent increase in both pre-tax profit and profit after tax during the nine-month period,” Ashade said. He noted that the group has started to see the fruit of the strategic decision to raise N10 billion new debt capital. The company had in the second quarter issued N10 billion Series 1 Bond under the N30 billion Medium-Term Debt Program – the first to be issued by an investment banking firm in Nigeria. It was oversubscribed by about 24 per cent. He added that going into the last quarter of the year, the group is encouraged by the increasing market confidence in its brand even in the wake of the most globally devastating pandemic of the last century. “We know the operating environment is turbulent, but we are committed to deliver superior returns to our shareholders, as we drive growth and profitability across all our businesses,” Ashade said. He pointed out that in line with the group’s  initial strategy for the 2020 business year, it shall continue to push further its market diversification and cost-optimization initiatives as well as implement phased automation of its business processes whilst upholding commitment to ensuring a significant improvement in value delivery to all stakeholders. Managing Director, Africa Prudential, Mr. Obong Idiong said while the negative economic impact of the COVID-19 continue to reflect on traditional income lines, the transition of the company from a traditional registrar business to a technology business deploying technology to transform the registrar, cooperative, e-commerce, and digital technology play could not have come at a better time. “We are confident that as the company’s new businesses continue to gather momentum, we will continue to deliver sustainable value to our investors. Among the gradual result of the transformation process is the 264 per cent year-on-year growth in digital technology consultancy income. We also grew our investment income by six per cent year-on-year through an efficient allocation of investmentible fund despite the prevailing low interest rate regime,” Idiong said. He assured that the company will continue to consolidate on its gains in the digital technology space to deliver great value and exceptional experience to clients across all its touch points. Managing Director, Chemical and Allied Products (CAP) Plc, David Wright, said CAP’s performance in 2020 has been affected by COVID-19, particularly in April and May as a result of the stringent movement restrictions which constrained production and led to supply chain disruptions. “Despite the challenging operating environment, we achieved strong revenue and volume growth of 34 per cent and 34.6 per cent respectively in the third quarter of the year. Going forward, we expect to continue to see the positive effects of our growth strategy on our sales and remain focused on managing operating costs to deliver on profit ambitions in the fourth quarter,” Wright stated.
