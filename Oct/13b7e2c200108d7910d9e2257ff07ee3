Governor Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa State has approved the appointment of 11 permanent secretaries. The governor picked the 11 out of 45 candidates who wrote qualifying examination for the position. The governor, shortly on assuming office last year, introduced examination for appointment of permanent secretaries and for promotion of civil servants from level 10 and above. The governor, while addressing the appointees in the Government House Yola on Monday, restated the commitment of his government to carry out more reforms that will improve the civil service. He said his administration has engaged external examiners for the qualifying exams into the position of the permanent secretary and subject it to a rigorous process to make it the best in the country. “These are illustrations for us to understand our intention that we have nobody to favour in this process. All of you are for us, we are for you,” he said, stressing that his government would never interfere in the examination, and urged civil servants to eschew dragging politicians into the process. “We will not stop with you, we have equally given a directive that this process should be extended to those from level 10 that are aspiring to move up. Going forward, from January you can’t be on level 10 to 12 without going through an examination from a reputable organ like the Administrative Staff College of Nigeria (ASCON),” he said, explaining that ASCON was brought in to ensure diligence and justice to all. Earlier in his remark, the state Head of Civil Service, Dr. Edgar Amos Sunday said part of the guidelines for the exam candidates must be among the senior workers from the local government areas that have vacancies. He said the governor’s directive for engagement of examination experts from ASCON has ensured the conduct of the best exams without elements of favoritism.
