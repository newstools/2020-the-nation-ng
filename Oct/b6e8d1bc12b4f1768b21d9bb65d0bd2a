Kaduna State Government has extended the 24-hour curfew earlier imposed in some communities in Chikun and Kaduna South local government areas to the entire state. The State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr. Samuel Aruwan, in another statement issued yesterday night said the measure was taken to help safeguard the communities, protect lives and property and contain criminal elements who are looting public and private assets.

According to the Commissioner, “The extension of the 24-hour curfew to all the 23 local government areas of the state is effective immediately. “KDSG will keep the situation under review and regrets the inconvenience it may cause to law-abiding citizens. “The state government wishes to appeal to all residents of the state to kindly bear with the government as it takes necessary action to maintain law and order and to protect the right of citizens to live in peace.”
