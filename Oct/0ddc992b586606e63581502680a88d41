  LAST Sunday was a blissful day for Chief Executive Officer of Lapearlnyc, Pearl Ogbule, as she dedicated her baby girl. The fashion designer became a mother in August and the baby girl was named Jasmine Kosisochukwu Crystal. After the church service, a reception party followed immediately in Lagos where guests rocked their blue “aso-ebi” and partied like never before. With the #EndSARS protest that caused huge traffic in Lagos, it was a surprise that family and friends still came out to celebrate with Ogbule. The award-winning stylist is also a policewoman who surprised many two years ago by joining the Nigerian Police Force.
