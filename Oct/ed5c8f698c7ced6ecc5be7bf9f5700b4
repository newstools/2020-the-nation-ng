 FORMER Super Eagles defender Andrew Uwe has decried the burning and looting of public and private properties in the aftermath of the crises occasioned by the #EndSARS protests. Speaking from Germany, the former Super Eagles defender condemned the widespread lootings and arsons. “The wanton destruction of government properties all over the country is uncalled for and should be condemned. If we destroy the heritage buildings in our country is that not counterproductive? I’m shocked to see the burning of BRT buses in Lagos. It is very bad because it is the people that will suffer for such destruction.”  He advised youths whose protests have been heard loud and clear to remain calm while government address their demands. “They have made their points and it is pertinent that they remain calm and embraced dialogue with government. I am not happy with what is going on in my country and for those of us that lives abroad we are very much concern. We want peace to reign in Nigeria.” Hoodlums had hijacked the #EndSARS protests against police brutality to perpetrate mayhem in the country with several attacks on prisons and freeing inmates. Several police stations, business premises as well as public and private properties have been looted and torched this week. They include Orile police station, Layeni police station, Amukoko police station, Cele outpost, Mushin police division, Ilembe Hausa police division, Lagoon Hospital and Ajeromi Ifelodun local government secretariat.
