The Southwest APC UK Caucus has congratulated Ondo State Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu on his re-election. A statement by the Secretary of the caucus, Mr. Wole Olagunju, quoted the Chairman, Mr. Kenny Ojutalayo, as congratulating Governor Akeredolu on his re-election. The statement noted that the resolve of the good people of Ondo State to vote massively to re-elect Akeredolu for another four years is a testimony of a successful first term of four years and a demonstration of their trust that the governor will deliver on his promises in his second term. The chairman said: “If there were no projects, it would have been difficult to manufacture lies to buttress non- performance. In the case of Akeredolu, he worked hard to secure his victory for a second term and made it difficult for rival parties to emerge victorious.” He said Akeredolu has transformed Ondo State to an industrial hub in the Southwest in education, economy and infrastructural development. In a similar development, Osun State APC UK Chairman Mr. Iyiola Awofidipe, two-term Osun State House of Assembly member Femi Fafiyebi and an APC UK leader, Prof.  Adebisi Adewole, in a statement congratulated Akeredolu on his well-deserved victory over his PDP counterpart Mr. Eyitayo Jegede and other contestants. They saluted the good spirit with which Akeredolu contested the election and his humility towards his rivals in his acceptance speech, when he described his re-election as a no victor, no vanquished situation, describing his opponents as having the qualities Ondo State could harness for its development.
