A seven-year-old missing boy, Fejiro Emoavworhe, has been found floating at the bank of Ohovwe river in Ekiugbo, Ughelli North local government area of Delta. This incident happened barely two weeks after a young lady in her 20s was found in a drainage wrapped in a sack with her breast, tongue and private part removed in Buluku street, Ughelli North local government area, Delta State. Emoavworhe was declared missing on Sunday, October 4 by his parent. John Emoavworhe, father of late Fejiro, who lives in Ogbeode Street, Ekiugbo-Ughelli, said he was only four- month-old in the community. His brother- in-law, he said, came to his house on the eve of Sunday with slices of fried yam, ice cream and plastic bottles of coke mineral for his children. He noted Fejiro, who was crying for ice cream outside, was called by a standby man with a white dress, promising to buy him the ice-cream. Narrating the ordeal, the father said: “While we were still searching for Fejiro, my brother in-law left the compound in hurry and when he was called upon by the family the following morning, he said he was going to church and later came to meet my family at about 7.00pm. “My wife’s younger brother told my family that he did not know anything about Fejiro’s disappearance but that he heard my neighbours saying that I used to beat my children and drive them out of home, that this time around I will find my child tired.” He said when his brother -in-law was asked to direct them to the apartment, all the occupants, who are mainly suspected ‘Yahoo boys’ escaped through the back door. Efforts to reach the Delta Commissioner of Police for comment failed but a senior police officer from ‘A’ Division Ughelli confirmed the incident. The remains of Fejiro Emoavworhe have been deposited at an undisclosed morgue in Ughelli while team of doctors is carrying out the autopsy.
