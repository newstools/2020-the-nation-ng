Sixteen governors elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) will on Wednesday be in Akure for the party’s candidate Eyitayo Jegede’s campaign. The governors, in a statement on Sunday by the Director General of the PDP Governors Forum, Cyril Maduabum, said the visit is the grand finale of the PDP governorship campaign ahead of Saturday’s election. Saying they are united for Jegede, the governors repudiated a report in Sunday’s edition of a national newspaper (not The Nation), purporting that the PDP governors were divided over the candidate. They described the report as tendentious, malicious, prejudicial, biased, conjured, procured, inciting and false. The statement said: “For the avoidance of doubt, the PDP Governors’ Forum is united, strong and primed to do its utmost to elect our candidate in the Ondo governorship election, Eyitayo Jegede, SAN, who has the experience, dynamism and programme of action to return Ondo State to its glory days. “We think the story is the handiwork of fifth columnists, who are afraid of the popularity of the PDP candidate and his likely victory, and have devised this means of creating doubts in the minds of Nigerians as a strategy for stopping the march of victory by PDP in Ondo State. “Nothing can stop the march of progress in Ondo. Indeed, Jegede’s victory is one whose time has come.” The governors said they speak with one voice, adding that attempts by anyone to sow division and discord within their ranks have failed miserably. “As a matter of fact, the PDP governors rose from a virtual meeting a few days ago with a resolve and commitment to make sure that all hands are on deck to support and deliver the PDP candidate. “They are aware of the importance of the Ondo election to the image, solidarity and fortunes of the PDP.”
