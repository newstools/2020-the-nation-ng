An Ijaw leader in Warri, Delta State, Chief Favour Izoukumor, has expressed shock and denunciation at the Wednesday’s attack on The Nation newspaper and TVC by hoodlums in Lagos. Izoukumor, who is spokesperson (Fieye-Owei) of Ogbe-Ijoh Warri Kingdom, also condemned the loss of lives, even as he sympathized with the owners of businesses that are being in ongoing carnages raging across the country. “The deaths are sad and avoidable; it is important for us to take a step back as human beings and reflect on who we are; all these hourly and daily reports of killings, arsons, looting pillaging beaming from across the country to the world.” “These actions are condemnable and totally unwarranted, especially at this critical moment in our nation when we are battling the scourge of the coronavirus and when we are staring at another economic recession. The masterminds must be revealed and allowed to have their days in court with the stiffest penalties. “It is sad to see people wreaking havoc and destruction on people’s sources of livelihood, throwing people into unemployment and taking food from the mouths of so many people under the guise of protests.”
