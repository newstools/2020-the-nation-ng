The Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun State, Prince Adegboyega Famodun, has said Governor Adegboyega Oyetola is not mobilising members to rig the party’s standard-bearer, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, into power. He said Oyetola, being a member of the APC National Caretaker Committee, identified a local government in Ondo State where they have a large number of Osun State indigenes and is canvassing votes in favour of the APC candidate. He boasted that victory awaits Akeredolu on Saturday. The APC chairman, represented by the party’s Senatorial Leader in Osun Central, Adeoye Adelakun, spoke at the weekend at a meeting with party leaders at Ada in Boripe Local Government. He said: “Governor Oyetola is not mobilising APC members from Osun State to Ondo State to rig the poll for Governor Rotimi Akeredolu. What the governor is doing is that he identified a local government, Odigbo, where most residents are Osun State indigenes. He went there to canvass votes for Akeredolu. The people complained that they are marginalised by the current government. So, he felt he should talk to them. “The reason I am here is to listen and hold a meeting with the leaders of our party here in Ada because they are also complaining that they are marginalised.”
