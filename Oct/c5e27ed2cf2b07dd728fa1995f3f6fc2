The National Examinations Council (NECO) has rescheduled some of its papers due to the current crisis across the country. In a statement issued by the Head of Information and Public Relations Division, Azeez Sani, the affected papers which were supposed to be written from Thursday 22 October 2020, Friday 23 October 2020 and Saturday 24 October 2020 are now scheduled for 17th, 18th and 19th November 2020. The Examination Body said that it was constrained by circumstances beyond its control to reschedule the papers. “These changes were due to the security challenges, which led to the imposition of curfew and closure of schools by some state governments, in order to safeguard lives and properties. ” In the circumstances, it has become difficult for the Council to move examination materials across the country. “The Council prays that the Examinations will continue on Tuesday 27 October 2020, all things being equal, with the papers as originally scheduled in the examination time table.”
