Minister of Transportation Rotimi Amaechi on Thursday met the Ambassador of Niger to Nigeria, Alat Mogaskia, over the modalities of the newly approved Kano-Maradi rail line. The federal government on Sept. 23 approved a contract for the development of the proposed Kano-Katsina-Jibia to Maradi rail line in the Niger Republic and Dutse, capital of Jigawa, at the cost of $1.96 billion U.S. dollars. At the meeting, Amaechi said that there was a need for both countries to meet over the infrastructure the Nigerian government hoped to construct in Maradi. “We are trying to build a rail up to Maradi, we want to meet the State Governor over the infrastructure where it would be located because we plan to construct rail stations and a warehouse. “Since the contract was awarded, this is the first meeting we are having to see what we really need to do to get the rail into Maradi, I plan to do a letter by Monday to the Minister of Transport in Niger to help us seek approval from the State governor or federal government to enable us to construct the rail to Maradi.” Mogaskia said that the Niger Republic gives it support on the development because it would open up the economy between both countries, stating that it’s not too late to inform the Niger government about the project. “We are really behind the development, the matter is not too late for the Nigerian government to intimate the Niger government about the project. The most important person in the parliament is from Maradi and he welcomes this idea. “On leaving this place now, we will immediately contact all the relevant bodies in Niger, they will all be sensitised about the project. “Whatever presentation we are making today will get a good reception for a quick response, so that the project can go ahead. ” He however said that the Niger government would give it support for the project to come into realisation.
