 RAMSEY Nouah is currently on a mission to repeat another feat with ‘Rattlesnake: The Ahanna Story’ after an impressive performance with ‘Living in Bondage’ remake. The popular actor has again taken on the role of the director for the highly anticipated film, ‘Rattlesnake: The Ahanna Story,’ scheduled for a November 2020 release. Speaking on his second major project as a director, Nouah said, “ I just want to say I’m very glad and very happy to be a part of this project, besides that, I want to thank every one of the cast. They made the job easy. We have quite a number of titles already laid out for 2020 and 2021 and probably even beyond.” Continuing, Nouah reiterated Play Network boss, Charles Okpaleke’s vision to remake several Nollywood classics.  “Charles Okpaleke’s vision is to do remakes of classic Nollywood stories. So with the success of ‘Living in Bondage’, he felt like we should try the others,” he said. Meanwhile, Okpaleke has hinted that the Rattlesnake remake will surpass the success story of the Living in Bondage remake. Okpaleke said, “ ‘Rattlesnake: The Ahanna Story’ will surpass the success ‘Living in Bondage’ garnered and this ride on the excellence Play Network has come to be known for.” Written by Nicola Asinugo, Rattlesnake: The Ahanna Story features Stan Nze, Osas Ighodaro, Elma Mbadiwe, Brutus Richard, Gloria Anozie Young, Norbert Young, and a host of others.
