 A non-governmental organisation, Human Development Initiatives has enjoined Nigerian government at all levels to devote more percentage of their annual budgetary allocations to education in order to increase the pace of development in the country. Speaking in Lagos at a sensitization programme for education stakeholders in Ojo Local Government Area of the state, the HDI Program Officer, Johnson Ibidapo noted that no serious government that wants meaningful development will trivialize the issue of education. He urged government to strive to do more and earmark at least 15 percent of its total annual budget to education sector even if they cannot devote 19-20 percent of total annual budget as recommended by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO). Reacting to ENDSARS protest that was hijacked by hoodlums in some parts of the country last week, Ibidapo tasks government to do more in prioritising education and reduce the army of 13 million out of school children off the streets, saying failure to do so may amount to a time ticking bomb for Nigeria. The education expert encouraged states government to also seek for alternative way of funding education in their various states, adding that education development being in the concurrent legislative list, UBE funds from federal government should not become source of basic education development to state government. “Government should do more, they are not doing enough. The situation where you are using billions of Naira to renovate National Assembly complex and you have school children whose infrastructure are comatose”
