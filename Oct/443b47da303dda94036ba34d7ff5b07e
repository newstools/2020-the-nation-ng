 OSUN State Governor Adegboyega Oyetola has said Nigeria cannot afford another crisis as the nation is still battling with the effects of COVID-19 pandemic. The governor said this is the time for the nation to properly harness its potentials for quick economic recovery rather than engaging in things that can degenerate into national disintegration and disunity. Oyetola spoke on Tuesday in Osogbo, the state capital, while hosting the state’s local government chairmen. He warned youths to be wary of being used by people with evil intentions to hijack the protest for criminal gains. “The aspect of the movement that has become worrisome is that the genuine intentions of protesting youths have been hijacked by people who have ulterior motives. Several states are beginning to have unpleasant stories to tell about the distasteful outcomes of this protest. This is rather unfortunate. “Given that we just barely survived a pandemic, we cannot afford another crisis. This is the time to invest efforts in working for the economic recovery of our states and the nation at large, not engage in violence,” Oyetola said.
