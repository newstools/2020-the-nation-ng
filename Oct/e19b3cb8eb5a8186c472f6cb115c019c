The strike called by organised labour in Kwara State began on Tuesday in Ilorin, the state capital. Civil servants defied government’s order stopping them from embarking on the industrial action. Shortly after the labour unions told the workers to begin strike yesterday, the government said it had obtained an injunction stopping the strike. Checks by our correspondent showed that government offices such as the two state secretariats, Local Government Service Commission, Civil Service Commission, Teaching Service Commission, ministries, courts, among others were shut. Public primary and secondary schools were also locked, as pupils were turned back. However, it was gathered that some people, suspected to be hired thugs, invaded some ministries and the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) state headquarters in Ilorin to unlock the offices with hard objects. NLC state Chairman Comrade Aliyu Issa-Ore expressed satisfaction about the level of compliance by the workers. He urged them not to be discouraged by alleged attacks on their leaders by suspected thugs, saying they should remain peaceful and law-abiding during and after the strike. The government had warned against embarking on the strike, reminding workers “of the provisions of public service rules.” Head of Service (HOS) Mrs. Susan Oluwole said: “This is to inform civil servants that the Akure zone of the Industrial Court has given an injunction stopping the planned strike by the state labour union. “Civil servants are, therefore, to resume normal work at their places of work in full compliance with the COVID-19 protocols as established by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) for daily schedule. “Security arrangement has been made to guarantee the safety of all. “We appeal to labour unions to continue to negotiate with the government to reach an acceptable agreement on the new minimum wage.”
