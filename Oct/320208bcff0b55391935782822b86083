Fatima, daughter of former Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) chairman, Nubu Ribadu, has begged those offended by her wedding dress for forgiveness. She got married to Aliyu, son of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar at the weekend in Abuja. Her dress generated a stir among Muslims on social media who lambasted her for exposing her body. In a statement on Tuesday, she however said the colour of the dress was the same as her skin, which she said might have made people think she exposed her body. She said: “I cannot expose my skin. My wedding dress has the same colour with that of my skin, but I still apologize to my friends and family who don’t like what happened and I hope to learn from this.”
