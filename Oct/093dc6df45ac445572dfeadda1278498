Super Eagles defender William Troost-Ekong believes he is adapting very well in the defense line of Watford after he joined the English Championship side. He has slotted seamlessly into the Hornets’ watertight defence after Watford beat Derby 1-0 at the weekend, admitting he felt a sense of pressure in helping the team to keep a fourth clean sheet in five league matches in what is the club’s best run of defensive form in 32 years. “I enjoyed it,” said the defender, who signed from Udinese on a long-term deal, speaking to Hive Live Extra. “You have to take a little while to get used to the other guys as I’ve only trained with the guys for a bit.  “There is a lot of responsibility when you come in for your first game, but I tried to adapt as quickly as possible. It’s easier with Ben [Foster] behind you talking a lot. I tried to keep myself in the game by talking, too, and I thought it [my debut] went alright. We’ve got so many games and we are going to need everybody, so competition all over the squad is important. The fear was that Wayne Rooney was going to pull something out of his repertoire to win the game but although he threatened a couple of times, including twice after Troost-Ekong had gone off, he was largely kept at arm’s-length. “Rooney was someone I watched growing up and you have to make sure you don’t give him any chances around the box,” said the 27-year-old.”
