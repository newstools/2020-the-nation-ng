Nasarawa State Government has commenced fumigating 179 secondary schools and 1,408 primary schools across the state, ahead of reopening of schools. General Manager of Nasarawa State Environmental Protection Agency (NASEPA) Mr. Iliyasu Yusuf Adeka said the exercise was part of the measures put in place by the state government to combat termites and reptiles before students and pupils resume schools after months of Coronavirus break. According to him, “The schools are expected to reopen for students after the closure of schools for some months ago due to the outbreak of Coronavirus pandemic.” He said the chemicals being applied are environmentally-friendly and not harmful to human beings and that they would also guarantee the safety of the pupils and students in the schools. He urged the principals and headmasters of the schools to give the necessary support needed to ensure a hitch-free exercise.
