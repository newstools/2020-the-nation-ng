The Port-Harcourt-based lawyer Paulette Bisola Ajayi, who was kidnapped last Sunday, has narrated her ordeals in the hands of her abductors. She said she would have been killed if not for police rescue operation. Ajayi, a 25-year-old lawyer, was violently whisked away by gun-wielding marauders dressed in military combat fatigue, on October 4 at the entrance of their apartment at Rumuokurusi area of Port Harcourt, the capital city. Ajayi, who relieved her ordeal, said she feared for her life but kept praying to God for survival because the kidnappers had concluded plans to take her to the swamp and kill her. She said the kidnappers were apprehensive at the wide publicity her abduction generated and resolved that killing her the next day was the only way to guarantee their safety. She said: “On Sunday evening I was taken by unknown men in front of my house. They shot at me and they took me before my family members. They were going to ask for a ransom of N50m. “By the next day, the ransom went up to N200m because everybody had reported that I was missing. “They were getting quite frantic and looking for how to kill me because they were certain that with the news that had gone round, somehow, something was going to go wrong. “They planned to move me into the swamp to kill me yesterday night. The police just came right in time because all I could do was to pray”. She said one of the hoodlums thought she had a charm wondering while despite the shooting, she did not sustain a bullet wound. Ajayi thanked Governor Nyesom Wike, Commissioner of Police, Joseph Mukan and Nigeria Bar Association (NBA) family for the roles they played in her rescue.
