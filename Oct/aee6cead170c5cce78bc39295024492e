 THE arrival of Victor Osimhen at Napoli has added bite to the front line of Coach Gennaro Gattuso team according to Italian news outlet, Corriere della Sera. The newspaper highlights the importance of the new addition in the Neapolitan attack following their 4-1  thrashing of Atalanta in last weekend’s Serie A match. “There are four forwards in front and they all have space, with Bakayoko doing the midfielder; this is the new formula launched by Rino Gattuso, who renounces the dribble because his team can verticalize, looks ahead and knows it’s there a tall boy (Osimhen)  with very long legs who burns opponents on time,” the paper noted. Similarly,  Gazzetta dello Sport has described the partnership of Osimhen and Lozano as impressive: “New goals and new talents, which Gattuso wanted for the realization of his technical project and who are enhancing his work despite the fact that he has only been playing for four days. “Victor Osimhen and Hirving Lozano are the news of the moment, the two of them crashed the fearsome Atalanta, limiting all intentions. “A combination of pure technique, speed and just that much physicality that doesn’t hurt to face the opposing defences. “Here are the wonders of Naples, those surprises that you don’t expect and that, instead, trigger the imagination. “ After the 4-1 trimmed on Saturday at Atalanta, in these parts the Scudetto is back again, a team capable of being able to compete until the end with Juventus, Inter and Milan for the title,” the paper added.
