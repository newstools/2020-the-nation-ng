 LAGOS State Government has empowered over 2,000 residents at the second edition of its social intervention programme called Eko Cares. The initiative, launched by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, was aimed to create a platform for financial empowerment of the poorest of the poor, thus enhancing socio-economic inclusion and cohesion. The Special Adviser, Office of Civic Engagement, Princess Aderemi Adebowale, said the governor has approved the extension of the gesture to another set of 2,000 beneficiaries in confirmation of his objectives of making Lagos a 21st century economy as espoused in the T.H.E.M.E.S agenda. She said the beneficiaries of the second phase of Eko Cares were selected across the 20 local governments and 37 local council development areas. â€œIt is interesting to note that this phase has been enriched with the micro-business component wherein instead of direct cash payments, the participants receive products directly from partnering FMCG companies at factory prices, which allow them to start trading in their neighbourhoods at a competitive advantage, thereby maximising profits.
