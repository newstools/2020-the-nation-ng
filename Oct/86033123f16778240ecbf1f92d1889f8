 POPULAR gospel dance club Spirit of David has secured the services of a top filmmaker, Adekunle Nodash Adejuyigbe for an upcoming movie project. The dance club announced the new project which has the inclusion of a movie and movement. The project, ‘Massive: The Movie and Movement’, will have Nodash occupying the position of the film’s director. Others on the team include Debo Oluwatominu, Tolulope Akintan, and Akinwale Sodade. The project, according to the Spirit of David, follows the tradition of the 23-year-old club to host an annual show that coincides with Nigeria’s Independence anniversary. In 2007 and 2009, it held hearts spellbound with the reality TV show, ‘Celebrity Takes2’, and in 2015, its stage production, ‘The Butcher and the Bridge,’ drew accolades from many for its portrayal of love, hope, and triumph. The Massive project will kick off with a movement — strategic curating of relevant discourses and events that will culminate into the production of ‘Massive: The Movie.’ The movie is scheduled to open in cinemas around the world in 2021. The Club’s Head of Shows, Tokunbo Demide throws more light about the movie project saying, “’Massive: The Movie’ is not just the club’s hundredth show but an artistic venture shot in Nigeria with some of the nation’s leading producers, writers, choreographers, actors and a host of other professionals in contents featured from around the world.”
